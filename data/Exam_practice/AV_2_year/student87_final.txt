Nobody would deny that inequality is still a great concern of the modern society. It affects lots of people and artists are not an exception. Some of the creators earn millions whilst others, by no means less creative, barely make ends meet.
The question is should the government solve this problem?
I agree that situation that some artists are in is really difficult: after graduation they work all day long without any recognition and consequently without decent payment. As a result, unwilling to stay hungry anymore, they either change their profession or, in some tragic cases, end their life. But, to be honest, I do not see, how government can possibly change the situation. I think that it is more likely to be solved by the artistic community itself. More successful artists may channel some of their resources into the support of young painters or organize events where beginning creators can draw attention of patrons of art to their works. Or maybe the universities where art is studied should provide artists with possibility of exhibiting their works in the galleries.
But on the other hand, some people believe that government must deal with issues like this. Mostly by funding the institutions connected with art or providing financial support for unlucky artists. But firstly, how the government should decide which ones of the artists are worth supporting and which ones are not? Secondly and very unfortunately, in many communities helping artists cannot be governmentâ€™s first priority due to many other unresolved fundamental issues. 
To conclude, I would like to say that problems of struggling artists are solvable but probably without engagement of the administration.
