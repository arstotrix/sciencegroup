People have been arguing about what is the main criterion of a good word since ancient times. Some people claim that it should be well-paid only. Others object that working without joy and satisfaction is a total waste of time. Both opinions have strong argument for and against but does the right choice really exist?
On the one hand, you cannot be a great professional if do not you love you job. If you are not fond of what you do, you can be neither good painter nor financial specialist. It is necessary to be the best. And it means that this beloved work would not be only a way to earn some money. In addition, working for money, working for working only can finally cause depression. We should realize that we live only once and there will be no chance to try again to live for ourselves.
On the other hand, nowadays we live in a world where money forces us to worry about it even if we really do not want to. Even if you do not have huge family, borrow money from the bank or buy a new car, you have to pay for government, taxes, army, public service etc. In this case, good salary can buy you tranquility and absence of problems with society. 
To sum up, I would like to say that there is no right answer. Everyone should make this choice for self. And I believe, that it is possible to find balance between well-paid and beloved work.
