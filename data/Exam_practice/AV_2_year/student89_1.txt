You are lucky if you have a job you are fond of. And you are twice lucky if you have a job you like and it brings you a lot of money. But which of these is more important: money or happiness? Or maybe these two depend on each other? Let’s think about it in details.
Personally, I tend to believe that satisfaction of your occupation is really crucial because people spend a bigger amount of their life doing their work: in offices, in factories, in cars. And if our life is given us not for enjoy then what for? Their job bringing joy, people can delight with their occupation, they may do their work more diligently. In spite of this, money is believed to be significant no less than happiness. The main argument in favor of money is people say that you won’t be happy before you earn a big number of money. From this point of view, in our world it is money that dictates us the rules. But if you begin to rush for money, to waste all your time for it, your life is unlikely to be joyful. It is vicious circle: you think that you will be happy if you earn money, you begin to do it, you feel unsatisfied, you think you need more money – and it is going on and on.
Overall, choosing between a good salary and an enjoyable job, one mustn’t forget that life is a thing that we should delight with.
