The graph gives information about types of student accommodation over 5 decades (1960s-2000s).
In the 1900s about 35 percent of students shared house or flat with other and the percentage of students lived paying guest with a host family was the same. However, in the 2000s the figures had seen significant changes. The first had risen by just over 70, while the second had dramatically fallen by 5. The number of students hall of residence was 15 and those who lived with their own family in the beginning were similar. By the end of the five decades they both had become about 13 percent.

A more detailed look at the graph reveals that the number of students living in hall of residence fluctuated, while the number of those living with parents after stagnating in the 1980s and 1990s had increased. The former had been continuous and steady rising over all five decades, while the latter had been fallen in the same way.
Overall, the most noticeable changes involved the number of students who shared their living place with other students and those who lived with a host family. The difference between other two columns is much less marked.
