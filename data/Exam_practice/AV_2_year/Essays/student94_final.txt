All over the world thousands of TV-companies broadcast all major sport competitions such as football, ice-hockey, basketball, tennis and many others. It doesn't matter if it is winter or summer, day or night, you can always watch live broadcast from any country of any game you are interested in, on TV or on the Internet. But if we’ll always watch sports sitting on the couch in front of TV screen, would we have time or wish to practice sports ourselves?

According to my personal experience I can say that there is not enough sport on Russian public television, and I need more. Watching football on TV is one of my favorite leisure. Furthermore, I often watch it on the Internet. But sport broadcasts don’t discourage me to practice sports. On the contrary, twice a week I visit the university gym with my friends and at the week-end we often play football and basketball.

To my mind, it can’t be said that only TV-broadcast influents to the choice between watching and practicing. If one person doesn’t like sports, he will read a book, play video games or do anything else rather than watch or practice sports. And the other person who doesn’t imagine his life without sports will definitely find time to watch a game of his favorite team or player and to practice his favorite sport. If I had a choice – to watch football or to play the same thing with my friends I couldn’t give a quick answer. It depends on many circumstances – the weather, the number of mates I can play with, my physical condition, the degree of importance of the match I’m going to watch.

At the conclusion it can be said that everybody has his own choice between broadcasts and real practice. I think it doesn’t discourage youths to take part in sports but maybe their own thoughts and persuasions stop them, because if you have a wish and a dream to practice sports, nothing can stay your way, even such little thing as sport on TV.
