The graph provides information about how kinds of students’ accommodation had been changing since 1960s till 2000s. 
The graph shows that number of people choosing room in a shared house or flat had experienced a steady growth over the years, meanwhile popularity of being a paying guest in a host family had been falling steadily, though both of them started from the same percentage. Other two options had seen fluctuations during these five decades. 
A closer look at the graph shows that at the beginning of the period the most popular options were living in a shared flat (35 percent) and living in a host family (35 percent as well). Living in the dormitory and staying at home with the family had also the same level of popularity – both options were chosen by 15 percent of students. However, by the end of fifty years numbers had changed significantly. 70 percent of students preferred room in a shared house, while living with the host family was chosen only by 5 percent. Percentage of people living in the two remaining types of accommodation stayed almost the same – about 13 percent each.
Overall, number of students living in a shared flat and number of students living in a host family had experienced the most noticeable change; in 2000s the former had become the most popular option while the latter had become the least popular one.
