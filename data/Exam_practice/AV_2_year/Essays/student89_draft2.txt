There is an unfair situation about distribution of money in our world. Some people, such as modern artists, receive huge amounts of cash, whereas other people do not have money even for daily food! But should governments put their hands to solve this problem or they should not?
On the one hand, it seems to be none of their business at all. Some people manage to earn big sums of money due to their skills, some do not – whose problem is it? Why on earth a person who has worked hard and can have made a profit from it should share his money with a lazybones?
On the other hand, one can argue that government should raise taxes for rich people and lower ones for the poor. It does not seem to be a fine solution, because such an experiment took place once in the Soviet Union. “From each according to his ability, to each according to his need” – this phrase by Carl Marx became a powerful weapon in Bolsheviks’ hands in their fight against the wealthy. Dekulakization was a terrible act of terror, and from my point of view it was a big mistake of Soviet government.
All in all I want to say that there are some issues in our world that seems not to disappear ever. One of them is inequality of people’s means. One cannot just change it in the blink of an eye. But you can voluntary help people who are not able to effort food – without any pressure from government.
