Creative people, like artists, have to generate new ideas and work hard to survive on the money from selling their products. Many modern artists are famous and successful, so they have huge income from their work, other artist never achieve success. I think this is the usual form of career ladder, that common at many areas, and government should not regularity this process.
It is reasonable, that some people want to own and can afford to buy some unique artwork. They want to pay for beautiful and skillful work. For these reasons, I would agree that government should not prevent artist from requesting high price on it. If it is worth it, artwork can reach incredible prices, for example, paintings sold at auctions for a few million dollars.
As I said before, in many cases, artists are like business people. To sell your products with high prices, you had to work a lot, build a reputation. For other unknown artists this prices politics may seems unfair, but like in business â€“they should not give up, accept this situation and try to become successful. It is true that popular artist spend years to achieve good results, master their skills, studying subject to be in demand in the market. I think they deserve to assign high prices for their works and government should not prevent this.
In conclusion, I want to say, what every person chooses for himself how to spend his or her money. And every person earn money as they can, so if you are unsuccessful artist, you might work hard and develop your skills, or try something else to earn
