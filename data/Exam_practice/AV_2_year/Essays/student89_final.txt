Due to television, sport becomes a more and more popular thing to watch today. This situation is supposed to prevent young people from doing sport. Let’s look at this problem a bit closer and try to find out whether it is true or not.

Personally I believe that sport, and especially spectator sports, attracting attention of millions of young people, gives them an idea that sport is interesting, exciting, and that you may enjoy it as sportspeople do. Besides, there are many famous sportsmen, who are role models for many individuals around the world. For the young it is very important to have an example to follow. And very often these famous sportspeople happen to be such an example. It encourages the young to do sport, to try to achieve heights as their favorite sportsmen did it. There are a lot of small villages in Russia, and in every of them there are teens, who dream about great sport, wish to become Olympic champions. And I do believe that for many of them sport on television and their own role models in sport play a really important role in their sport lives. And I do not think that lack of television make them to do a lot of sport.

There is a trend nowadays to accuse television of all human’s sins. Maybe sometimes it is rightful, but there are good features of TV too! And one of them is propaganda of healthy lifestyle and sport – and it works. In Russia, at least.
