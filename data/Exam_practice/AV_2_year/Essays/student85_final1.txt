Nowadays, the number of people who do sports themselves are still decreasing. They believe, that the reason for  it is the developing of TV broadcasting.. Children watch many different sport programs and aren’t interested in doing sports activities.
I partially disagree with this statement. In my opinion, watching your favorite sport competition on TV encourages you to be like your revered athlete. Firstly, there are many modern professional racers who were inspired by Formula 1 legends to be as great racers as their idols. The following your idol footstep  is inherent to all sports. Secondly, professional athletes have very impressive earnings, from prize money, advertising contracts with popular brands and so on. Young people always dream of wealth and fame, so if they choose a sport career, the dream will come true. Finally, regularly doing exercise helps you to keep fit and you feel more confident.
On the other hand, a big part of the young are not keen on doing sports, but they are enjoy watching  it at home. They believe that watching sport is spectacular and you are not being  exhausted from a everyday workouts. Moreover, professional sport is very risky; you can easily get injured doing exercise or during a competition. Sometimes people cannot afford to do sport professionally because of expensive sport equipment, so they can only watch it on TV.
I think you must do sports. Although being an athlete is dangerous, risky and sometimes quite expensive, it is worth it. Just imagine yourself as an Olympic Games medalist, and you will have an aim to achieve.
In conclusion, I want to say that if you are keen on sports, you have an idol, don’t watch TV anymore, keep fit, do a lot of hard work and you will be able  to be the  someone else’s idol.
