Nowadays TV broadcasts a lot of sport programs and tournaments in different kinds of sport. After years of championships in such popular types of sport like a football, basketball, baseball and so on, sport becomes a famous show with its own celebrities. It's evident enough that TV affects children, because they absorb whole information from it, and depending on the type of that information, this can be positive or negative influence. One of the most talked discussions is about danger of watching such broadcasts like a sports championships and telecasts by children.
 

Some people think that excessive amount of broadcasts of football championships, basketball tournaments etc. causes a decrease in children's activity in these sports. Children will not be interested in playing football if they see the difference between their own skills and those of famous football stars. This gulf between their skills and those of famous football stars disappoints children so much that they give up and don't even try to play.
 

On the other hand, there is a point of view that watching such tournaments only provokes additional interest in children's minds. If they see such famous persons in action, they will try to follow in sportsmen’s footsteps and this will boost children’s activity. In addition, watching records of these games will teach them some tricks and tactics, which they can use in real match.
 

 

I agree with the opinion that children are very sensitive to achievements of others, so there is no problem in the growth of popularity of telecasting such programs like a football championships. TV produces a lot of more negative information than simple sports tournaments so I don't think that sport programs are the main problem. On the contrary, I think that watching sport programs is useful for the young because it teaches them to overcome their limits for great results.
