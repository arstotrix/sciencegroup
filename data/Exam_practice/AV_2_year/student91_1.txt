Nowadays we live in the age of extremely rapid development of technologies. Things like television or any other mass media are capable of affecting people’s minds and opinions. One of the issues that fall under such kind of influence is sports. There is quite a widespread opinion that constant discussing of sport in television prevents people, especially the youngest of us, from doing any sport themselves. The point of the current essay is to look at this kind of opinion from different points of view.
It cannot be denied that such point of view may be considered rather strange by most people. In fact, how can a TV-show about sports dissuade a young person from taking it up? It is obvious that various shows and broadcasts will increase the youth’s awareness of sports and, as a result, will increase the number of sportspeople among us. Moreover, if a young sportsperson is shown on TV, they get fame and popularity, which can be another reason for young people to become one.
Of course, the situation is much more complicated than it appears to be. It cannot be denied that we have different kinds of TV-shows, and some of them depict sport as something cruel, violent and unfair. There are numerous prime-time talk shows, in which fragile slender women and bodybuilders with a severe stare describe all sorts of unbearable things they had to face during their workouts. It goes without saying that such things can discourage youths should be plural and indefinite from taking up any sport.
To sum it up, I would like to stress that the continuous coverage of sport in mass media is not actually a problem. Undoubtedly, it has some certain negative consequences, but not any more than the exaggerating of any other issue has.
