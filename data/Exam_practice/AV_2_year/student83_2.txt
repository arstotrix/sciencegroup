There is no doubt that the better things could happen with you is having an enjoyable job. Many people are sure that a good salary better than low-paid favorite work. I tend to think that there is a way out.
On the one hand, each of us has a common desire to reach for exalted position and forget about money. Also lots of people feel responsible for they families and don’t allow for themselves to waste time on unprofitable work even it is dream job. 
On the other hand, enjoyable job improve the efficiency of working. Person stays in a harmony of themselves and all world around. 
I think there is golden meal. If you want to reach for big earnings and have enjoyable job, you can reach a compromise and make a favorite thing of your hobby. Also nobody said that your enjoyable job could bring less money than work which you hate. 
In conclusion I would like to say that there is just your choice to go for dream job, master an area you like and make a good salary there.
