For a really long time people have been asking themselves a question - what is more important: being able to do job you love or to earn a lot of money? There are several diverse opinions on this subject.
Personally, I believe that being passionate about your job is a key to happiness and, in most cases, to succes. They say, choose a profession you love and you will not have to work a single day of your life. There are lots of people out there who have chosen office work over something they really enjoy (for example, history or art) just so they can earn more. Most of them detest what they are doing, hence poor results, low level of self-confidence, constant feeling of disappointment. What is more, they sometimes end up with really low salary, because they are not interested in their work and have no ambitions. In my opinion, interest in what you are doing is what makes you good and efficient worker. I think that even though profession you love does not have a potential to bring you lots of money, your talant, enthusiam and professionalism will help you make a fortune. And even if it won’t happen, you at least will not ruin your life by doing something you genuinely hate.
But there is an opposing opinion. Some people believe that a job that does not bring you money is not even worth doing. They seem to treat people who do not earn much in a really condescending way, calling them «losers». They somehow find everyone who is enjoying themselves while working childish and light-minded. But such people are working hard to support their family, so it is possible to understand their point of view.
To conclude, I would like to say that everyone should be able to live their own life and make their own choices. But also we all should not forget about respecting each others opinion.
