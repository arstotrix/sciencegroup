Sport is one of the most popular themesin media after politics and maybeeconomics – anyone can check it him/herself on any newspage on the Internet. The government calls it “healthy lifestyle popularization”. But it seems that there are some people who are concerned that sport shows on television have only a negative impact on young people’s minds and discourages them from sport. 
Let us look at the subject through the eyes of the negativists’ group representatives.These people might think that sport competitions awe youths so much that they lose any motivation for sport, frightened of being ridiculous. I think that it is wrong – youths are competitive; a youngster always wants to show the world that he/she is the best; these strangers on TV can do this, and so can he.
The thing is, proficiency in some kind of sport moves one to a very high level, it makes one look much “cooler” in the eyes of others, especially children, who are more excitable and already obsessed, while not yet realizing it, by the idea of social hierarchy. Sport gives them opportunity to be swifter, higher, stronger, to push beyond the limits.
Of course, highlighting different kinds of sport helps young people who are naturally active and inclined to sport to find their own way. Who, if not the popularizers, would tell them of the marvelous snowboarding sport if they live in the vast plains of Eastern Europe and never leave the country? I personally fell in love with it after a video, and I would be really happy if I had a chance to learnto snowboard properly.
Sport is something that is cool, exciting and beautiful, at least shown so. Everyone picks what is the most important for him/her, but I see no reason (except having a low self esteem, which is fortunately the problem of the minority) why these absolutely positive features would diminish or destroy one’s motivation to go in for sport.
