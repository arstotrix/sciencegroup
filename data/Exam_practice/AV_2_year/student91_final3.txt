Nowadays most people in the world have a possibility of getting education at school. But there is no common opinion about the age when one should begin their formal education. Some argue that children should start school at four years old, while the others believe that the proper age for beginning formal education is about seven or eight years.

To my mind, it is better for children to start school as early as possible. Having beginned theig formal education in the age of four, they would have already got more or less used to the process of studying by the age of eight. I guess, that will make benefit for them in the future. Moreover, children will have more chance to have their talents discovered, which will help them find their place in life as adults. 

My nephew first went to school just a few days after she turned six. His mother first planned to send him there at seven years old, like most parents in the country do. However, the boy happened to be a very smart and yet terribly disobedient child, so by his fifth birthday already my sister was eager to send him to school, where he would be given an opportunity to apply his sharp mind and infinite energy. A year later, even though my nephew was the youngest pupil in the class, his marks were the highest, and all the teachers admired him despite of his discipline which sometimes appeared to be quite poor. Personally, I suppose that there are many children like my nephew, for whom waiting for the sixth or the seventh birthday to start school would become a cruel torture.

To sum it up, I would like to stress that the question stated actually comes to the question of the basic purpose of primary school. If we tend to suppose that the first years at school are given to children in order to have them taught how to study and to have their talents discovered, then beginning formal education from the age of four would be a truly great idea.
