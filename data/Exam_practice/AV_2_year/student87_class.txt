Education is essential for the well-being of modern society, but the question is at what age it is better for children to begin to go to school.
From my point of view children should not start school until they are at least six. Mainly because there should be left some time for kids to just be kids, to have free and careless childhood. It is such a great pressure for the young children to be forced to sit through the lessons, without any ability to move and it is always really difficult for little kids to concentrate on some kind of task. What is more, I think starting school at 4 or 5 years can cause some problems with children’s health – like problems with posture or bad eyesight.
But some people believe that it is important for kids to start school at a really early age. It seems that such people are afraid that their child will be less developed and less clever than other kids. They give their little kid a really hard time in order to make him or her more successful later in life. Intentions of such people are definitely good, reasonable and quite understandable, but does it really worth it? Leaving a little bit more freedom for your child will not make him underdeveloped.
To make a conclusion, I would like to say that people should take in account all the features of their young children and try not to sacrifice their happiness in order to make them more successful.
