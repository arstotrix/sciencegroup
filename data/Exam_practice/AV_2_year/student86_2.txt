Some people guess that it is more important for a job to be enjoyable than to be well-paid. Other people are sure that a good income provides a good life.
I suppose that it is a big luck if you know what you want to be and it is a double luck if the occupation you like is profitable. Unfortunately, for most of people it is too hard to find out an enjoyable job because from the very beginning at school students choosing an occupation prefer a well-paid job to a job they like. I found it a wrong decision but it looks like there is no a right one, because you are unhappy if you do not like what you are and you are unhappy if you are not satisfied with the money you earn. To my mind, being what you want to is one of the most important things in life. I see two ways to manage it. Firstly, if you are a good professional you will have good money anyway. Secondly, a well-paid but dislikable job can help you to become what you want with the money you have earned.
There is one more point of view. Some people think that you can be happy with a job you do not like if you earn a lot of money. I do not agree with this statement, because if you are not fond of the job you have, you are not fond of the life you live. 
To sum up, I would like to say that a job have a great impact on our life, that is why it is very important not go against the grain, because we always regret about the opportunities we have lost. And even if you are wealthy you may understand that being a rich is not what you really want to be.
