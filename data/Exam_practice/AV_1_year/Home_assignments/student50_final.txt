Certainly, the majority of people are in favour of online-shopping. They adduce such reasons: first and most importantly we save our time and sometimes money, buying goods via the Internet. Often there is no time for going shopping to another part of the city- people are constantly busy nowadays. Another benefit of buying online is that we can find some unusual and rare things, which are not presented in the shops of our city or country.

Nevertheless there is an opinion that online-shopping reflects adversely on people. We spend more and more time in front of the computer, and less time on the street. Also online-shopping brings to nought communication between people. What is more, choosing some thing we can't see it alive, can't touch it. For example, it is extremely inconvenient while buying clothes as you don't have any possibility to try it on.

Taking all the aforesaid into consideration, we can confidently say that online-shopping has greatly improved lives for the consumers in contempt of some disadvantages. All in all it is extremely useful invention of mankind, that has made life easier.
