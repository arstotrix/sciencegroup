What was your recent bargain? A brand new bag, a cell phone or a pair of wheels? Did you buy it online or did you go to the shopping mall?  Some of us think that online shopping is very convenient. Others believe that it is not safe to shop in the Internet. Here I would like to talk about positive and negative aspects of online shopping.
To begin with everybody would agree that one of the advantages of buying things online is that you can buy something not leaving your home. Especially teenagers prefer shopping from home because they are too lazy or do not have enough time to go to the shopping center. What is more, it is a great advantage that you can spend more time choosing what you want and what you like when you are shopping online. Generally when people go shopping they are getting tired and as a consequence they want to return home as fast as they can and that is why people buy things they do not like or clothes that do not suit them. To proceed with the topic it can also be stressed that in online shops things on stock are often cheaper than the same things in department stores. It is obvious because internet shops do not pay a lot for the rent as shops in malls do.
However, together with the pros, there are also cons. It is believed that sometimes goods which you buy online may look different in reality and a lot of consumers are scared of this. We can understand them because no one wants to receive a thing which is not the best quality. Also, delivery can last for weeks. This is a big disadvantage too, as there are clothes you need only for one season, so if you get your swimming suit in autumn instead of summer, you will be disappointed. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that these two points of view can exist together. So many people so many minds. As for me, I myself prefer to shop on the Internet for the convenience, speed and better prices.
