Nowadays travelling is becoming more and more popular hobby or even way of life.  Few years before only wealthy people could afford flying from one country to another, however today with help of low-cost airlines almost everyone can visit places they want. No doubt that these cheap flights have changed whole airlines industry. But are they a blessing in disguise or should we relate to them with skepticism?
Some people believe that low-cost airlines are very convenient for travelling. Mostly because their prices are much cheaper compering to prices of large airline companies. One does not need to overpay for extra services that are always included in cost of tickets. It makes prices low without decreasing safeness. Moreover, tickets are very easy to book online and all details are very understandable and simple. Most of low-costers are punctual and almost never delay flights. So all these arguments prove that low-cost flights may be more beneficial than flights provided by large companies.
On the other hand, there is an opinion that low-costers have more cons than pros. Firstly announcing cheap price they usually turn out to be more expensive because every service should be paid separately, for example heavy luggage, food or choosing particular seat as ticket donâ€™t usually have a seat number and most of them are uncomfortable. In addition, time and place of flight may be very unsuitable, therefore getting to the airport may be not as cheap as flight. In the end, whole sum may be not very different from price of other airlines companies especially during the off-season.
To sum up, although low cost airlines do not provide highly comfortable services, they still give people opportunity to travel safely. And this is the most valuable argument for me.
