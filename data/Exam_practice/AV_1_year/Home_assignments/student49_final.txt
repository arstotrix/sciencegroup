Since the beginning of twentieth century, sport has developed from a healthy hobby to big business and an object of passion of billions of people. Consequently, the price of victory has grown with the significance of sport. However, is the modern sport indeed about winning?
It is true that teams and sportsmen have an impressive motivation to win tournaments these days. On the one hand, it is the matter of money. All the income of sportsmen, including salaries and prizes, depend on their competitive success. Moreover, sportsmen are forced to compete in tournaments and win trophies as much as possible. The career of professional sportsmen is short, therefore they have to earn as much money as they can. On the other hand, impressive performance can make sportsmen a public idol and legend, consequently glory and success of sport victories are very tempting for young and ambitious sportsmen. 
On the other hand, it is wrong to forget about other sources of money and success that exist in modern sports. Sport is a big business, and it is common that interest in money will be stronger than interest in glory and competitive spirit. In other words, sportsmen sometimes pay more attention to advertising contracts and TV shows than to training and performance. Moreover, we should also take into account illegal ways of making money, such as fixed matches.
To sum up, the price of a victory in modern sport is extremely high. However, the reason to compete for many sportsmen is not the honor – it is the income. Overall, the main thing in modern sport is not the victory – the money is.
