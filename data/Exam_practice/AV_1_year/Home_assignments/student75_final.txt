Due to the recent technological progress, the Internet has influenced almost every sphere of human’s life. The concept of shopping has also remarkably changed. Thousands of consumers buy all possible goods - from food to electronics – through the Internet not even getting up from the sofa. Nonetheless, shopping malls do not seem to get emptier – they are still full of consumers. So, perhaps online shopping isn’t as beneficial for people as it seems to be?
No doubt, the main advantage of online shopping is connected with saving time. Indeed, about 20 minutes of browsing and several clicks are much less time consuming than hours of wondering from one store to another. Besides, the Internet provides us with opportunity to access shops of other countries without having to visit them, as international delivery is obviously much chipper then a plain ticket.  Finally, home delivery enables a customer to check the good or try on some piece of clothes in a comfortable atmosphere, whereas in a shop people inevitable suffer from haste.
On the other hand, online shopping has some serious downsides. The first inconveniency comes with no opportunity to see the good live, examine it, try on and decide, whether it suits the customer. Moreover, sometimes the description on the website differs drastically from the reality. In this case shopping turns out to be disappointment. One more drawback refers to the system of online payment. Usually it’s rather safe. However, once a problem appears it can take one huge effort to return their money. No wonder, plenty of people are simply scared to shop through the Internet!
Thus, having analyzed both sides of the coin, I tend to say there is no certain opinion. Both way of shopping are not ideal, so everyone makes their won choice, based on personal preferences and experience.
