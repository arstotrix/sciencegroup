Essay "The growth of online shopping has greatly improved life for the consumers"

Over the last decade online shopping has become an integral part of lives of millions of people all over the world. These people seem to be completely satisfied with such a way of buying things. So, what are the reasons for passion for this kind of shopping?   

It is true that a lot of people prefer online shopping because it saves their valuable time. They now do not need to spend long hours in huge malls choosing a suitable dress or the newest model of TV set. Besides, there are disabled people who can not leave their flats. For them online shopping is the most convenient way of making a purchase. Furthermore, some consumers claim that there is wide variety of things presented.  

On the other hand, many people do not say anything in favour of online shopping because it does not improve their lives. The main reason for it is law quality of the things shops offer to its consumers. You can not be completely sure that it is a high quality product. Moreover, the way of paying for the purchase seems to be unreliable. There can be some problems with privacy: an online shop can collect numbers of credit cards to use them illegally in future. Finally, the shop may deliver a thing you did not even buy. 

In conclusion, though online shopping has its own advantages and disadvantages, it improved life for its consumers. Every day a lot of people begin using its options and then can not imagine life without it. To my mind, online shopping is not a bad thing, but you should choose things you want to buy attentively. There is still no guarantee of high quality of purchases in the Internet.
