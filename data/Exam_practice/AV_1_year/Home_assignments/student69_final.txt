As the internet has become extremely popular nowadays,  it became common to buy online. Nevertheless, the benefit of doing shopping online for a consumer is arguable. Many people believe that buying things online has its number of drawbacks.
In the first place, it is very convenient to shop online as you save your time and energy, for instance, when  you are busy or not able to go and buy something you need for some reason. In addition, on the internet one has got an opportunity to look through the huge amount of production round the clock that allows to make a better choice for the shorter period of time. And finally, shopping online is cheaper  for consumer because there is no extra charge for the rent that is common to pay when you buy  things in a «real» shop.
Nevertheless, shopping online has its downsides. First of all, the «online» look of the production does not always reflects its real look, because there can be both bad or «too good», fake photos that make it easy to sale fake or low-quality products online. For example, on the net there are millions of fake Louis Vuitton bags that are posed as originals. Further on, easy «one-click» purchasing makes people lazier and greedier because online they can buy as much as they want moving only one finger.
To sum up, although online shopping does not always offer quality goods, its advantages outweigh disadvantages because they usually save our priceless time and energy, which are above all.
