It is popularly believed that whether a company is successful is determined by the mental state of their employees - if they are happy or not. Should employers do their best to make their staff happy? Or are there some factors that contribute mostly to the company’s success?
There is no doubt that when people are happy or in a good mood they work more efficiently. Firstly, their work should be challenging but not extremely demanding or  tedious so that employees do not lose the desire to work and achieve better results. What is more, come personal achievements should be encouraged by paying perks or by giving benefits, which also inspires employees, and as a result they work more effectively.
On the other hand, employees’ being happy can depend on different factors, for example on their coming to work at any time or being allowed to be late and not being  punished in some way for it. In this way the company will hardly achieve any significant results or success. That is why employers should maintain the discipline which, probably, may make some employers feel sad.
On balance, the success of a company really depends on the happiness of their staff, but there are some regulations that also should exist.
