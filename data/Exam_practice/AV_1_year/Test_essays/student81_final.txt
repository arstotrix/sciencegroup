Sports involving animals should be banned.
Nowadays people can choose any type of activities they want. In the XXI century there is unbelievably wide range of all sorts of sports and entertainment. People start to think that everything in the world is certainly made to entertain them and anything can and should be put in this “chain of amusement”. On the other hand, some people start to become aware of the damage that approach can create.
I also think that we shouldn’t practice mindless use of nature for our entertainment. To be specific, I think that sports involving animals should not be allowed.
Firstly, a lot of sports require enormous effort and self-discipline. People cannot ask animals directly about their feelings, and it’s obvious that animals can be dangerously stressed in such conditions.
Secondly, sport activities are created by human beings as the type social interaction with certain rules. For animals it is not natural to take part in such type of activities, not only can they be physically damaged by such activities, but also frustrated by hype around sport events.
Finally, in my opinion, sports involving animals change the whole concept of sports itself. I suppose, that the type of physical activities that were started in Greece as Olympic Games are a triumph of human body and discipline. 
To conclude, some people think that animal sports just widen the range of activities people should be entertained by. But, on the other hand, this whole idea of using animals for personal purposes can be dangerous for animals and our relationship with them.
