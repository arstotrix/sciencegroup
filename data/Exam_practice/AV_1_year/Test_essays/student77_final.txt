Some people think that the success of a company depends on the happiness of its employees. It means that the company can achieve better results if people there get pleasure from their work. To my mind, it is true that the happier employees are, the more effectively company works.
Firstly, being happy means having good relationships with your colleagues and your boss. You work together effectively and achieve great results. Secondly, happy people are commonly well-paid and as a result realize their importance to the company and also show their devotion to it. What is more, when you are happy you think that you can solve all the problems and you also have a desire to work.
However some people think differently. They claim that happiness of the employees is not an important factor for the success of a company. According to them, people should be highly-qualified and motivated for their job. What they forget is that highly-qualified but not happy employees often change companies they work for. That is why it is really important for the employers to make appropriate conditions for their staff to make people happy.
All in all, I still believe that success of a company is impossible without happiness of its employees.
