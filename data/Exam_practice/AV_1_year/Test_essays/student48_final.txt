The success of a company depends on the happiness of its employees
Nowadays there are a lot of big companies and the rivalry between them  is very high. So what is the key to success and survival for them in modern world?
There are a lot of factors which influence the success of a company in the whole. Some people think that happiness of its employees is a crush thing to it. Firstly, when workers are happy, they are satisfied of their job, inspired to do more and more. Secondly, they are ready to work which means that they are interested in achieving results and job for them isn’t just a way of earning money but an integral part of life. What’s more, the mood of every employee has an impact on common dynamics. 
However, there is another point of view on this statement. Success of a company may not rely on feelings and emotions its workers have but on their experience of work and proficiency. If employees are hardworking and responsible for what they do, their happiness won’t matter at all. Moreover, qualified professionals always do their best in a field of their investigations and research. Abilities and special skills, attentiveness and being always on a ball are the main points for success of a company. 
All in all, the success of a company can’t be made just of happiness of its employees but also their attitude to work and background skills.
