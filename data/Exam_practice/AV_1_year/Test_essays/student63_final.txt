Nowdays people believe that successful performance of the company relies mainly on happiness of the employees. But there are some people and analytics that think that other conditions are needed to be kept in mind too. So how do you build a successful and profitable company?
Keeping employees happy is not as easy as it seems to be. As employer many methods can be used in order to make your employees happy, for example feedback is a great way to listen to your employees and take the notes of things that concerns them most in the working process, in order to eliminate all the troubles and make them happy.
On the other hand, some people believe that keeping your employees happy should not be a main goal for employers in building successful company. They believe, that as an employer you should keep employees under pressure and make them work in hard conditions, so they can learn how to overcome difficulties in future by themselves without asking your opinion, so you should not base your company only on the happiness and feedback.
All in all, I believe that in order to build successful business model, both methods should take place.
