Nowadays there are a lot of disputes about companyâ€™s success and ways of getting it. So, is it depend of the happiness of its employees?
I truly believe that it does. Firstly, people how are happy will be more interested in their work, than those how are sad would prefer to think about their troubles. Secondly, happy people will make more efforts to do their work, while disappointed people will do it as far as they were ordered.  At last, people how are in troubles would like to be noticed, so they will be talking with others and it is very unprofessional and sometimes even dangerous for all.
However, it has to be said that sometimes happy people could be more useful than others. For example, they can be so interested in themselves that they do not see anything and anybody around them.
To conclude, I can say that both happy and unhappy people could have success in their work, but probably, those who are happy have a little bit more chances.
