The success of the company depends on the happiness of its employees.
In the past few years the structure of companies (and market in general) has changed considerably. The companies have become bigger and the work and cases have become more difficult. So a lot of people are staying in permanent stress and it probably affects their ability to work. But is it the main factor? Does well-being of a company depend on the happiness of its employees?
On the one hand, there is no doubt that if employees feel satisfied with their life-time balance, relationship in family, they will not get distracted from their work by these personal problems. A lot of people are trying to solve their personal problems during working hours. If person doesn’t have them, they will be more concentrated on work. Also happiness of employees undoubtedly depends on atmosphere in company. Good working environment will help employees feel encouraged or enthusiastic in their job.
On the other hand, mixing personal problems and cases at work is unprofessional. So people who are good at their own specialty don’t do that. There is a belief that professionals always stay emotionless at work and concentrated. Moreover, developing good working environment with the help of celebrations, some equipped space for dinner breaks are expensive and may lead to a situation, when employees are looking for a way to procrastinate. 
In conclusion,  I may say that I personally agree that company depends on happiness of their employees. It is clear, that all people are emotional creatures more or less. And their inner world will always reflect outside.
