Nowadays employers are interested in finding the professional workers that are dedicated to their profession. But it is not enough to make the company earn good money or take be on the top of the list of the most successful companies. There is a point of view that the success of the company depends on the happiness of the employees. I absolutely agree with this opinion and will explain why below.
In my opinion comfortable atmosphere is very important. If you work in the company where the  employees are friendly you would not be exhausted by the end of the day because you can always relay on your friends. The paid is very important too.  People who get paid enough money have a tend to work more effectively rather than those who do not like their salary. Good relationship with boss play a big role in the success of the company.  The employers should treat their workers in a fair way and make them willing working more for the company. 
However, some people think that happiness of the employees has no influence on the success of the company. It does seem that, for example, the employees of the Apple company smile 24 hours a day and feel themselves absolutely happy. In contrast, some of the works who feel depressed  or have problems at home try to work more to forget about their problems and to overcome difficulties.
In conclusion, I want to say that employers should do their best to make the workers feel themselves comfortable at their work.
