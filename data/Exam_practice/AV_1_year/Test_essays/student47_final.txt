Some people think that the success of a company depends mainly on its organization, other argue that in the main depends on its head, employees and guidance. My point of view on this problem is that the success of a company basics on the happiness of its employee.
In my opinion employees’ mood determines quality of work and its efficiency and the cause of it is that people can’t do their tasks when they are not needed, loved be their colleagues, encouraged by their chiefs. I consider work to be something that you should like to do and this, undoubtedly, depends on the above.
The most common argument against this is that the office is not a place for fun and relaxing. There you should work and receive money, the relationships between employees should be just official.
I can’t agree with this because the modern world is to anonym and evil, we need in some happiness even on the work.
Whereas, I can say that employers should do everything to please their employees.
