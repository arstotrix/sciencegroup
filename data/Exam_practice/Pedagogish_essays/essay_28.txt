Conventional wisdom runs that throughout the time the title of a book remains relevant both for the writer and readers. The title is more than just a set of the letter on the cover it is a kind of cipher that was created to be decode while reading and to uncover the core idea that was hidden fewer than thousand layers of words and thought. 

“The words of a poet writing about another battle and another war popular with patriotic Englishmen put Puerto Bello on the map”.  Three thousand years later saw Ruth Rendell progressing her London obsession to new length entitling her new jewel –  Portobello. Rendell loves the city and its different corners, each with its own atmosphere, features and characters. Her mission seems to be clear even from the very title: this is a book about Portobello. Which is absolutely fair may be called the scenery as well as the full-fledged atmosphere character that makes everybody who is in obeyed by the rules.
The novel is peppered with the depiction of Portobello Road. “The Portobello has a rich personality, vibrant, brilliant in color, noisy, with graffiti that approach art, bizarre and splendid.” An indefinable edge adds a spice of danger to it. The idea of fears marked by the tagline on the cover engenders sinister images in our mind. There is something hidden and withhold in it. Try as it might out mind is helpless to decode it at once thought we keep reading to unravel intertwines.  

To wrap it up I would like to quote the master – “there is nothing safe about the Portobello, nothing suburban. It is as far from the average shopping street as can be imagined” still we are already hooked and there is no way back. The only outcome is to read up to the end and embrace each plot twist the author prepared to us.
