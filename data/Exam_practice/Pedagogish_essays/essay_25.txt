Coincidence has always played a great part in the theatre of a person’s life. It is almighty. It is a power that nobody can take over. It can ruin your life and make you happy. It seems to have its own mind. 

The book “Portobello” by Ruth Rendel is a wonderful embodiment of the essence of coincidence. There are several characters, totally unknown by one another, and what makes the book so compelling and captivating is when you see the chain of coincidences that make them interact in a particular way. It is utterly fascinating to see those accidents that link them, and in this theatre Coincidence is a puppeteer that tugs the characters like puppets and bump them together. Like a spider Coincidence spins a web and sticks them so that they are unable to get free – and so the play begins.

We never see to the whole picture of our lives. We never get to realize how much of our breakthrough of our how many of our failures hinges upon coincidences. Writing these lines I am probably involved in one of the most crucial coincidences of my life, but this is the essence of coincidence – we never know what we are involved in. what it will lead to and how it will affect other people’s lives. I believe this is the bottom line of the “Portobello” book.
