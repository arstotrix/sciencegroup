The funny boy who wears out of fashion sweaters and the cool man who spends more than 20 pounds on a haircut – what in common do they have?

Marcus is being eaten at school because he isn`t up to the standard of «a teenager». He listens to Joni Mitchell while other kids listen to Snoop Doggy Dogg and he reads while other boys fiddle around. It makes him different and because he is different he feels uncomfortable and because he feels uncomfortable he could feel himself floating away from everyone. He could be quite happy at home until quite recently but after his mother had tried to commit a suicide he started to live in fear.

At first sight Will is a lucky man who lives like a lord: he sleeps with a lot of attractive women, he is a party person, he spends more than twenty pounds on a jacket, he earns more than forty thousand pounds a year and he doesn’t have to work.  He leads a lifestyle celebrated in glossy magazines. So we see an absolute distinction between these protagonists.

However, Will and Marcus are kindred souls because they are lonely!
Will isn’t happy as it seems. He puts on a mask of single father and tries to make a conquest of Rachel. Marcus doesn`t lie and pretend any different, he puts the card on the table. Ellie knows who and what Marcus is. They have different strategies but they have the common target to fight with loneliness. They try to overcome own fears, for instance, Will started to reassess his affinity with children. They help each other to achieve their aims.
