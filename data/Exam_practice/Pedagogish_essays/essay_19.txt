Ruth Rendell is an acclaimed author with descriptive power and general command of language who is well-known for her pulse-quickening novel ‘Portobello’ with subtle plot twists. Rendell weaves a gripping story where events from the past resurface with bizarre coincidences from the present when the son of a successful art dealer finds a wallet.  Her style has become ever more spare while retaining its subtle psychology and vivid sense of place. 

It is an open secret that both novelists and their publishers care very much about the title as it addresses and sensitizes its potential reader to a theme, even to a word. The title always points out who the novel is about or where it is set. However, Ruth Rendell gave her book the name ‘Portobello’ thus opening to us where the novel is set and creating some intrigue. The Portobello of Ruth Rendell's title of this psychological thriller is London's Portobello Street market, a major antiques fair. 

Moreover, this novel is full of suspense as it has several story lines. All the characters are very different and have their own fate: Lance and Uncle Gib with their money-making scams, Joel with his unregenerate days, Ella with her heartbeating love story, Eugene with his obsessions and addictions. Still, I believe, that the real protagonist of this novel is the street they met in. The Portobello road unifies all the characters, it knows all their weaknesses, imperfections, quirks and vices, it is a key to all the secrets. And the bottom line is: how can there be so many coincidences at this snaking up like a centipede street with all these jostling people and abundance of goods?

It is easy to presume that the stories that move us most are about the characters who transcend their own flaws and weaknesses to do something great. Nevertheless, all the characters are fading away comparing with this bright and always vivid market street.
