Subject: The order error 
Dear Ms Lawrence, It has unfortunately come to my notice that despite your promise you were not be able to deliver the additional order in time that is why we get only 100 bags on our trade show instead of 1000 bags. According to our paperwork on 15 July we ordered 1,000 promotional giveaway bags with printed matter about our products. Then three weeks later than deadline we got only 100 bags. During the telephone talk with us your company promised to provide the delivery of the additional bags on the day of the trade but , unfortunately, we never received the remaining bags. As you know, your commodities were very important for us and now since your error we lost the opportunity to make contact and communicate with some of our real and potential customers, which could affect our business. Moreover, you conducted the certain difficulties in conducting the trade show. As we have the paperwork of the order and the packing list that fix the specified delivery of 1000 bags instead of 100 bags, we insist that the error should have been picked up at your company's end. Finally, I would like to confirm that we want to cancel the purchase and that is why we are interested in full refund of our previous payments. Thank you for your understanding in advance. 
Best regards, 
Mary Potapova
