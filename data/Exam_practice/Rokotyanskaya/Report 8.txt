Subject: Failed delivery of the order



Dear Ms Lisa Lawrence,

With the reference to our appointment about organizing a trade show, I would like to complain about an incomplete shipment of 1,000 bags and pens with a corporate logo that I purchased on 15 July. I am complaining because, first, a parcel arrived three weeks later, on 17 November, than it was scheduled; second, shipment was 900 bags short.

When I learned of this problem, I phoned the company, and I was told that additional items would be delivered before the show started. However, your company failed to comply with its obligations. As a result, our enterprise did not manage to establish crucial networks and engage influential customers, which will have a negative impact on its performance.

In this light, I have to point out that the error took place at your end: the paperwork as well as the packing list, which were attached to the order, specified that the number of items to be delivered accounted for 1,000 bags rather than 100 ones. In confirmation of my claim, please find enclosed copies of the paperwork for the order and the packing list.

Due to the missed deadline, I would like to cancel my purchase and get full refund of my payment.

Looking forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Yours sincerely,

Natalia Konovalova

Event Manager
