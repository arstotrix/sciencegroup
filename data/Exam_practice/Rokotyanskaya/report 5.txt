The report regarding the security of senior managers of the South American subsidiary

The current economic and social problems in most countries of South America provided dramatic growth in criminal rate in this region. To be precise, increase in violent crime stood for 20 per cent last year. 42 cases of kidnappings took place last year, though there were 29 of them two years ago. 55 per cent of kidnappings involved business people and their families, as the highest level of social and financial inequality caused a situation, where only top managers and politicians have significant income and savings. Consequently, wealthy individuals and company executives are the key targets of criminals. Moreover, most of the recent crimes have been committed by gunmen, what causes not only hi-jacking cars and taking passengers hostage, but also killing drivers and wounding the victims. Average payment which the criminals demand to release a hostage stands for $1 million but it often exceeds this figure, especially when it comes to a representative of a foreign company. However, to omit the matter of money, it is necessary to mention, that 11 kidnap victims were killed last year, so the lives of the key staff of the company are at risk. Concerning all the threats mentioned, there is a necessity to provide bullet-proof security cars for each of the six senior managers and their families. As a security consultant, I am confident that $90000 per security car is a neglectable sum when it comes to the lives of people.
