Death Penalty Should Be Introduced in All US States

In the USA it is generally considered that death penalty is unethical and inhumane, it is also prohibited by the US legislation. Though, in some states this kind of punishment is practically exercised. And that is why there exist a lot of passionate rhetoric between the proponents and opponents of this issue. However, pro-arguments are more obvious. 

The first argument of the opponents finds its origin in the American Legislation and relates to the violation of human rights. It means that the court should not sentence to death the murderer because it would infringe on his right to life. Conversely, the proponents of death penalty argue that the murderer must be punished equally to his crime. They also declare, and it is statistically based, that the murderer causes potential harm even being imprisoned let alone after the discharge.

The second cons-argument is based on the economic issue: instead of exercising the senseless and pointless massacre it is much cheaper to put the person into a prison. At the same time the pro-argument for execution is the more meaningful solution: when it comes to the imprisonment, the tax burden imposed on victims becomes heavier because prisons are funded by the state by means of redistributed taxes, indeed. Victims could endure additional stress because they feel compelled to pay for the offenderâ€™s living.

Another large issue involved in this debate revolves around the guilt of the condemned. The opponents claim that innocent persons could be punished and it might be revealed just years later. As for the supporters, they believe that whatever the outcome the number of crime should decrease. And this rule is true for the states where death penalty is legalized.

Indeed, we can debate this issue numerous times for multiple reasons. However, in order to reduce crimes government must be at liberty to execute punishments, even death penalty.
