Subject: Promotional giveaway bags

Dear Ms Lisa Lawrence,

I wish to draw your attention to an issue we have with a recent order from yourselves. Not only was the delivery three weeks later than scheduled, but only 100 bags arrived instead of 1,000.
I expected that you would deliver the additional bags in time for the trade show, but this has not been the case. The error should have been picked up at the supplier’s end because when you deliver the order there were the paperwork and the packing list that specified 1,000 rather than 100 bags.
As you are aware, I am responsible for organising a stand at an important trade show. This order that was 900 bags short is severely impacting our business at the moment. We lost the opportunity to make contact and communicate with important customers because of this problem with the promotional giveaway bags.
Although, I appreciate that you are all very busy. I believe that I am entitled to cancel the purchase and ask you for a full refund of our payment.
I expect an email from yourself by 5pm today at the latest, to inform me how you are going to resolve this issue.

Yours sincerely,
Mariya Potapova
