Laws that ban offensive words make the world a better place

Recently the laws have been increasingly promulgated against the use of offensive words in public places, in media and advertising. As an example, in Russia was enacted banning the use of foul language in the media and movies. But is there something horrible in offensive words? Some people find it ordinary and acceptable. Others raise hotly debated social issue about prohibition of abusive language and support the anti-profanities laws. 

Opponents argue that offensive words help endure the stress and calm down. However, there is no denying that the use of obscene language harms mentality of people. Persons who face allegations of swear-words inspire of negative energy and become aggressive and irritable. Moreover, if parents use foul language it can unfavorably influence on their children in the future.  

There is also a point of view that people can express its opinions explicitly using offensive words. At the same time, such words drive for lots of quarrels and crimes. So, one abusive word can offend a person and he can accomplish rash act, as a murder.
 
One more argument of opponents is that most unquotable words underlie each language. Despite this fact, it impoverishes language and makes it come down. There are lots of languages and each of them has their own beautiful words. But people often replace literary language by obscene one. 

I personally consider laws should forbid the use of offensive words. It can safe people from mental disorder, decrease a number of murders and accidents, and also make our language more cultural and flatter. 

To sum up, itâ€™s clear that debate over using offensive words will not soon fade. But we all should understand, that foul language destroy our cultural society. Some people argue that a person has a right to speak free from restrictions, but only laws against four-letter words can provide the basis for making our humanity better.
