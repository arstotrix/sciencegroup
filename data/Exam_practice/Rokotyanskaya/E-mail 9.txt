Subject: Assistant Human Resources Manager position

Dear Alicia Mendez,

On behalf of our company, I want to thank you for taking the time to visit with us regarding our Assistant Human Resources Manager position. As I indicated during our phone conversation, a job offer was conditional on approval from the Board of Directors that has unfortunately not given their approval due to budget cutbacks. We expect that the situation may change in the next few months but I canâ€™t make any promises. You have a promising career ahead of you and I wish you success with your job search. I apologize for any inconvenience our delay may have caused you.

Kind regards
Mariya Potapova
Human Resources Manager
