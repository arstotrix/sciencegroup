Nowadays,  poverty is considered to be one of the most significant socialeconomical
problems in Russia, which perniciously affects the peoples’ everyday
lives. One of the its main causes, regarded with the imperfection of the
government management policy, is the low amount of investments made in
socially important fields of today’s life, such as science and medicine. As a
result, the low level of domestic techology involved in industrial processes
leads to the high cost of outcoming product. In combination with the low
average salary it makes the cost of living quite expensive. Moreover, low
level of social mobility in some cases does not allow to overcome financial
difficulties, which in order vastly decreases the quality of life. Undoubtedly,
poverty appears as a long-term problem, which can be gradually solved not
only by improving the micro and macroeconimical indicators, but also by
deep reconsidiration of the government social policy.
