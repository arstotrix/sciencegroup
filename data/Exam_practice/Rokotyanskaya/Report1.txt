Security  Measure Report

Executive summary

Security is one of the key factors that our company should guarantee to the staff. However, we have faced a dangerous tendency of increasing kidnappings among businessmen and members of their families in South America, where we have a subsidiary. So, we should take measures that will help to avoid negative consequences of possible crime. My research shows that the need for buying special equipment (bullet-proof security cars) exists, and I have outlined it in this report.

This report will look at:

More than a half of kidnappings involved businessmen and members of their families

The minimal price for releasing a victim is $ 1 million
