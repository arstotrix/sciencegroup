Report

The aim of this report is first of all to give recommendations regarding the company's South American subsidiary. I will then proceed to provide your company with a security solution that would help to mitigate the risk for company executives in this region.
Although so far we have never had grounds to complain about the security measures, in the last year there was 20 per cent increase in violent crime and approximately 45 per cent growth in kidnapping. It means that we have to review our security practices because kidnappers' key targets are wealthy people and company executives. Furthermore, 55 per cent of kidnappings involved not only business people but also their families.
Our senior managers are our most valuable assets, and we must therefore ensure that they could be in safety. Besides, in the case of kidnapping our company will have to pay the large ransom – $1 million or more – in order to release a senior manager. In addition to these overwhelming costs, nowadays 11 lives of staff are at risk.
Finally, with regard to the solution that should be implemented in order to protect staff and families, I would like at this stage to recommend to buy bullet-proof security cars for each of the six senior managers in the company's South American subsidiary. This security measure would decrease the risk for executives to get kidnapped by gunmen such as kill drivers or drivers of hi-jack cars who take passengers hostage. Moreover, it will cost only $90,000 per security car.
