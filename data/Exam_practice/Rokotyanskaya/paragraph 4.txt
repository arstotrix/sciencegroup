Some of the main reasons of the poverty in Russia are unemployment and low wages. The amount
of people without work or with insufficient salary has increased because of the financial crisis and
inflation. Next, the excessive alcohol consumption, which is a significant problem in Russia, leads to
inability of a man to work properly and as a consequence to the loss of the work. Another cause of
poverty is a lack of education which results in impossibility to get a high paid work. This problem
is rather important for people living in country-side and immigrants. Finally, the pensions in our
country are sufficiently low; as a result many old people are poor.
