The action in cinema and in theatre is percepted really differently, especially nowdays. The theatre today tries to be as expressive as it can, tries to find the different forms of telling the idea by being sometimes not really easy to understand, but being metaphorical and visually strange. It really likes to shock and to show the unexpected ways to see the reality. And the factor that helps to create the atmosphere and the immersion is the space of the theatrical action. It's limits are not so narrow as those ones on the screen, and it helps a director to reproduce bigger amount of details, which affect the way you feel and understand. The cinema on the other hand conversely attempts to be as close to a person as it can. And though it limits the freedom of a spectator by a camera shot, the director can make some accents. And it makes the narration more complex and connected. That is why the story in films can be told much easier and the acting of concrete actors can be more impressive then in theatre. But it creates a little bit more difference for actors, because in the theatre body expression sometimes means more then the facial one. In the cinema the way you move is also important, but the main work is done by mimics and speach.

So, although cinema and theatre use some similar ways of talking to the audience, still they are very different in their goals and expression.
