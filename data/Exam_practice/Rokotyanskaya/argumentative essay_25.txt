Businesses should hire employees for their entire lives

Lots of things in our life depend on a job: what we do, who we communicate with. Dismissing is a point of concern for employees, especially in case of crisis when there is a high level of unemployment. Despite the fact that many people believe businesses should hire employees for their entire lives, I support the idea that (it) this is harmful and unprofitable for companies. 

Proponents of entire life employment consider that people should have a job security. Of course, they should but the example of the USA ( profits of its companies are the highest in the World) proves another thing: the system of strict monitoring (with exercising increased control over employees) and bonuses stimulates the productivity. When a person is sure about his/her future, he/she is not eager to self-development and has virtually no competition, let alone the fact that he/she (is) late at work and that is not for a company advance. Among other things, it hurts society because the quality of work is lower. Truth be told, with job security people care about their qualification less than those who must always prove to a company that it is needed in them and who are chastised more. 

Proponents also maintain that without job security people can have problems with employment because their professions are non-demanded. It can be, but sometimes a company  feels compelled to do it because if a company doesn't dismiss some people in order to cut its costs it will be in the recession and it is fairly obvious that more people will lose their jobs. Financially speaking, for the overwhelming majority of the companies it is unprofitable. There is no denying that businesses need more new, modern, talented, ambitious people because still its primary goal is maximizing its profits.
