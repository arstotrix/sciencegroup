Dear Alicia,
I have recently sent you an e-mail, informing about the approval of your candidature and offering you a job in our company. Unfortunately, the circumstances have changed: budget cutbacks don’t allow us to hire a full-time assistant. I deeply regret this and apologize to you for this situation. Still, it may change in the next few months, which will make it possible to engage you: you are an ideal person for the job, having excellent qualifications and experience we require. Unfortunately, I can’t make any promises for sure, but I hope for the best.
I would like to wish you success with you job search and future career!
Best wishes,
Mary Potapova.
Human Resources Manager
