Dear Ms Lawrence
I am writing to inform you to make a compliant related to your companyâ€™s professional performance and to cancel the purchase ordered on 15 July. We were dissatisfied with your failure to meet the deadline in 4 months period and, moreover, with the fact that only 100 items out of 1000 were delivered in spite of the fact that your managers promised to realize our order in time.
Due to this we faced a number of problems while running our show and lost the opportunity to make contacts and communicate with influential potential investors and important customers, which could affect our business significantly and give more opportunities to develop.
One more unpleasant detail occurred when we got the paperwork for the order and the packing list that came with the delivery. These documents specified the full range of ordered items, although, we got only 10% of them even several weeks later we did not receive the other part of the order. We are hoping that you will correct the error as we have decided to cancel the order.
Under these circumstances we are considering you to refund our payment. Hope to see your response as soon as possible.
Best regards,
Mary Potapova.
