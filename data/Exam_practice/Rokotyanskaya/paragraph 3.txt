Playing golf and playing tennis are rather different experiences. First of all, they are played on
different areas. While tennis is played on a court with a net, golf does not require a standardised
playing area. Instead, it is played outdoors on a huge golf course. Another difference concerns a
number of players. In tennis there is usually one pair of competitors, in contrast, more than two
people can participate in a game of golf. Furthermore, although tennis and golf are both ball sports,
equipment used to hit a ball differs. Tennis players use a racquet to strike a ball over a net, on
the other hand, golf players hit a ball with a club into a hole. It is also significant to mention that
the golf is much more expensive to play than tennis, however, the number of spectators of golf is
less than that of tennis. Finally, you need different physical skills to become a good tennis or golf
player. In tennis speed is very important, in golf, though, accuracy is much more essential.
