Date: 30 July
Subject: Final payment reminder

Dear Mr Bryson

I am writing to inform you that, despite earlier requests for payment, invoices no. BJ1728 for 2,915, dated 13 June, and BJ1735 for 2,670, dated 22 June, remain unpaid. Please find attached copies of the invoices for your information. As you know, our agreed payment terms are 30 days from date of invoice.
In view of our good commercial relationship in the past, we would like to resolve this matter amicably. We ask that you settle this account within five working days. In the event that you have already paid these invoices, please ignore this reminder.
If there is a problem with our goods which caused you to withhold payment, please contact me immediately at the telephone number below, so that we can resolve the issue.
Should you fail to pay this invoice by the stated date, then we may have no alternative but to review your account with us, which means that we will no longer be able to supply your company with our jewellery.

Best regards,
