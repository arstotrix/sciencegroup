National security is more important than our privacy

Jonathan Franzen claims that “Without privacy there was no point in being an individual”.  However, what criteria do we use to distinguish our personal life from actions, which affect other people? National security means protection of interests of all the citizens, although this would cost our privacy.

Much of the discussion and debate over privacy can be narrowed down to one famous quote: “Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?”   In essence, there is only one question: what do you want to hide? Your love relations or illegal drug chains, your personal fears or upcoming terrorist attack? The major point here is that national security has no interest in your personal life. The watchdogs do not care about your relations, if you are not a terrorist. The idea is to check is everything OK, and if not – protect us. On the other side, the issue is much more difficult. In ideal situation here are no contradictions: national security protects social interests, and you are a part of this society. However, some citizens of African countries and some others are not so lucky with their country interests. Nonetheless, it is another topic and let’s just remember that we are happy to live in Russia. 

Another argument is coming from young people who are eager to be free and live in one global community. They do hesitate, whether we really need national security to exist? Yes, we extremely need to think about our national interests. As the saying goes, if you wish peace, prepare for war. Today we should not only have strong military defense, but we should protect our motherland in informational wars. 

To sum up, national security provides us an opportunity to be protected; however we should pay our privacy for it. Nevertheless, life without fears gives more freedom to express your personality.
