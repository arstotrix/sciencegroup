Death penalty should be introduced in all US states

Nowadays people debate the issue of death penalty numerous times for multiple reasons. Some of them believe that death penalty reduces the amount of murders, calms down  family and society and it is not cruel. In any case, the court shall sentence and we should not forget that the main aim of our justice systems is correctional education, not a desire for retribution.

First of all, supporters of death penalty think that if there is such severe penalty for murders and other crimes in all US states it will decline number of senseless and pointless killing because offender will know they cannot escape punishment and likely will not do it. However, if he  commits crimes he would be killed but it does not make sense because the law breaker cannot realize his guilt. Thus opponents of death penalty insist on life imprisonment because it rehabilitates a person.  

Secondly, supporters also maintain death penalty because it helps relatives to cope with loss and feel relief. Nevertheless the death of murder cannot return the man to life. So, opponents think that killing of offender is insufficient punishment. The life in prison without parole is more severe and right decision for such immoral act.

Finally, supporters think that death penalty is less cruel and more human sentence than life imprisonment. In the US, there are five legal methods of execution: lethal injection, electrocution, firing squad, hanging, and gassing. These are fast and painless deaths. However, they all run the risk of accidents and sometimes people have great pain that is impossible to determine.

In conclusion it should be said that the aim of criminalâ€™s punishment is rehabilitation of a person and it can be done (by) life imprisonment. Moreover, it is more severe and more human because it gives person the time for thinking and does not hurt him.
