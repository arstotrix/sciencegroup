Dear Ms. Lawrence,
Our companies have collaborated on mutually beneficial basis for a long period, however the recent incident, when you failed to perform the contract, made us frustrated. On 15 July our company ordered you to provide 1000 promotional giveaway bags by 26 October, but we received only 100 of them on 17 November alongside with the assurance that the rest would be delivered by 20 November, when they were supposed to be given away. Nevertheless, we never heard from you since then, the lack was not supplied. Because of this fact we did not manage to make contact and communicate with important customers, which could affect our business. However the paperwork for the order and the packing list that came with the delivery specified 1000 rather than 100 bags and our accountant has provided the payment, because we regarded the delay as a pity accident. Considering the information provided, we would like you to refund the whole payment of our company, as the harm, which our company sustained from your failure is far larger, than the cost of the 100 bags delivered. If you ignore our demand, we will have to bid for an arbitrage.
Hope for your understanding.
Yours sincerely,
Ivan Vasyliev
Purchasing Manager
