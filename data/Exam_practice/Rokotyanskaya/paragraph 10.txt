Poverty is a disability of groups of individuals to satisfy the basic needs of human being. To identify the causes of this phenomenon in every concrete situation we should look at the actions of the government, specificity of the mentality and some unpredicted factors like nature interference into social life. Still the last group is not effective in describing the case of ours as far as our interests lay in the area of problems in Russia, where the number of people over the poverty line is 12,5 millions.

So, the mentality is one of the reasons of poverty in Russia. A wish to have everything by doing nothing causes the unability to work properly. And this finds its effects not only in the profit of a concrete person, but in the whole quality of production and successfulness of the Russian economics. Moreover those effects generate a chain of consequences which expresses in even less working capacity. Poor living conditions, absence of sufficient amount of food, problems with buying medecine destroy the vital energy of a person.

The government reaction is also what is important. But nowdays approximately 10-15 percent of people in Russia have an income less then a living wage.

Finally, there exist such a factor like an alcohol abuse which is the result of the depression, caused by failures in social life.
