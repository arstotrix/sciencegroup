Report
Executive	summary
								
Working	in	dangerous	places	presumes	extra	risks,	especially,	when	the	business	operates	
nearby	the	Favelas.		This	report	will	re=lect	the	current	situation	in	the	region	and	provide	a	
hard-line	solution.
Introduction
This	report	will	look	at
• crime	statistics	and	details	in	the	region
• 	calculation	of	costs
Findings
1. Crime	rates	
1.1.the	violent	crime	rate	increased	by	20%	over	the	last	year	in	the	region
1.2. the	number	of	kidnapping	cases	also	increased	from	29	in	previous	year	to	42	in	
the	last	year
1.3. key	targets	for	kidnapping	are	wealthy	businesspeople	and	their	families	(55%	of	
all	kidnapping	cases)
2. Kidnapping	details
2.1. usually	the	criminals	attack	cars	and	kill	the	driver	to	hostage	the	passenger
2.2. payments	to	release	the	victims	often	outshine	$1	million
2.3. 	11	victims	of	kidnapping	were	killed
Conclusion
According	to	statistics,	there	is	an	urgent	need	to	provide	extra	security	for	senior	
managers	and	their	families	as	they	might	be	the	key	target	for	the	kidnappers.	As	the	
criminals	act	mostly	by	hi-jacking	the	cars,	there	is	a	vivid	solution.
Recommendations
The Company	should	provide	bullet-prof	cars	for	all	senior	managers	in	order	to	minimize	
the	risks.	The	cost	of	one	such	security	car	is	approximately	$90,000.	Taking	into	account	6	
senior	managers,	the	total	expenditure	would	be	$540,000.	Of	course,	it	is	not	cheap,	
however	it	is	two	times	less	than	usual	payment	to	release.	Moreover,	there	is	a	chance	to	
receive	a	discount	for	6	cars	in	one	order.
