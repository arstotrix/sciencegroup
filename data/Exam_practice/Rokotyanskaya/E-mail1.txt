Dear Alicia
I am writing to inform you about decision of the companyâ€™s Board of directors on the issue of hiring full-time assistant, the post offered to you. Unfortunately, we cannot approve your candidacy as we will close this post now due to decision based on our budget policy. However, it could be a temporary measure, and if the situation changes we would be glad to hire you.
I will keep you informed about the situation and let you know in case of changes. Nevertheless, I cannot promise that we would be able to open this post in near future.
I am very sorry for any inconveniences caused. I wish you sincerely success in work search and career.
Thank you in advance for your understanding in this matter.
Best regards,
Mary Potapova.
Human Resources Manager
