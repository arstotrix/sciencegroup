Dear Mr. Blackwell,

We feel sorry about a terrible mistake, which our team has made. As for the delay of the payment, it was committed by the accountant of Display Graphics on 5 May. Having received the reminder on 7 May, I redirected it to the accountant, who assured me, that the repay had been completed, so we believed that some temporary delays between the banks occurred. I admit that we should have got in touch with you to resolve the issue. I delegated this issue to a new assistant, as it seemed to me easy to tackle, but today I found out that he has failed to do this task and he has already undergone punishment. As for the payment, I have just called the manager of the bank, who admitted that there were some problems with software on 5 May, so the repay was not delivered to your account. You can find the official apologize by the bank enclosed. The bank manager reassured me that he already ordered to tackle this awkward issue. If your account will not be credited by 20 May, please get in touch with me once again, because our company values the trust between Sigma Office Solutions and Display Graphics International, and we will do our utmost to prevent any kind of misunderstandings in the future.

Please accept our apologies.

Yours sincerely,

E. Lonza

Purchasing Manager
