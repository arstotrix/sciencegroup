SECURITY CONCERNS REPORT

Introduction

The life of executive officers within the South America subsidiary tends to be under threat due to an increased criminal activity rate. Consequently, the company should ensure their security.

Findings

Last year, a dramatic rise of 20% was observed regarding violent crime in the area. This holds true for kidnapping as well: for example, last year 42 cases were reported, in comparison to 29 incidents in previous year. In this light, our particular concerns about senior managers' security are backed by statistics. To illustrate, wealthy individuals and top executives are considered key targets for criminals: 55% of kidnappings involved business people and their family members.

Recommendation

Given the fact that the majority of kidnappings were committed by gunmen and even resulted in 11 deaths, we strongly recommend to provide six superiors with bullet-proof security cars. The price of a single security car makes up $ 90,000, which is considerably cheaper than making an average payment of $1 million to save a hostage. Thus, if the company procured these cars for its managers, it would be a step forward towards corporate responsibility to its human resources and a valuable element within its reputation management.
