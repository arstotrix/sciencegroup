Nowadays more and more new words appear every day. That is why, it is a common question what words could be considered as real. For almost all of us a real word is the word appeared in a dictionary. So, how could words enter it?
One of the ways a word becomes real is when lots of people say it. The usage of the word determines its “reality”. People working with dictionaries and languages listen to what is said, how it is said and how many times it is said. And after that due to statistics they can decide whether a word should be included into a dictionary or not. However, this choice must be taken not because of attitude but the data.
Words also can appear if dictionary editors vote for it. They have this right to decide but again they do it if know that the word is frequently used at that period and, that is why, should become real. 
Sometimes not only does a new word appear but also  real word changes its meaning. In this case dictionary editors try to explain the meaning of a word or its usage by providing so called “usage notes”. 
All in all, we should admit that a language changes. So, there will always be something new. And even if we don't like some changes, soon they can become common. That is why, accepting the change of a language, we allow it to develop.
