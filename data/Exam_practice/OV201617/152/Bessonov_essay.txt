Lots of new words appear in English language annually. They may be special for one group of people, some professional terms (biologic, chemical, physics etc.); or they can be used by the majority of the speakers. The second type nowadays appears because of the Internet and social network distribution. Some words become widely used because they refer to the actions we often do, like “tweet”, “defriend” and “selfie”. These words should enter dictionaries, because Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have become an integral part of the society. Some words, or, better say, abbreviations, like “lol” – “laugh out loud”, “tbh” – “to be honest” become very widespread in written messages, and, with special tags, should be included into the dictionaries. Also, corpora can be very useful in defining the frequency of using the word, but mostly in written sources, because speaking corpora usually have less entries. So, we should remember, that language changes permanently, and is created not by linguists, but by the speakers.
