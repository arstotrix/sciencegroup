In the era of rapid development of the surrounding world, it is difficult to imagine that language, the instrument of human interaction and communication, may be remained unchanged. Our vocabulary is constantly growing, becoming more colorful and more diverse. Sometimes new words are worthy of becoming a part of dictionaries. But how do these words appear there?
	Firstly, for a word to enter a dictionary, it must be seen to be used, and widely. But editors of the dictionaries are very selective in relation to the words claiming to be decided on. For example, lots of linguists go every to the American Dialect Society Annual meeting and vote for the word of the year to bring it into the dictionary. In the past, some of the winners have been "tweet" in 2009 and "hashtag" in 2012. "Chad" was the word of the year in the year 2000 and "WMD" in 2002.
	Secondly, the dictionary editors monitor what we say and how we write and try to predict, if a word assimilate into our everyday life, and in this case, add it to a dictionary. But they do it very carefully, because the word can only be fashionable temporarily. These include, for example, the abbreviation YOLO (You Only Live Once).	
To conclude, dictionaries are excellent sources of information, the appeal to which increases our culture of speech. Why does the word get into the dictionary? Because we use the word and continue to use it, and the dictionary editors watch this.
