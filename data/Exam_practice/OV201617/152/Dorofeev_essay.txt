Nowadays there are lots and lots of words that appear every day. Many of them are not enlisted in dictionaries because lexicographers don’t treat them as important. But should we do compile dictionaries in that way? 
Erin McKean, who is a professional lexicographer, believes that no words should be considered good nor bad. She argues that it is an obsolete way of choosing words that was widespread in the nineteenth century. To compile a dictionary of the new format, we need to consider all the new technologies that are available today. 
For instance, online-dictionaries may be useful. Online dictionaries are often compiled with the help of amateurs and there can be found words that are not enlisted in the classical dictionaries. Although these «hidden» words are widely used in colloquial speech, they are barely described. I believe we should treat them as all the other words because they are part of the language that is being used everyday.
As we pointed out, every word is important. That is why, we should compile a dictionary that will stand for the language, not for some part of it. This became possible now. An online dictionary can contain more words than any of printed dictionaries ever created taken together. 
So, I believe the best way for new words to enter dictionaries of English is to make one vast dictionary of English online. With the help of computer technology anyone can contribute. The online dictionary would be more quick, intuitive and comprehensive way of searching words than ever before.
