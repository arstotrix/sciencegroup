It is a well-known fact that the world changes constantly and the language is not an exception. The main controversial issue today is concerning the words that should be in dictionaries and the words that should be banned from dictionaries completely. In my opinion, not many people know how new words enter such magnificent books. The first step is very simple. People help word to become real by using it in their lives through the conversations, letters, social networks, e-mails and e.t.c. For instance, the word «lol» became popular with the invention of MySpace. Nowadays we use that word to refer to something funny. Undoubtedly, the word seems dull to some people nevertheless it seems impossible today to imagine our speech without using such word. Moreover, there is American Dialect Society annual meeting where 200 or 300 people, including famous American linguists, vote on the word of the year. For example, in the past, some of the winners have been "tweet" in 2009 and "hashtag" in 2012. I suppose it gives the certain word a great recognition. Being noticeable and widely used is a key element for word to be in a dictionary. I reckon that open-minded linguists and scientists are the reason why there are so many dictionaries today and so many words are in them. In the past people definitely used strict criteria and it certainly seemed that the language wouldn’t have changed at all. They put barriers because of their attitude towards the certain words. Summing up, I would like to say that the ability to understand changes in the language and to accept it as part of the language history is essential todays. It is the engine of the progress.
