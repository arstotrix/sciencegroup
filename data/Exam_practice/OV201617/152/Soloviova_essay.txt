That is common knowledge that the English language in all its forms has changed drastically throughout the years and is definitely not going to stop modifying. In a related move a huge amount of new words appear, so the linguists and the dictionary writers’ job becomes more and more complicated.
The new words need to be sorted out  by the frequency of their usage and accordingly added to the online or paper dictionaries. Firstly, if we discuss how a new word could enter the dictionary, we should realize who does normally decide to include a word into a dictionary or not. According to Anne Curzan’s speech, it is only up to the speakers of the language,so such words as “defriend” appears. She explains: “ It gets in because we use it and we keep using it, and dictionary editors are paying attention to us.” Moreover, she introduced such a term as “a real” word, a word which does not certainly appear in a dictionary, but is simply clear to the  great number of speakers. “If a community of speakers is using a word and knows what it means, it's real.”- that’s what she says. Secondly, she points out,that there is the other way for a word to appear in the dictionary. There is a special event – The meeting of the American Dialect Society, where the dictionary editors and linguists vote for the word of the year, so the word that wins probably will appear in the dictionaries soon.
To sum it all up somehow, I would like to mention, that nowadays while the language is changing every single day, we should be afraid of the fact,that a lot of new words appear in the dictionaries, it only means that it is developing. And all of these word should have a chance to appear in the dictionaries.
