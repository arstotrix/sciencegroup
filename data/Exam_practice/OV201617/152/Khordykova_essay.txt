For many people a real word is a word that appears in a standard dictionary. Dictionaries are fantastic resources, but they are human and they are not timeless. But how to keep up with people who use more and more new words in their speech and collect them for the dictionary? Actually, there is a variety of ways to do it. Firstly, the US’s most famous linguists go to the American Dialect Society annual meeting, where among other things, they vote on the word of the year. Other categories include “Most creative word of the year”, for instance.
Secondly, a word gets in a dictionary simply because we keep using it and editors are paying attention to us.
So, while being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction, love is what makes things real. If you love it, use it.
