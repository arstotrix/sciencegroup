Although not all people are satisfied that there are more and more slang words in people’s daily language, we cannot deny or reverse the fact that English vocabulary is enlarging rapidly. 
Now let us try to take a look at how the word can appear in the modern dictionary. One of the reason is the development of the Internet, which generates diverse words describing phenomena connected with the Internet (“to defriend”, “selfie”), which people are getting used to. That words become an important and large part of our everyday speech, so that linguists cannot ignore them without classifying them somehow. Another – and pretty amusing – way for words to get into dictionary is change of their first definition. They lose their primary meaning (e.g. the word “peruse” which has long meant “to read carefully”), and then, when the words frequency according to their connotations grows, linguists register it. Another way is to compile lists of “the most banished words” or to choose the “most popular word” – these lists transparently show the tendency of using some new-appeared or slang words. But the main mechanism is of course the fact showing how many people (and how often) use this of that word. It can be easily traced through Google books. 
The thing is that linguists should step back from their own preferences in order to compile the dictionary which shows how frequently is the word really used – because it is not linguists but speakers who shape the language.
