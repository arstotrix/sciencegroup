There is little doubt that all languages undergo changes especially nowadays and English is not an exception. Every year many new different words appear or the mean of old ones change. To use them correctly we need to have these words in dictionary, but not all them are recognized as official and are not added into dictionaries. So, what are the ways for new words to enter dictionaries of English at the beginning of 21st century?
Firstly, people should use the words which are new, slang or with changed meaning. The words which are often used by the vast majority of the speakers are considered to be alive. Thus, specialists who work with editing dictionaries may conduct a scientific research and find out that some words, probably, need to be added to the dictionary because they are in a high usage among speakers. 
Secondly, not all words are worth adding to dictionaries because some of them could be just a trend of time. Therefore, it could be better to organize some events which will be able to conduct, for instance, a ballot (for anyone who would like to take a part in it), in which the most useful new and slang words will be selected. That way it will be easier to weed out unnecessary words. 
Finally, we all should not be afraid of language changes, because our likes and dislikes are the main reason of slowing the development of language.
To sum up, dictionaries are wonderful sources of our vocabulary development. If we do not develop the lexicon of dictionaries, we will not be able to speak the language according to modern time or culture of languages including English.
