Nowadays dictionaries include many words and we don’t even know all of them. Speaking about online English dictionaries, their vocabulary according to the statistics continues to update every 98 minutes. The question is how new English words enter dictionaries today and become an integral part of the language. In my opinion, there are two main ways of the appearance of words.  
Firstly, social-networking sites affect positively English vocabulary because their compilers create words to name the functions of their sites. Consequently, site visitors begin to use them in their speech and share these words with others. Take the word “defriend” from FB for example that means to remove from friends and well-known words such as tweet, mail, chad and hashtag. Secondly, youth slang, formed casually in communication with friends and classmates, is worth mentioning. For instance, the word “hangry” made from “hungry” and “angry” and the word “adorkable” created from “adorable” and “dorky” sound fantastic. What’s more, youth slang also contains fashionable words like famous “LOL” and “YOLO” (you only live once).
In conclusion, I’d like to note that certainly not all words get accustomed to the English language but new ones replace them. Updating of language and dictionaries happens constantly.
