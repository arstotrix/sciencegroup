People used to perceive dictionaries as a covered pile of rules about words: how to use them, what do they mean, and, the most important point, which words are appropriate. They do not contemplate the question of who composed the dictionary. And this leads to misunderstanding in some points about language.
People are considered about new words appearing in dictionaries. They feel strange about accepting “invite” as a noun or “impact” as a verb. They feel suspicious about slang words like “LOL” or “defriend” to be in dictionaries. But, actually, a few years ago there appeared “google” as a verb and a prefix “e-“. And earlier people had argued about words like “colonize” and “reliable”, stresses in “bAlcony” and “cOntemplate”. Today all those words are appropriate and understandable for us. So we needn’t fear changes in language because they’re normal.
Dictionaries are reflections of our speech. Lexicographers could also not approve some new words, but they need to step aside from their preferences: the main point in picking up words is their usage. If an abundant amount of people use “impactful” and understand it’s meaning – so be it. Some words could change their meaning and a lexicographer needs to describe this change also. So the dictionary is not a constitution, it’s a mirror.
Languages tend to change and if the change is remarkable, it should be in a dictionary. We are not just the readers, we are co-authors. And the creativity of the author isn’t something to be afraid of.
