In modern world the developing of language is closely connected with the using of the Internet, especially different social networks, where we can notice a lot of new words such as "hangry", "adorkable", "LOL", etc. These words should be included in dictionaries just because they are widely-spread and this is a kind of representation of language culture. To include new words in dictionary, first of all, we should be convinced that most of the people are aware of the meaning of suggested word. By means of this social research we can form the statistics about frequency of word using. It will be beneficial for language corpora. Secondly, it is necessary to appeal to language authorities - writers, journalists, teachers - all the figures who compose dictionaries. Coming to the conclusion, I'd like to say that there is no problem that language changes rather quickly. People should accept these changes more easily, because they exactly create new words.
