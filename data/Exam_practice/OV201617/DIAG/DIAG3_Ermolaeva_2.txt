It goes without saying that the behavior of a child changes with growing of them. Some children change a bit, while others absolutely reverse. 
First of all, while the child grows up, he or she learns how to communicate not only with their peers, but also with older people. Actually, a small child would rather speak with someone older, but at school or at University they learn how to communicate with their teachers and tutors, even debate with them or create something together, i.e. work in one team. Secondly, the process of growing is accompanied by the understanding of courtesy rules. In fact, those who are 1-5 years-old do not know what is good and what is bad, but reaching the certain age they definitely understand how to behave in a society. Unfortunately, the opposite process can also take place, as some of us become rude and tough under the influence of big cities and hectic lifestyle. 
To sum up, I strongly believe that we gain experience, learn from it and become worse or better on the whole duration of our life. And these changes that happen with us can be either good or bad, as it can be seen from previous examples. It all depends on the concrete person. If somebody wants to be related as someone rude and unpleasant, they could be so or change to the better side.
