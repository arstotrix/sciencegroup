The diagram below illustrates the process of leather goods production. It shows how the leather changes from pure animal skin into bags, shoes and balls. 
The first step is to make the animal skin dry, so that it could be transported to the factory. At the factory the animal skin is washed in lime water. It remains in water for some time and soaks lime juice. After that the leather is flattened with special equipment. Next the leather is pulled into container with tannin, where it soaks the vegetable matter. The final step is the polishing of leather, which is necessary to make leather appropriate for cutting. 
Eventually, the leather is delivered to another factory, where the leather goods will be made. Clearly, without !! of animal skin it would be impossible to produce any leather goods, because after it animal skin becomes harder and than it was before.
