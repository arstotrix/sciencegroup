It is obvious that nowadays your job can give you a pleasure or a good salary, but - in most cases - not both of it at the same time. In my opinion, the enjoyable job is much better, but other people argue that earninig good money is more important.

Firstly, I would like to emphasize that when you love your job you gave better results. You work more effective and succesful, when you are interested in what you are doing. If you are keen on your job, you can also develop your personal skills in this field. Moreover, with loveless, unenjoyable job you could get depression and other problems with mind health. You will get a lot of money but be in the doldrums and have low self-respect, self-concept and self-confidence. Finally and generally, the word "money" doesn't mean "happiness" at all. To be happy at least in one field of life - at work - is much more important that great amounts of money (according to a number of great philosophers).

On the other hand, job isn't a hobby. It has always been mainly considered just as a source of money for surviving. Secondly, for being enthusiastic at your work you should have material well-being. You should care about your food, your health, etc. and it all requires money so job has to provide you with money. Thirdly, for many people job isn't the most important part of their life. They may have families, studying, friends and hobbies. Thus their job may be just a way to survive and earn money for all this and isn't expected to bring pleasure.

To conclude, I would like to say that this problem is a very individual problem. For me a convinced way to solve it is to find a compromiss between pleasure from my job and salary I get there.
