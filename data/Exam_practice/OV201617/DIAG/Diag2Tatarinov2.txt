On my personal opinion it is controversial question. It is very hard to decide what is better. To have a lot of money but no pleasure or a lot of enjoyment without money.
At first, lets describe variant with a big earnings. Everyone know that when you have a lot of money, you can buy anything or you can travel a lot. So money open the way to the great amusement. So it is looks like it is not so bad to have a job with a big wage but without enjoy. On the other hand it is very hard to work on such job so there is no guarantees that you will be able to work on such job for a long time. This may cause to sad circumstances like depression. In this situation all earned money are useless.
Now let's talk about another type of job where you have very low salary but you enjoy every day doing you job. The positive side of this situation is that you will never get tired. Everyday you will fell a new flow of energy. No bad mood or depression will violate your life. But, not excluded that you will not be able have a car or good flat. And of course, you will not be to travel somewhere because all you money will be spent on food and necessary payments.
All in all i want to say that both of this types are bad. It is much better to have a enjoyable job with big salary! Of course such a job is looks like utopia or never-never so it is somehow not bad to have a job with plane salary and middle level of enjoyable. But if i had to choose between high wages or high delight level, i'd choose high wages because i believe that money can make people happy if spend it wisely.
