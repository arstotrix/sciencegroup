The diagram presented below shows how leather goods are being produced. The animal skin is being transformed in several ways. but most of the time it soaks and flattens.
First of all, after the skin is dried in the air, it is transported to the factory that makes leather. There, the skin is washed in a mix of water and lime. Later on, it soaks in lime. Having soaked for some time, it is flattened. Now it finally resembles the leather we see on the wallets, etc., but there are some stages to go through. After the flattening, the skin soaks again â€” now in a mix of water and vegetable matter. so the water mixtures are not confused. After the second soaking, the skin is being polished. After that, the ready product, the leather, is carried to another factory, where leather goods are being produced.
