The graphs in the task compare the percentage of international tourists, who arrived into different regions from 1990 to 2005, a period of 15 years.
At the first glance, the arrivals in every part of the word had steady upward trend over the period. 
The difference is in the intensity of the increase.
The most significant number of arrivals had North America, where it increased from 70 million to the highest point at 90 which exceeded that of the other countries, with the exception of Central and Eastern Europe that had the same highest point in 2005. 
While Central and Eastern Europe had a surge throughout the period, the percentage of arrivals in other parts increased gradually.
With regard to Sub-Saharan Africa and South America, there was a rise throughout the period with starting at the same point at 10 and finishing at 15 and 20 million respectively. 
At the point where the increase of arrivals in Sub-Saharan Africa finished in 2005, rise of arriving people in South-East Asia started in 1990 and proceeded until 2005.
To conclude, it can be seen that the increase of international tourist arrivals in different parts of the world was not equal.
