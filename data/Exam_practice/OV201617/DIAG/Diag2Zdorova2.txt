Job takes a significant place in people's life, and they used to argue about this topic. According to ones,  it is better to love your job, but do not earn  a lot of money. Others are concerned that a good salary is the most important thing, when you think about job. It is a very controversial question, because all sides have their advantages and disadvantages.
As i mentioned before, job is the most significant thing in your life. When you really love the place where you are working, your job becomes a challenging task for you and you do it in a better way than others. Moreover, you do not have a risk to earn a stress connected with non-enjoyable job. However, you probably do not have a lot of money.
There is no such problem when you work at well-paid job which you do not like. Firstly, you can easily buy things and there will be never a question about money. Furthermore, money gives you an opportunity to relax well and to travel a lot, for instance. On the other hand, the more you spend your nerves and, definitely, your health on a job like that, the  more relax you need. 
Of course, the best decision you can make is to find a lovely job with a good salary, but it is very hard. In my opinion, job is not always about money. It is more important to feel well and be in harmony with yourself, than to be a languid and rich person.
Generally, although a well-paid job gives your more opportunities, it is better to work when you enjoy what you do.
