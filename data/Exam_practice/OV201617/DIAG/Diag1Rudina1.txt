The picture presents 2 figures showing the percentage of income spent by people from the USA and the  UK on petrol.
Overall, the graph distinguished people from each country into 3 groups (according to their salary): the poorest people, citizens with middle income and the richest.
To begin with, people with the lowest income in the USA spend the greatest part of their salary on petrol, compared to the UK, where the expenses on a fuel among the poorest are extremely low. We can assume that such people just do not have cars. The figure of the USA reaches its peak at the level of above 5% in the middle of the group of the lowest-income-people, whereas it starts to decline slightly and reaches its minimum near the top of the richest Americans (about 2.5%). As for the UK, the line presents a completely different situation: the figure always increases and at the level of the middle-income it does not show any significant changes at all. It reaches a peak among the richest people (about 4%) and after it plummits all its way. This fact proves: the more the British people earn, the more they spend on petrol, which presents a direct correlation between salary and owning a car. 
As two coutries show 2 opposite models of income management, two lines intersect at the boarder between middle-income and the richest, the percentage at that point amounts 4%.
To summarise, the movements of two lines as different as the relation between fuels and an income. In the USA the more a person earns, the less he or she spends on petrol. By contrast, in the UK the less a person earns, the less the probability that he or she is able to have a car and spend money on petrol.
