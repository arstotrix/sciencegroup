When children are growing up, they start to behave in a different way in comparison with the time when they are too young to learn what phrases or manners they should use in order to be polite within society. 
Generally speaking, when a person is a child, he or she is able to do the things that are not appropriate for adults. For instance, when a child is on a beach in summer, they can be without any clothes and no one is offended by that fact. More than that, it is normal for a child to play all day long because everyone thinks that they are developing their skills with the help of games. 
There is no denying that there is another situation with adults. When people are old enough, they are supposed to act more wisely. They are not supposed to do stupid things because they are taught to try being an idol for those who are younger. More than that, it is believed that a grown-up person should do just the right things. Otherwise, he or she often do not have the right to do a big failure. That is why adults have to be serious in everything that they are dealing with. 
In conclusion, at some point it is a little bit harder to act like an adult because the importance of every action is higher. People start to understand what  manners mean to people and begin to understand that we have to follow them in order to be polite  and intelligent.
