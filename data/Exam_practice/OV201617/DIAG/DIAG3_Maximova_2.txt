Time passes by, and children become adults. We greet some changes with warmth and refer to the others that they are a catastrophe. I believe that all these changes are for the good.
To begin with, we have to ask ourselves: what usually changes? I believe that the main thing that changes is the attitude to failures. They are nothing for a child, who will take part once again, but everything for an adult person, who may even fall into depression. Furthermore, the attitude towards parents is changing. Kids believe that parents will help them in any way possible, their authority is unbreakable. The adults, on the other hand, know that you cannot always rely on parents.
In general, I believe that this is a positive change. When we grow up, we become more independent. Some of our positions change, and it is perfectly normal! There is no child with a perception of the world of a 30-year-old person. It is really strange if the person does not change, because our life is all about change, and we have to react to the world, which is changing all the time.
Secondly, we have some expectations and standards for a specific age. We expect children and adults to behave in a very different way. As for children, we expect outgoingness, openness to the world, being sincere with everybody else. As for adults, we can think of having your own perception of the world and its problems, some seriousness, etc. If these expectations are not fulfilled, it will be much harder to communicate and distinguish people.
To sum up, changes in behaviour are usually for the good, so we would better help our children with accepting them.
