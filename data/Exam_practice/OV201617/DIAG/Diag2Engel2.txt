Many people say that the most important thing in life is to be happy. These people prefer to have a job that they like, even if it does not make that much money. However, some do not agree and think that earnings are way more important than happiness. 

The group of people who pick happiness with their job over money has a few very relatable reasons to do so. First of all, there are some non-material goods that people are keep searching for, no matter what. You cannot buy happiness and satisfaction, and these are two key elements of success. Second of all, liking what you do simply leads to liking yourself. Besides, being rich, but unhappy never ends well: there are countless illustrations of how successful people end their lives or mental health because they did not like what they were doing. 

Nevertheless, some adults think otherwise. Their reasons to do so are also quite understandable. Their version of happiness is connected with money: the richer they get, the happier they become. Also, some of them do not even understand how can you not like your job if it pays you off well. Finally, these people are probably sure that material products can always send unhappiness away, which is not always the case. 

Personally, I stand with people who assume that enjoyable job is way better than money, because good, steady self-esteem and happiness inside lead to great accomplishments. Afterall, every individual aspires to happiness, is it right?
