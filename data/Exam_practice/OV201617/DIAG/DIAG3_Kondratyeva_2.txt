When children grow up, their social behavior almost always changes in some ways. The question is, what are the main differences between children's and adults' social behavior and to what extent are these changes good?
In my opinion, the most significant difference is that children are more open and honest than adults. When you are a six-years-old, you are not afraid of saying everything that pops up to your mind, and it is absolutely normal. But when you are an adult, you need to control yourself, otherwise you might meet some serious problems. It seems to be a good change, but often it leads to horrible insincerity of grown-ups.
Another important difference is that children quite often do not think about consequences of their behavior, but when they grow up, they learn to care about it. For example, the said six-years-old can eat an ice cream on the street in winter, just because they want to, and an adult in the same situation will probably think about the risk of having a cold and not eat this ice cream. On the one hand, it is truly important to always think twice before doing something, but this quality makes a lot of adults quite boring people, who is unable to do something adventurous and unpredictable.
I believe that all these changes are good to some extent. Honesty and immediacy are nice qualities, but in some situations it is better to stay silent. And it is definitely better to seem a bit boring, but almost never fail, than behave like a man, who is afraid of nothing, but then suffer from consequences of rash decisions.
