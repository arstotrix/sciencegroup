Choosing a job is a hard decision to make: it is not so easy to start a career in a new sphere. So there is always a choice: to get a job in order to be well-paid or be a professional loving the things you work with. As far as I am concerned, it is better to choose an enjoyable job as I believe that the main people's life-goal is to be happy.

On the one hand, money is an important part of modern life as a lot of things depend on it. Firstly, if you are paid not enough money you can not afford some expensive (or even not so expensive) things you would like to buy. One can not, for instance, travel a lot, entertain him-/herself in a public places frequently or buy expensive presens for his/hers beloved ones. Secondly, a good salary is often considered as something prestigious and it is also believed that money can make a person more powerful. So it is true to some extend that a good salary leads to a better life so the main aim of working should be earning money.

However, this is not always like that as earning a lot of money doing something you hate to do does not lead to a better life at all. People can get depressed and loose will to do anything. Moreover, if you have passion for doing your job even if it does not bring you a lot of money you can make the word better and develop some new ideas in some spheres of your working interests. Finally, people doing things they love at work do not need as much time for hobbies and rest as those who do not like their work do.

To sum up, both jobs with good salaries and enjoyable ones have their advantages as the former could help you to afford more anf the latter brings you more joy and makes your life happier.
