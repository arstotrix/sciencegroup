Nowadays we are seeing an increase in a number of different jobs. But this takes us to the point where we have to decide whether or not it's worth having a job one doesn't like, but brings a lot of money, or, on the contrary, it's better to have a job that one likes, but gets small money for it. 

We can't deny the fact that having an enjoyable job brings less problems than having a lot of money. First of all, it's right to say that being pleased with a job is important for mental health. Being in good mood is very important for productivity and that's why a lot of employers take good care of their employees in terms of psychological support.
Second of all, for many people it's very important to feel that they belong to their workplace. It also means that workers would rather feel welcomed by their co-workers than envied by them. Most importantly, people love being useful instead of being well-paid. 

However, there are lots of people, who say that they prefer money over pleasure. For them being well-paid is more prestigious. It gives them opportunity to draw a lot of attention of others and be surrounded by top ranked people. Worth mentioning is the point that getting higher salary results in a better quality of life. This way people may spend more money on their wellness and improve home conditions. 

Nevertheless, this argument shows us that there will always be two arguing sides and it's hard to decide who's correct. For me personally it's very important to be satisfied with the work I do, but of course, I think that the labour should be paid accordingly to the amount of work done and its quality.
