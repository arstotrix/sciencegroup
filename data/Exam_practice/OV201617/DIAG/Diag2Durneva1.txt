The graph given in the task provides a visualization of figures describing international tourist arrivals North America, Central and Eastern Europe, South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and South America between 1990 and 2005.
As we can see, North America has been the most visited all along the decade, while South America and Sub-Saharan Africa have been the less visited. The trend of visits of North America, South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and South America have stayed stable and haven't been fluctuating a lot through time: the biggest number by which one of them raised is nearly 20 million. On the other hand, the trend of visits of Central and Eastern Europe raised dramatically by 60 million in 15 years.
As it can be seen on the graph, in the given period of time the most popular parts of the world among tourists have always been North America as well as Central and Eastern Europe. In the end of the graph the figures became equal at the point of nearly 90 million, while back in 1990 the number of tourist arrivals in North America was 40 million bigger than the number of tourist arrivals in Europe.
As for South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and South America, the number of tourist arrivals has not changed a lot through time. However, the figure raised by 15 million in South-East Asia from 2000 to 2005 while in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America in the same period  it raised nearly  just by 5 to 10.
