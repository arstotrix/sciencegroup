Every human being goes through different stages of his or her life: the childhood, the teenage years, the adulthood and the old age. Despite being the same person during all the stages, the individual shows very different social behaviors as a small child and as a mature adult. There are different opinions about this change. Some people suppose that this is good, others disagree.
In my opinion, the social behavior change is indeed for good. Firstly, we, humans, live in society with norms that were made by us in order to control the well-being of the society itself. A person learns these norms during his or her life. The little kids havenâ€™t learnt  what the rules are and how to follow them yet. That is why the behavior of a child is not always socially acceptable. Secondly, the small kids are not fully developed mentally. The development of some parts of human brain, like a frontal lobe, continues up to the age of twenty five. The young brain has not reached its full capacity yet, that is why it cannot perform in the same way as an adult brain can. That explains the difference in social behavior as well.
However, there is another point of view. Some people suggest that a lot of people lose the optimisms, which is so natural for little kids, during their lives, and it is a statement that is hard to argue with. The other argument is that with age people tend to become more and more conservative, whereas the small children are always open to something new.
All in all, there are different opinions about this problem. While some changes in social behavior are bad in some sense, there are definitely more good changes.
