The given diagram describes the process of preparing leather before producing leather goods.
Animal skin is left drying outside on fresh air.
Then it is transported to the factory, where the main process is going.
On the next stage workers wash the skin in water mixed with lime juice.
Cleaned material is placed in container with pure lime juice for soaking.
After a while two huge rollers make the skin flattened, whereat the process of soaking repeats.
However, this time solution, which calls tannin, contains water and vegetable matter.
Soaked skin needs to be polished before the transportation to the producing factory.
Many different things are made of leather, for example bags, shoes, balls for sport.
As we see, this process is not very complicated.
Even difficult stages of flattening and polishing, where special mechanisms are involved, can be done manually.
