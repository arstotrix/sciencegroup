The given diagram illustrates the stages of producing leather goods.
The main methodes which are used to make leather from animal skin are drying, washing, soaking, flattering and polishing. 
Firstly, the animal skin needs to be dried. Than the dried skin is transported to factory, where it is put to the solution of water and lime with the object of being washed. Later on, it is being soaked in lime, flattered and soaked for the second time in tannin. Finally, the soaked skin needs to be polished. After polising, it becomes leather, which means, that it is ready to be used in production of leather goods.
To make different leather objects (such as shoes, bags and balls), the leather needs to be transported to corresponding factories.
In conclusion, we can add, that the process of producing leather goods consists of two main parts. The first part is the processing of animal skin, so that it becomes leather.
The second part is making the resulting, terminal products from leather.
