Nowadays people often think about money, about their work and other things of that type. Even when children are in school adult sometimes ask them what profession they like and who they want to be in the future. Let us to see the different opinions about on this problem and try to look on some details of this problem.

Some people think that the main goal in the life is their salary. They think a lot about money and their job. They try to do all possible things for their future, even if they do not like these things and these things do not make them happy. From their point of view, money and comfort can provide a good, normal life. I think I know the one of them. He is on the beginning of their carrier of economic analytic. But he already told me, that he has understood, that he does not like the work for which he was preparing for several years. And he does not tend to change anything in his life.

But there is another type of people. They do only the things they like. It does not mean that they are lazy or infantile. It means that when they do something it is sure that they do it just for themselves and they do not think about the profit from this deal. These people often are in the art or in the science. Some of them do some simple work that make them pleasure, or work with children, or something like that. I think I know the guy of these type. He dances. He dances every day and he has a real pleasure from dancing. He teach other people dance but he can not do a lot of money from it. 

From my point of view we must not do the things only just for money. It can not do us  happy and this is can not be the main sense of our life. But if one do some activity that he realy love, I am sure, he will not with out the amount of money that is need for the life for him and his family. So this is a rather important topic for a discussion and for to think about.
