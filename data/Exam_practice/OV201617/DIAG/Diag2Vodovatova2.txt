Nowadays, in the world of media and the Internet, where everything has a certain price, the idea of a well-paid job is something a lot of people dream about. However, is being rich worth being stuck at an unloved job?
In my opinion, the most important thing in life is to be happy. When you are happy, the rest will come to you. I think when you love your job, you work hard and you can spend all of your free time doing some projects, working double shifts. Then of course your supervisor will notice your efforts and give you a promotion. That way you will climb a social ladder, gain more money and still get to do what you like. When you receive pleasure from your work, everything else falls into place. I cannot say that earning a lot of money is a bad thing, but you certainly do not have to stay somewhere where you may feel suffocated in a way. 
A lot of people say that money can buy happiness. They tend to argue that you do not have to love your job to be happy. You have your family, friend, your hobby to make you happy. Your job is just a source of money you need to make a living. If you have a good salary, then you can spoil yourself and that will bring you joy. While I agree to some extents with this opinion, I strongly believe that you do not need to torture yourself by being stuck at an unwanted job.
All in all, it is up to each one of us to decide what is important in life. As I said before, you can still be happy with your life even living with a low-income. You just have to believe in yourself and look forward to what the future may bring you.
