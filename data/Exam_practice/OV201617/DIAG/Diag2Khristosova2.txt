People care a lot about finding a right job. They want to enjoy them but also the main idea of all the jobs is earning money. But which of the factors is more important? It is a topic which causes many discussions.
There is a popular saying, 'Do what you like, like what you do'. It means that you should choose favourite activities in life to be happy, and if you do, you will always have a lot of enthusiasm towards them. People who ehjoy what they are doing perform better and achieve more - not because they need to, but because they work with passion and excitement. These people generally feel more content with their lives and value every moment of it.
On the other hand, the world is very materialistic. There isn't always a possibility to make your living doing a job that you enjoy. People worry about their financial situation and always try to improve it any way possible. In many cases they give up on the jobs they enjoy and replace them with the one that provides a better salary. It is true that the more money you have, the more doors open and the less you have to think about everyday needs, but it is easy to become unhappy if you have to spend the biggest part of your life doing things that are necessary, unpleasant and do not bring you any satisfaction.
My opinion on this controversial topic is that people should try to think less about increasing their income and focus on finding ways to do what they like for their living. The happier a person is, the less problems they have - people who enjoy life are usually healthier and everything comes to them with ease. Of course it's great when an enjoyable job also lets you make a lot of money, but it's hard to imagine that happening for everyone regarding the current situation in the world.
