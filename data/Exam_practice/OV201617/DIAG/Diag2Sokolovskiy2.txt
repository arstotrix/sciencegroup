Well, this is quite a personal thing and both opinions will die only with the humanity. It is easy to understand each of these points of view. For some people living in poverty is worse than doing what you don’t like. They are sure, that more money gives person more freedom and it’s OK to do some unpleasant job for future happiness. Others think different. People doing unpleasant job are wasting their time. Money bring no happiness, and the best way of living is doing what you like.

So let’s think what is better. I was always sure that enjoying the job is the most important thing in working. Getting more money doesn’t give more freedom, but makes you spend more and earn more again. The only way out of this circle is working for enjoyment. Having no car doesn’t mean having no happiness. And if you spend most of your time working, it is much better if you like the job.

However, when a person like me grows up, he may face real troubles. If this pleasant job doesn’t give enough money to feed your small baby, you should change the job. A similar problem appears in poor country where people chose not between pleasant or unpleasant job, but between life and death. Of course all of them are ready to work only for money without enjoying the process. Everyone would have chosen life instead of death.

So maybe when humanity will develop to the level, where no poverty exists, this dilemma will die, but now it has no correct answer.
