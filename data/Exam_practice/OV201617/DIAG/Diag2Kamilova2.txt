In modern world almost every person has a job to make his or her living. People have to work to earn money. They need it to survive.  Of course there are many examples of people who prefer illegal earnings such as robbery and so on. But now we talk about those who works.  The question is: should job be enjoyable?
Some people are sure that you need to like your job. Firstly, they say that if you hate the place you work at, you are not going to work there for a long time. People always get tired of what they do if the work do not bring them a pleasure. Secondly, if you cannot get enough money on your work for some reasons, at least you can enjoy it. And finally, these people are sure that you will avoid depression if your job will be on your taste.  You will wake up every morning with positive thoughts. 
However, there are people who think that it is important to earn a lot of money, no matter if you like your job or not. They are ready to spend all the time at work if this work is well-paid. Such people are sure that the more they earn the happier they will be. But they forget that in the end they do not have time to spend their money. Besides, these people want to earn a huge amount of money to give it to their children and grandchildren. 
Taking into consideration all mentioned above, I think that it is important to have a well-paid job. But you should remember that only money cannot make you happy. So it would be great if you can combine both money and pleasure in your work.
