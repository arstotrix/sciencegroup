We live in a world of opportunities. We can choose almost any career and do whatever we want for a living. The problem is that the most interesting jobs are not necessarily the well-paid ones. It means that sometimes we have to make a very difficult choice between pleasure and money. But what is better: enjoyable job and a lack of money or a good salary and boring everyday routine? 

Some people say that they will never do the work they are not interested in only because of a good salary, the others claim that money compensate everything, even the days, weeks and years full of hatred and frustration. On the one hand, doing something that you truly love and being really passionate about your job is the only one correct way to treat your life. If you spend the most part of your time on the things which make you depressed, you will never have enough energy to find, for example, a new hobby that will fill a hole in your soul. You will only complain and feel tired and money (even a huge amount of them) will never help you. On the other hand, you can get a lot of satisfaction from your job, but suffer from a lack of money and live somewhere near a railway station in a box (maybe even literally). And it may lead to the situation, when you will start to hate your job and hate yourself for choosing it.

In my opinion, people should try to choose not only a job they adore, but also a job they can do well enough and be prepared for constant self-development. Maybe I am too idealistic, but I believe that this is possible to have an enjoyable job and earn a lot of money at the same time, but it means that you should be a professional, develop your skills every single day and have enough patience to go through some hard days.

In conclusion I would like to say that it is always possible to find the golden mean and there are never only two binary options.
