Nowadays getting more and more popular different points of view on which aspect of job is more important. Some people prefer to have an enjoyable job while others say that it is better to have a job where they can earn much more money. 
On the one hand, if you have a job you like, it makes you feel better in aspects of humanity. For example, protecting environment is not supposed to bring you all money of the world. It is also possible, that if you are really good at something, someone may notice you and give you the job you like with high enough salary. In lots of programming companies workers are placed in comfortable atmosphere and surrounded by features which would make theirs work easier and more enjoyable. 
On the other hand, a good salary can also lead to life you want to live. Doing the job you may even hate, you can save some money to do the hobby you like. For example, if you love travelling it is not required that you work as a travel agent, but you might be top manager who has traveled the world in free time. Meanwhile doing the job you hate can lead to stress and even to problems with health. 
In conclusion, everyone has to answer this question for himself. However I believe that if you do the job you like, it brings you fame and money as much as you want.
