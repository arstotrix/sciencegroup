Nowadays when we look at our children or little brothers or sisters, we cannot imagine that we were just like them once. How do we change so much that it is difficult to relate to the young generation?
In my opinion, the main reason why we are so different is because these days children know a lot more about technology than we did when we were little. They are can turn on the cell phone when they do not know even how to walk. Children are so absorbed in their virtual reality, they do not even know how to socialize in a different way. Adults, however, were raised the other way and they are not so depended on technologies. They prefer to communicate in real life, face to face. 
Nevertheless, there are people who might argue that changes can be good. For example, children nowadays are more open-minded. They are open to new things. They have a lot of amazing opportunities that await them. Changes can be good, but unfortunately, what the youngsters tend to forget is the roots. The roots are very important. Family should be on the top of your priorities.
All in all, there are a lot of different thoughts on this topic. Personally, I believe that young children nowadays are very diverse and we cannot speak about them as a whole. They are very individual, unique. I think that we need to find a golden mean between changing everything and staying the same.
