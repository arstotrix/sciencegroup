For some people an enjoyable job is more important than a good salary, while the other are ready to do anything for a living to earn a big sum of money. 

To my mind, enjoying a process is more important than anything - than result or than the money, which you will earn. 
A man spends a lot of time, while working. We work 5 days a week - it is a lot. A happiness is the most important thing in life for me. 
If I can get some money, while enjoying the process of working. If these money are enough to pay a rent and to buy a food, I choose it. 


On the other hand, everyone needs money. There is a rule in a modern world, which says that money are necessary.
But there are many unpleasant high-payed jobs, where people are permanently sad and unhappy. For example, a job in an office. 
Sitting in front of the comuter, not talking to people and doing some paper stuff every day make people angry and sad. All they got from these job are negative emotions. 


A plan, when a man does something, what he or she likes when he or she gets a salary for this is a perfect one. 
In that case a person has the time of their life. But if there is no choise, undoubtedly, I choose the happiness during the process than a high salary.
