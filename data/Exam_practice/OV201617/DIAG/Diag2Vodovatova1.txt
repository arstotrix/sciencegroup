The chart below provides information about world-wide tourist arrivals in various parts of the planet. 
In 1990 the number of tourists who would arrive to North America was a little bit higher than 70 millions. This figure has changed a lot in 10 years, because in 2000 the number of tourists arrivals has reached 90 millions, which is the highest number for all of the continents. 
Significant breakthrough has happened in Central and Eastern Europe, where in 1990 only approximately 30 millions of tourists would visit this continent. However in 2005 the number has reached almost 90 millions of international tourist arrivals. This rapid growth means that conditions for tourists in countries on this continents have dramatically increased for the best.
In South-East Asia in 15 years the quantity of tourists arrivals has increased from 20 millions to 45. In Sub-Saharan Africa the change wasn't major, the number went from 10 millions of visitors to 20.
The least favourite continent for tourists to visit was South America, starting with only 10 millions of visitors and increasing by only 5 millions in 15 years.
