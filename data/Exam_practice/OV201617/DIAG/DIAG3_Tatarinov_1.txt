As we can see on the diagram there are many stages of producing leather goods. After we gets animal skin we dry it before delivering to the factory.
When dried animal skin is finally delivered to the factory, the stage of washing starts. Bur for this stage we use special mixture of water and lime. After that, animal skins transforms to the soaking stage, where we use lime only.
After soaking and washing stages, skin is ready for fluttering. There are many special flattering machines on the factory, that make skin ready for the next soaking stage.
On the second soaking stage we use the same process but another mixture. This time we mix water and vegetable mixture.
After second soaking stage, skin is ready for polishing that makes skin looks like a final material that factories use to make leather goods.
But before we have to delivery ready skin to the factory where all the leather goods born.
