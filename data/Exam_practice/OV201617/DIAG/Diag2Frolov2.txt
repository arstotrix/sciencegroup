There has been a dispute about what is better for comfortable living. Some people say that the most important thing is to have enjoyable job. Others think that it is better to have a job high payment. I will give my opinion on this topic.
Of course, both arguing sides have points that make a lot of sense, but I personally think that it is necessary to work in a place that you like and do things that you enjoy.
Firstly, there is no such rule that person can't earn enough money to provide him/herself with anything he/she wants choosing profession that he likes. Many artists or musicians are getting millons by selling their art or music albums. 
Secondly, it is not vital to be rich, if you want to be happy. There are people who live just to do things that they can do best or to help others. They are happy even if everyone else think that it is pointless and boring. There was a story about a japanese man who digged a tunnel through a mountain alone. He has spent a life on it and was happy, because he helped people. Even when he didn't get any money for this, he enjoyed his work.
There is no point if you spend your lifetime on things that you don't enjoy, because you may not have such opportunity later, when you become old or die. 
The only thing that makes everything unpleasant is that it is very hard to find both enjoyable job or earn lots of money.
All in all, it is personal choise to everyone how what path they want to choose for their future.
