There are always many discussions of what a job should be like. What is the main principle in a choice of a job? In this way of thinking appear such factors as a location of a job, human factor, social state, but all thinkings lead to the main two factors in the end. Some people say that the main thing is a satisfaction you get with a job, others claim that only a good salary matters and leads to a jouful life. I side with that ones who are for an enjoyable job.
Firstly, the biggest amount of time of their lifes people spend working. I do not think that it is worth to spend almost the whole your life on an unpleasant job or even hatred job. For example, my uncle Bob spent all his being a farmer, but dreaming of being an artist. But then unexpectably he got cancer and he was extremely unhappy because of he had unpleasant job. Secondy, in my opinion, if you are really into your job and do love it, you will reach a succes in your professional area and will get a good salary as a result. For example, my aunt Ginger is a musician and gets good money while performing, even though a profession of a musician is not beleived to be profitable.   
Other people think that pleasure is not the essential factor of job. They say that more joy you can get by having a good salary, and no matter how much you love your job.    
All in all, the choice of a job is an everyone's own buisness. It depends on ethical values and background, and many more important things. The main thing is you satisfied with your choice.
