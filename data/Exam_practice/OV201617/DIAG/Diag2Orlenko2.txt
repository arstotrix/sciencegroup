Nowadays, there are two opinions. Some people think that salary is important fact in a job selection while others believe that the most important thing is to have a job you love with all your heart.
On the one hand, it is true that if you earn a lot of money, you can buy anything you want. Therefore you will never be in need of something and you will be able to buy it. You will be able to buy the best car or to travel to every country which you want to. All this will help you to live a life that you want. Your life will be perfect except for one. More likely that your work will not bring you pleasure and you will always be dissatisfied with something. 
On the other hand, it is more important to do things that you love. You will take pleasure in their work, and you will not matter how much you earn. The most important thing that you can buy essintial things namely you can buy your own food or pay for accomodation. For example now, many parents think that their children should learn economic sciences. Whereas, their children want to be artists or actors and actresses. When children grow up and become those who they want, they enjoy their work and do not regret about their choices. Moreover, parents are happy for their children. 
To tell about my opinion I think that if you want to be an actor or actress you shouldn't ask somebody their opinion. If you feel that it is your real way and you will always be interested in job you choose, you should make a decision by yourself.
