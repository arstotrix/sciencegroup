Many people believe that children social behavior is changed eventually. It means, then children are growing up and become adults, their views and purposes are changed together with their age. Let us to trying give some explain of differences between young children’s social behavior and that of adults and define is this conclusion true or false.
Firstly, I believe, that adults and children have the different problems and, as the result, the different reactions on this situations in their life. I mean, children know that their parents decide all their hard situation, help and give some advices. Oh the other, adult’s problems – is only adult’s problems and, unfortunately, sometimes nobody can not help or solve your situation. So, adults clearly understand this fact. Secondly, adults lose the sense of beauty, the ability to have enjoyed oh every small pieces of live. Because of this, they became no so happiness as children, harder in the soul and smile and lather smaller than children. This way of life make if hardest and full of problem, which  looks like undecidable, but in the reality this is not try.
