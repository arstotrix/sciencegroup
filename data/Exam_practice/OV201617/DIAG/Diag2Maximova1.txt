The graph shows changes in tourists arrivals in different continents. It is quite easy to notice that overall the numbers tend to grow, with an exception for North America, which still has the largest numbers.
The greatest increase has happened in Central and Eastern Europe; in here, the amount of visitors has grown twice in between 1990 and 1995, up to 60 million arrivals, then for another 10 million in 2000. Finally, by 2005 three times as many people (compared to 1990) have visited the region. On the other hand, there are regions with much less change, for instance, South America and Sub-Saharan Africa. The amount of arrivals here has grown from 10 million arrivals to 15 million in South America and 20 million in Sub-Saharan Africa. Numbers in South-East Asia are quite different: overall, there has been an increase from 20 to 50 million arrivals, but it was way more steady between 2000 and 2005 than from 1990 to 2000. 
North America's numbers depict another trend. Starting at the point of 70 million arrivals in 1990, the biggest number,  they peaked in 2000, showing more than 90 million tourists, but after that the graph has slightly fallen back to 90 million arrivals, just a little more than those in Central and Eastern Europe.
