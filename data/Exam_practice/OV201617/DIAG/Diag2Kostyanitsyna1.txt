A more detailed look reveals that there was a really wide gap (40 millions) between the North America and Europe in 1990. Then, by 2005, there had been an increase in numbers for Europe, it hit 85 millions arrivals. Moreover, the South-East Asia had an increase in numbers during this period too. In 1990 it had 20 millions and reached its highest level in 2005, there were almost 50 millions arrivals. Sub-Saharan Africa and the South America were almost at the same level in 1990, near 10 millions arrivals, but 1995 was the year when the gap between them started to widen, then in 2005 Africa had over 20 millions and the South America had just 15% .

Clearly, there were the same trends for all of the parts of the world, but the North America was always the most popular place to visit.
