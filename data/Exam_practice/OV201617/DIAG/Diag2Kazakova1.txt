The graph shows the dependance between the number of millions of international tourist arrivals and the year. There are five different parts of the world observed: North America, Central and Eastern Europe, South-East Asia, Sub-Saharn Africa, and South America. There is its own curve for each part of the world.
The obvius leader through all the years is North America. Its curve only rised between  the 1990 and the 2000 and was almost at the same level between the 2000 and 2005. At first Central and Eastern Europe had much less number of arrivals than North America had, but by the 2005 these two parts almost came to the same level. Europe has the most dramatic rise of its curve. South-East Asia is the third by the number of millions of arrivals. Its curve is quite straight and only rises. At the 1990 the curves of Sub-Saharn Africa and South America began at the same point, but then Sub-Saharn Africa's curve rised a slightly higher than the South America's one. 
All in all, from the graph I have figured out that the most popular part of the world for tourists is North America, the Central and Eastern Europe by the 2005 has gained almost the same popularity. South-East Asia is in the middle. Sub-Saharn Africa and South America are not so successful in developing of tourism.
