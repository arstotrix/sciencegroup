The modern world provides us with issures we didn't used to face before.
Nowadays, when people have more opportunities to make a choise of their futute career, many of them prefer to choose that one that brings a lot of 

money because big salary results in better life. But others believe that it is important to get pleasure from your job rather than to make a profit. The essay 

examines both aspects of this problem.

The disscussion I want to start with the observation of the first point of view. For them job is concerned only as the way to make a living and they have 

rational reasons for this. Firstly, it is a certanly clear that without money we cannot even survive in this world, and only money are able to provide us with 

our everyday feature. Money are responsible for our enjoable and fulfil lives and thus big salary ensures people's happyness. The further aspest that 

explain the tendecy of making money that i would consider is changed priorities in the modern world. The driving force behind the trend is capitalistic 

relationspips between people in order to which everyone pursue aims to be as rich and successful as others are.

However, there is an another poit of view. Inspite of these factors that make people choose more profitable job, there is a factor of pleause. Others 

belive that it is much mome important because a job is not merely a way to earn, but the way to develop yourself as personality. When you choose an 

interesring and satisfactory job, you feel happy not only when you spend your money on your recreational leasure time.

Personally, I am of the second opinion, because I belive that our live is short enough to spend it on earning and it is impossible to live for yourself, not for 

society and for respectfulness from it.
