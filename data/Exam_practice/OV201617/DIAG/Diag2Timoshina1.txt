The given graph shows data about international tourist visits in some parts of the world, with a further classification of amount of people, from 1990 to 2005.

Overall, there was a significant increase in number of international tourists arrivals all over the world. The highest amount of tourists in 1990 was in North America - at about 70 millions, and it was still the highest amount here in 2005 (at about 90 millions). Meanwhile the lowest level of international tourists was in South America - at lower than 10 millions in 1990 and at about 20 millions in 2005.

If we take a closer look we can see that changes in level of tourists were significantly different. For instance, the amount of international visitors in Central and Eastern Europe has risen sharply from 30 millions to 90 millions. At the same time the figure of tourists in South America was almost stable - it has reached just 15 millions (from 10 millions). Another situation took place in South-East Asia: the amount of international visitors there has increased gradually from 20 millions to 50 millions. I suppose this information reflect the developing processes in tourism industry, which, of course, are much more faster in developed part of the world such as Central and Eastern Europe.

To sum up, it is obvious that amount of international tourist arrivals tends to grow up in future - faster for developed and developing contries, slower for poor and less economically advanced contries.
