The problem of choice between money and enjoyable job has always been argued among people. I think that it depends of a person and of situation. Sometimes it is impossible to let to oneself have an enjoyable work. But what we have to do in the worse case? When a dream work and a good salary have not got any intersection? Of course, in a perfect case each one of us would like to unify the two. 
But our life proves that probability of it is super-low. For example, a teacher can not earn millions. Another example - a man or a woman who has to earn money for his or her family, would choose money. And I'm sure that it's a normal behaviour and there isn't any adequate solution more.
We can take an ideal case: an independent person who has not got children, ill parents or other people he or she has to earn for. In this case the person has liberty and, in my opinion, has not to refuse the job he or she has dreamed about (and I would do the same way) but can do it. It is a question of priorities.
On the other hand, there is a lot of noble causes, I think, it's not bad to spend money for. 
The first one is family and the second - charity. The person who refuse his or her own interests for these reasons has to be more respected that that one who enjoys his or her job.
To conclude, I think that it is very personal problem that each person can resolve by him or herself.
