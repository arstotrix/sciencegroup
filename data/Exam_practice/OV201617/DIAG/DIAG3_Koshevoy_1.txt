The scheme bellow illustrates the way how leather goods are produced. It is noticeable that this process considers 11 steps before the leather is going to be used in the equipment production, so it is a long-term process.   

The production begins by drying the animal skin, then it is transported by the truck to the factory. In the next step, the leather is washed in the mixture of water and lime. Then, the leather is soaking in lime. 

The next stage consists in the flattering of the soaked leather in the special machine. After that process, the leather is soaked second time in the tannin â€“ the mixture of water and the vegetable matter. Then the leather is polished with a special tool and transferred by the truck to another factory. This leather now is ready to be used in clothing or sport equipment production.
