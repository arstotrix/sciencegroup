The graph provides information about the different continents visited by millions of tourists in a period between 1990 and 2005.

According to the graph, the main tendency was an increase in the amount of arrivals by the end of these fifteen years. Central and Eastern Europe has experienced a significal growth with 30 millions of arrivals in 1990 and just under 90 millions in 2005. In contrast, the numbers of tourists in Sub-Saharan Africa and South America rised gradually, both making up about 10 millions of arrivals in 1990 and reaching a peak in 2005 with just over 20 millions for Sub-Saharan Africa and just under this number for South America. Similarly, the quantity of arrivals in South-East Asia showed a gradual increase. In comparison to it, Noth America experienced a considerable growth with a peak in 2000 (from 70 to over 90 millions of arrivals) and then showed a downward  tendency.

A closer look reveals that numbers of the arrivals to North America have always been much higher than to other places, except for Central and Eastern Europe, where the numbers become the same as in North America in 2005. The smallest amount of tourists is shown by Sub-Saharan Africa and South America, reaching only 20 millions in 2005. South-East Asia illustrates the medium numbers, rising to 40 millions of arrivals in 2005.

Overall, the numbers of arrivals in different parts of the world tend to rise during this period. We might expect an increase in the percentage of the tourists visiting these places in the future, except for North 
America, which showed a decline between 2000 and 2005.
