The graph shows the number of tourists who visited different parts of the world for years 1990 to 2005.

Overall, it is clear that North America and Central and Eastern Europe were the most popular places during this period, when South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa and South America were less in demand.

The number of tourists rose each year between 1990 and 2005, but this increasing was different in speed. For example, a number of people arrived in South-East Africa had reached a peak of 50 million by 2005, when a number of tourists in Central Africa doubled significantly from 30 million in 1990 to 90 million in 2005.

It is also important to notice that in spite of the fact that rise in tourists took place in all the regions, the absolute number of people from abroad was completely different in 1990 from less than 10 million tourists in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa to more than 70 million tourists in North America.
