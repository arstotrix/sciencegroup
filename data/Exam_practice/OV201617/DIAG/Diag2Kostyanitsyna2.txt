It is true that nowadays most people prefer having a job with a big salary to having an enjoyable job. I find this approach wrong, while some people are more skeptical l about it.
In my opinion, you should find a job that will make you happy. Firstly, working is an essential part of our lives. We spend most of our time sitting in our offices. Thus, it is very important to enjoy your work because you will be able to handle with this routine, and it will not make you angry, which is very bad for your health. Secondly, if you are interested in things you do, you always want to learn something new and have more practice.  As a result, you develop your personal skills, which can help you to get a high-paid job. 
Nevertheless, some people are quick to point out that a good salary is the most important thing. As an adult you have a lot of responsibilities like paying the bills or buying food. Owning to it, if you are an artist or an author, it is very hard to earn money from your work. So, these people have to find something else to do to make money for living. Besides, according to them, with a good salary you can afford travelling or buying things that you really want. Thus, you can be happy, despite the fact that you do not enjoy your job. 
In conclusion, I would like to stress that you can have a good salary and a job you like at the same time.  I think that if you really the thing you do, it is very easy to be successful and earn a lot of money. The main key is hardworking!
