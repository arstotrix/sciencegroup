Career choice is an important topic for many discussions. People can’t come to an agreement whether it is more important to have a job which would make you happy and bring you joy or to earn a lot of money.
Firstly, one of the reasons people get a job is to get paid and have money for their living. It makes sense that higher salary attracts more employees and effects teenagers’ choice of the future careers. One might say that money can’t buy you happiness, but all the great things which can make you happy cost money, unfortunately, this is inevitable.
At the same time, it is important to remember that an average adult spends at work around 7-8 hours every day. It is hard to imagine a person who would be unhappy with what he does and yet enjoy their life because of the great amount of money they get.  People should get satisfaction from what they do, this way they don’t feel totally exhausted by the end of the day and still have some energy to enjoy life and do something with their family and friends.  Moreover, if you like your job, you more sufficiently carry out your duties and become more successful at your position. 
All in all, I believe that a perfect job must bring you joy as much as be a good source of money. If the person enjoys what he does and get paid well,  he can’t be more happy than he already is.
