We all know that when children become adult, their social behaviour may changes. Sometimes it changes very little, sometimes not.
On my personal opinion the main reason why does social behaviour changes is that, our surrounding changes by year. That means, that we always have to adopt to new people, places and doings.
As a reason our behaviour changes in the same way. For example, I have friends in school. And we all likes watching movies. After graduating, I am not able to spend time with my school friend and in case of that I start spend time with my university friends who like reading books. 
As a result I will adopt to my new friends. That will change my lexical, my social behaviour and my interests.
The second reason is, responsibility. As a child we do not have any responsibility by the law. But as an adult person we have to be much more fearful and strict to our conversations and deeds. 
On the other hand there are some other types of changes in human social behaviour. For example, children often call every guy they know as a "friend" and when they become adult, they lost those friends.
For example, in school I had around 20 guys whom I was calling "friends". Few years later, I have only 2 real friends, and I have lost any connection with other 18 guys.
To sum up, I want to say that our social behaviour does not radical defers in childhood and adult. if person is very shy she will not become very talkative. And on my personal opinion, if there are any changes in social behaviour take place they are good.
