The given graph presents us the information about the number of international tourists having been travelling from 1990 to 2005 in different countries. According to the data introduced one can notice one significant feature:  the positions of the countries accepted the international travelers  had not changed (only Sub-Saharan Africa had started to have more tourists since mid-90s than South Africa) and almost all numbers of tourists had been rising from the 90s to the 2000s. The statistic shows that the number of Central and Eastern Europe visitors had most crucially changed through the introduced years in comparison to the other countries.  It had two critical points:  the number was raising rapidly up to the 1995 and had reached the 60 millions people by near 1995, after for five years changings were swooth and after 2000 the amount of travellers started to increase again. As for South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan  Africa and South America is that they  accepted more and more visitors but in slightly slower pace than Central and Eastern Europe. Considering North America, it was a peak point in the end of the 20th century when the tourists number was the highest ever all over the countries and it consisted more than 90 millions of people. However, we can pay our attention that there was a fall in the begining of the following century in the number of travelers in the North America.  Taking into consideration all Information given in the line-graph we can say that overall trends were conserving and dominate players keep their position.
