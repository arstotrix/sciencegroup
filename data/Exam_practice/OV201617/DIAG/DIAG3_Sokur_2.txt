There is an opinion that when children are grown up, they change their social behaviour somehow. It makes obvious the fact that child’s behaviour differs from adult’s one. However, it differs not always in a good way. I agree with this statement.
To start with, children do not have to think about serious stuff like money or a job. Therefore, they are much dreamier and light at mind. Children are always positive about their present and future. As they grow and gain life experience, most of them become grumpier and have less interest to explore the world around them.
Furthermore, while a child becomes an adult, he or she has to consider more and more things. For example, a choice of educational after school changes child’s lifestyle and make him of her reflect about interests and future plans. Then a choice of a career is serious matter because a job corresponds to interests and financial needs and the same time. Consequently, people in their adulthood become more responsible and careful.
On the one hand, children are more independent socially. They often more impulsive and emotional and tend to make fast and unthoughtful decisions that can affect someone’s feelings. Adults always try walking in other people’s shoes before actions. On the other hand, children are financially dependent on their parents which make impact on their behaviour when they want get something which is unavailable for them. In this matter, adult people mostly feel free. 
In the conclusion I would like to say, there is a difference between social behaviour of children and adults and each of them has its good and bad sides. I believe that growing up is a wonderful process which gives to a person a lot of opportunities.
