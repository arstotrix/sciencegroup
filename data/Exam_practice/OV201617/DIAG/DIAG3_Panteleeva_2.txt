As far as I am concerned, children change their behaviour in the society after having become adults. It is obvious, because there are a lot of evidence that can prove this statement. In this essay I will give some arguments supporting the idea that there are a lot of differences between adults and children.
To begin with, the main difference connected with children's and adults' social behaviour is in their speeches. Sometimes children do not think with whom they speak to. Having conversation with the teacher, a child can use rude words as he or she considers his or her tutor equal to the parents. Adults always think with whom they talk and do not make such mistakes as children often do. The next main difference is in actions. There is one evident example proving the statement that children are far alike from adult people. When men meet each other they firstly give their hands to each other. It is a custom that is spread among adults. When children become older they start to do the same things. The third main feature that makes difference between children and adults is a look. In the society it is very importrant how you are looking. You always can see adults in costumes that are not bright at all. Children like to wear colourful clothes and do not follow the fashion. Women and men try to think where they will go in advance and it helps them to choose what clothes they will wear today. In this case children are considered to be irresponsible.
All in all, to my mind, it is always good when children become adults as they become more responsible. They start to think before making something.
