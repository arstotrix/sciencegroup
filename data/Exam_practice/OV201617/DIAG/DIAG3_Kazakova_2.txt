Anyone observing how young children behave and communicate and how adults do can see obvious differences. It isn't a secret that growing up influences on the social behaviour in some way. Usually the changes are positive. It is supposed to think that young human learns to be more suitable in society. But there can be some negative sides. What are the main differences in behaviour of children and adults?
The first thing is that young children, while becoming adults, learn not to express their emotions too loud or even at all. Children are not always able to behave politely in social places like theatre or cinema. They need to express their opinion and emotions about what they see. This causes such situations as children yelling in opera or trying to touch animals in the zoo. For example, my friend's daughter Mabel used to loudly comment pieces in the theatre, until some couple said her parents that it isn't polite. Normal adults do not behave that way. But the negative side is these adults who cannot express emotions at all. They are polite and nice, but actually they cannot open themselves to other people.
The second obvious difference is in way adults and children make friends. Young children usually do not choose friends carefully and make friends with any human who is approximately the same age or agree to play with them, especially in their favourite games. And adults usually have not so many friends and making new friends can be difficult for them, even if they want to. For example, my friend Elena was very sociable girl at school, but now she is in universuty, and her only friends still be few classmates.
All in all, I think, growing up always causes some changes in social behaviour and it is normal. Probably, parents should notice when such changes are becoming not normal, but hyperbolic.
