The diagram given reveals information on the process of producing leather goods.

Just with a quick look at the diagram we can assume that producing leather goods is quite a complicated procedure. Actually, it can be divided in two crucial stages: preproccessing and actual processing of the raw material at the factory. Of course there are also other important substages. These would be mentioned further altogether with stages discussed above.

The whole process initiates with the procedure of drying animal skin. Then these raw materials are transported to the factory where the key part of the whole process takes place.

But drying raw skin is not the limit for the preprocessing stage. It is continued here at the factory by washing dryied skin in the water mixed with with lime. Then, before entering the stage of actual processing, the skin is being soaked with the help of lime. And thats the point where the actual process of producing leather goes up.

After being soaked the pieces of animal skin are being flattened with the help of special machines. The next stage lies in another soaking procedure but this time in Tannin -- so called mixture of water and vegetable matter. After that half-processed materials enter the final stage -- the stage of polishing which is executed again by means of machines. And finally with all the stages completed leather materials are ready to be transported to the factories which produce clothes.

Summing all up, it becomes clear that producing leather goods appears to be complex and diversified process including different stages of processing raw materials.
