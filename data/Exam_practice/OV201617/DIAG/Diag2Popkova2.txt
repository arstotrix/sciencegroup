It goes without a shadow of doubt that the issue about a choice of your future career, your tomorrow occupation is the most crucial for every graduate student. Nowadays, there are two arguable points of view: to earn a lot of money but do unpleasant job or do what you are eager to do but non concerning the beneficial side of your work. 
First of all, I would like to say that each job could be unpleasant and annoying whatever you do. This is because big deals start with the small. Moreover, making first steps of our career we get stuck with the first problems and obstacles which can fed us up.  In this case it does not depend on passion you have - every job may seem inconvenient for us due to its routin killing any interest. Therefore, I this case a great salary acts as a goal, as a stimulus to fulfill unpleasant things. 
But on the other hands, many people believe that doing your prescribed occupation is the best way to be promoted on the higher positions and, thus, earn huge sum of money. As Confucius said: “Do what you love and you would not work even a day in your life’. This quote definitely describes the advantages of doing what you are really fond of. Not what your parents want you to do, not what society supposes to be prestigious and highly paid, but what your soul is asking for.  
Taking into consideration all I mentioned above I would like to say that everybody should try to do as many fields of interests as he or she can. Ultimately, we all will find the place we are supposed to be. Great money is a good goal but it should not be the main one you are chasing for. Nevertheless, it is better to remember that no one occupation goes without any efforts and obstacles, so your will power and great passion will give you a satisfaction and great salaries.
