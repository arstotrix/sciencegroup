It is well known that when children become adults, the way they behave changes in some aspects. But what are the main differences between two types of behavior? These changes are good for the society? 

It is really important to cover the children way of behavior. Firstly, children are usually acting friendlier than adults do. They have less social difficulties, such as restraint or enmity to certain social groups, so they can easily become friends with anyone. Secondly, they are more interested in communication, because this is a certain way to discover they surroundings. For instance, when I was a child, I wanted to make friends with anyone, even with the adults, because it was so exciting to me. 

In general adults act differently than kids do. When a person grows up, it experiences a lot of negative sides of communication. So it becomes more difficult to stay friendly, because of these negative experiences.  Furthermore, adults have less time then children do, so they have not much opportunity to make friends with anyone. And usually they already have formed they social environment, so they have no needs to make more friends. For example, when I come to a place, when I knew someone, I always try to stay with them and not try to contact other people. 

To sum up, it it clearly seen, that the changes are really significant, but this changes are really natural, because of some reasons. In my opinion, they are not good or bad, they are just normal.
