The diagram provides information about the process of leather goods production.
At one time, animal skin was collected and made dry. After that it was transported to the factory, where the washing process took place. Firstly, the skin was put in a big container filled with water and lime for some time and then the container was changed to a smaller one filled with lime and the soaking process began. 
Following that the skin was flattened with a special machine. As soon as it was flattened enough, it was moved to the container with tannin, which consisted of water and vegetable matter. The next step was polishing and once it was completed, the animal skin was finally transported to the factory, where clothes were eventually made. 
Clearly, producing leather goods is not easy and includes a number of stages, needs two factories and cars to transport the skin to them.
