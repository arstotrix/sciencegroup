It is argued, what is more important in life, to earn a living doing something that is enjoyable to you or to make much more money with a less pleasant way.
If you work on a suitable job, you are happy every day doing what you like and what you are goot at.
You wake up every morning with an inspiration for working and a feeling of you being at the right place in your life.
Moreover, years of studying in a college or a univercity for this job will be more pleasant to you and the education will be exciting and interesting.
On the other hand, a lot of money can make you happy and you can afford yourself anything you want to make your life more exciting and luxurious.
You can be sure you can pay for expencive medicine needed, products of a higher quality, education for you and your children, and always stand on your own feet.
Becides you can do what you like as your hobby at your spare time.
Personally, I think that a good salary leads you to a better life with many opportunities including what you could do working on your favorite job with less calary, but for those who's goal of life is not a high quality of life but a family and being useful for this world, making good money is not needed.
