Nowadays having a prestigious, well-paid job is an essential part of oneâ€™s life. Many people hold the opinion that work should give you only great amounts of money. Those who disagree with it point out that the best job is the job that brings you a plenty of satisfaction. 

I am absolutely sure, that this question has to be tackled on a number of levels. First of all, without high salary no one could make his or her living well enough. In fact, you are not able to travel around the world or buy needed goods. Sometimes parents cannot even pay for their children education or enough food and clothes for them. Secondly, good income means proper living conditions. For instance, to buy a flat in Moscow one should spend at least two million or to be in debt for the whole life. 

People with the opposite opinion claim that your job should be enjoyable. Firstly, if your work disappoints or even annoys you, you should immediately leave it because such occupation is the main reason for you stress and anxiety. So, this can lead to, for example, divorce or just misunderstanding between you and your relatives. However, if your job gives you satisfaction, you have more power to move forward on the career. Thus, it can end up with you being appointed even to director.

To conclude with, I strongly believe the thing that you do for the whole life must bring you lots of pleasure and enjoyment in order not to make you nervous every day and become your favorite hobby and not just a routine work.
