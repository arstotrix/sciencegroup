The process of growing up can change the person drastically. There are no doubts that becoming an adult changes the child's social behaviour. 

First of all, one of the main differences in child's and adult's behaviour is the temper. When a child does not get what they want, they start screaming unconditionally. This happens because a young child does not yet understandd that the world is not controlled by their will. An adult, however, understands it perfectly, therefore, no healthy adults can start screaming at their boss when they do not get promoted, for example. Secondly, children are innocent and free of prejudice, while grown ups tend to judge others severely.This feature is definitely caused by society. Last but not least, children in general trust more easily. It might happen because the world is still their oyster, and for adults the world can be a dark and cruel place. 

However, these changes do not exactly mean that a grown up person becomes worse. It can be good, because growing up is connected to learning. Adulthood teaches a person that you cannot always get what you want, that not all people are trustworthy and, most importantly, you are not the center of the universe. These lessons make one a stronger and wiser person. 

Overall, I think that all changes that take place are good, except for the tendency to judge others or talk behind their back. In my opinion, it is great to save a little bit of an inner child inside you. This might make your life easier.
