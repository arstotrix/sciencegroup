The graph depicts information about international tourist arrivalsin millions from 1990 to 2005 for five regions of the world.
In the year 1990 North America has had the greatest amount of tourists,which is a little more than 70 millions. On the other hand Sub-Saharan Africa and South America have had the least - about 8.5 millions tourist arrivals. South-East Asia and Central and Eastern Europe have had a little more success than the latter two at about 21 millions and 31 millions respectively.
Through the given period of fifteen years the smallest change of this statistic is for Sub-Saharan Africa and South America. Although they are now on slightly different levels, the numbers are still rather close - a little more than 20 millions for the former and something around 18 millions for the latter.

South-East Asia shows slight but steady rise from 21 to about 48 millions in the given 15 years.
