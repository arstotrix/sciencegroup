In today's society the choice between an enjoyable job and a profitable one is among of the most difficult choices the man ever makes. 

Undoubtly, enjoyable job brings you peace of mind, as well as significantly lessens the amount of daily stress you are under. Having found the right job for yourself, you feel like you have found your place in the world. Moreover, there is no need for any external motivation for self-development, because you want to learn to become better at what you do and not because you have to do it.

However, the views of the people who think that the more rational choice is a job that allows you to earn a significant amound of money should not be dismissed. These people argue that with money you can potentialy afford all the other things that usually bring you happiness. It can also be possible that your future wife or husband will take notice of you in the first place because of your wealth, and your marrige will be stable, and love will come later. 

As for me, I believe that there is always an opportunity to find middle ground between these two types of jobs. One can easily integrate in his or her line of work some elements that help in making substantial amounts of money. In my opinion, every person should strive to find this balance.
