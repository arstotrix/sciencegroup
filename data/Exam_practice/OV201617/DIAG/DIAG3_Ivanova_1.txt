The given diagram depicts the process of manufacturing leather and leather products. Generally, the process consists of eight stages, including transportation. 

The manufacturing process is not so easy as one may consider. Firstly, a proper animal skin needs drying. After being dried, it is delivered to a factory, where it is washed in a prepared mixture of water and lime. Then the skin is soaked in lime for some time. The next stage is called flattening. For this phase, huge rolls are used. After being flattened on the special machine, the skin is soaked again, but not in water and lime. On this phase water is mixed with vegetable matter, and the mixture is called tannin. The last stage of skin manufacturing is polishing. 

After all these phases, the prepared skin is ready for subsequent production. It is delivered to another factory, where it is used to produce different leather goods.
