It is fairly often said that having a job you like is more important than earning a lot of money and having a high salary. Let us consider both opinions and make an own one. 

To begin with, people typically spend much time working. That is why it is rather important to have a job that brings hapiness and feel of pleasure, despite a salary is not so good as one want to have. Firstly, a happy job helps to keep nerveous system in a good condition and live a healthier life. Secondly, the productivity and creativity are at their highest level when one likes his or her job. That helps to work better and have better results, even when a salary does not matter indeed. 

On the other hand, when a person is not enough paid for their work, they become uninterested and easily get bored. That leads to loosing the motivation to develop their professional skills and even may start working even worse. Moreover, when a person is paid little money, they start searching opportunities to find another job or even two, so they try to cope with two or three positions in different companies. That is the reason for constant tireness and depression. 

As for me, it is important to have a job that you like as well as get well paid for this work. It is crucial to be always in a good physical and mental condition and to feel pleasure by doing your work. That is the consequence of having a job you like. Anyway, every single worker should be paid enough money in order to stay motivated, healthy and having enough money not to try to work in different companies.
