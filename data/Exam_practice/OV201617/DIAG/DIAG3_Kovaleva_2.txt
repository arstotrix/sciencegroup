As we grow up, our perceptions of the world change with us. Our views on politics, love, friendship, entertainment and education go through a series of changes and some of these changes, in turn, drastically affect our social behaviour. 

When young, children often seem naive in some aspects, conserning social interactions. There are instances, for example, when they do not understand when it is requered to be tactful and not to ask a question, which by an adult might be considered rude. In many cases this happens because they have not completely learned to differentiate between different emotions or have not yet learned the connotations usual to some of the unknown situations. By contrast, this lack of knowledge is often the main reason for the existence of the carefree childhood attitude, that gives them opportunity to fully enjoy themselves in their everyday activities.

It is highly difficult, if not even impossible, however, to conclude whether the changes that take place are more detrimental to their social interaction than not. It is my firm belief that it is a subjective matter, which significantly depends on what a person values more it his or her life. 

Overall, the changes in social behaviour when growing up are unavoidable, and they have some drawbacks as well as advantages for the later life of a child.
