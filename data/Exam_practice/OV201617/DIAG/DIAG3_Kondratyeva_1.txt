The given diagram shows how leather goods are produced. It is quite clear, that process of producing leather goods consists of many steps and some of them repeat.
Firstly, animal skin needs to be delivered to the first factory. Here the factory's employees wash it using water and lime. Then they leave it for soaking, and for this process they also use lime. Then animal skin needs to be flattened with a special machine. After that step it goes through the soaking stage again, but this time, in contradistinction to the first part of soaking, employees use tannin, which is a combination of water and vegetable manner, instead of lime. The next step is polishing the skin with special equipment. And after this stage animal skin is ready for production. Then it goes to another factory, where it is used for producing leather goods, for example, shoes, jackets or bags.
