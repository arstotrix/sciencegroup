The graph provides information regarding the number of international tourist arrivals in various parts of the world between 1990 and 2005.
Overall, 4 figures presented did not show any considerably sharp alterations, while the one in the middle of the graph depicts a rather interesting trend.
A closer look at the graph reveals that the amount of international tourist arrivals in Central and Eastern Europe in 1990 clearly differs from that in 2005.
The number of arrivals was rising more or less remarkably during 15 years and got from just over 30 millions to almost 90 millions.
However, this significant rise did not put this region to the first place in this statistics.
It is clear from the graph that the biggest amount of international tourist arrivals has always been accepted by North America.
Just above 70 millions of arrivals took place in this region in 1990 and North America finally remained on the leading position in 2005 with 90 millions of arrivals.
It is interesting to notice that other 3 figures show rather slight aterations with general increase of about 10 millions in South America,
approximately 15 millions in Sub-Saharan Africa and just above 20 millions in South-East Asia.
To sum up, all the regions presented in the graph experienced a rise of the amount on international tourist arrivals in comparison of 1990 and 2005 but the level of significance was unique in each situation.
