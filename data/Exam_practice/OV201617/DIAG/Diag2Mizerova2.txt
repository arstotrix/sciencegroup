There is no doubt, that everyone must choose a job, everyone has to make something for a living. But witch job is better: the one, that makes you happy or the one, that gives you an opportunity to earn a lot of money? As for me, this question is very controversal. The answer depends on lots of factors.
On the one hand, you should always listen to your heart, you always should always find something, that inspires you. If work, that you do every day, makes you unhappy, frustrates you, you'd better find some other one. Otherwise, you'll constantly be under a lot of stress, you will not be able to live the full life. Moreover, the doctors say, that stress can cause some health problems.
On the other hand, your salary is also very important. Imagine that you don't have enough money to eat, to pay fares, to go to the theatre, to use transport...
Money can solve all the problems, that's why it is essential to have some.
All in all, everyone should find a balance between a well-paid job and a dream job. As for me, I can't do anything without inspiration. I'd better do something that less paid, than something I'm not interested in, something that I don;t like at all.
