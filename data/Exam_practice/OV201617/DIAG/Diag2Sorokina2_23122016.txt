It is a stated well-known fact that in recent years, peopleâ€™s expanses on needs has increased dramatically, especially in developed countries. One may interpret that from different perspectives and hence this topic remains controversial and debatable one. 

To begin with, the fact that the growing number of people can afford buying thing goods for sheer entertainment reflects that their quality of life has become higher. In contrast to previous ages, when people earned money just enough to fulfil their daily needs (I guess, art worker could not imagine such a luxury -- not to buy goods wholesale), nowadays more and more citizens of the countries with well-developed economy do not have to tighten their belts to make their ends meet.  From this outlook, it is a rather good tendency. Besides, people doing shopping as a hobby, in fact, make the world economy go round, otherwise it would collapse and crisis would likely to begin. 

However, the money- and consumption-orientated nature of the modern society cannot be over-estimated. Growing overproduction has many drawbacks for nature and culture. Actually, one may argue that there are much more reasonable ways to spend money -- travelling, donating, charity, etc. Personally, I fully agree. Indeed, many people collect things they do not need just for a pleasure.  However, how is it different from an ordinary collecting, in terms of hobby? 

To sum up, shopping as a leisure time activity does not appeal to me. Nevertheless, I think it is telltale evidence of the changes in the modern society, which I consider to be the good ones.
