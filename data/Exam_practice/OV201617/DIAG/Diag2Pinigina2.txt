A job is one of the most significant part of an usual person's life. There are two different points of view on the question what is more important - to have a good salary or to enjoy your job. I would prefer to get pleasure from my work that earn a lot of money, although, in my opinion, these two things are related.

It is inevitable that a good salary leads to life without financial problems. People who earn much money are able to afford themselves much more than other ones. However, it is a contemporary question if a lot of money is enough for happiness. There are many examples of people who have an enormous amount of money, but they do not use it for themselves and do charity.

What is more, a situation, when a person hates his or her work, leads to illnesses and even an early death, which is a considerable reason to think if it is really so important to go against your own nature and do something you do not want to do.

On the one hand, it is arguable that person can love his work that does not bring him any money. Suspend that only enjoyment can make him or her a good worker is wrong.

On the other hand, if a person wants to do his or her work, it helps him or her to work more any, anyway, a little or a lot of money will be got. 

As far as I am concerned, the satisfaction from what you do contains both of salary and enjoyment and, probably, some other factors. However, I believe that an enjoyable job can help to earn money.
