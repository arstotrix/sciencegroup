It is not a secret that with development in technologies the meaning of the Internet is growing. Nowadays people have got an opportunity to do many different things with the Internet, including communication and searching information. However, while the Internet have brought many benefits to the world, it can be argued that such development has more negative aspects than positive. The essay examines all arguments for and against the usage of the Internet.
On the one hand, with the Internet people can get reply to almost every question in a few seconds, so it has become very easy to find a solution to problems. Furthermore, there are many talented and interesting people from all over the world and only with the Internet everyone managed to communicate with them. Moreover, the amount of information allows us to develop our skills in every sphere we want, for example, by an access to online education courses. This motivates people to come up with ideas to help science or society.
On the other hand, others have arguments to deny the advantages. In their opinion the Internet is not the best place to find information because of dirt that Internet consist of. Because of the lack of control, it is everywhere in the net and this can lead to spreading these filthy ideas out of the Internet . Secondly, information, that we can find on the internet is often fake and we can be misled. 
As for me, I agree with the first set of arguments. I believe that even though the disadvantages are significant, they cannot overweigh all pluses of the internet. Regardless to dirt and falsity there are a lot of helpful things that have appeared only this the internet.
To sum up, the internet is really one of the most important and significant inventions.
