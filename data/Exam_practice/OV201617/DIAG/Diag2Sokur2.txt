When people graduate from universities, they often have to make a difficult career choice: what is more important – pleasure and money?
Some people believe that feeling joy during your work time is more important than earning money. You cannot buy happiness with money, but you can get it if you do what you want and what you feel passion for. Furthermore, a job takes most of your life time. If you always do something you do not like, you will not be able to stand it very soon. It will make you feel depressed most of the time and take most of your powers away so you cannot do anything else except your job.
However, there is an opposite point of view. There are people who are determined that making a lot of money is the most important thing in a human’s life because in our world everything is based on money. Firstly, you have to pay for everything: food, a place to live, spending your free time, education, transport, health. It becomes even more important if you have somebody to provide – family, for example. Secondly, if you do not like your job, you always can find a hobby you feel desire for. You will have an opportunity to take this hobby because you have money. Besides, you always can afford going on a vacation to make you feel better.
All in all, whichever choice you make – pleasure or money, they both have positive and negative sides. But, undoubtedly, a human cannot live without pleasure and it is a personal choice of each how to get it.
