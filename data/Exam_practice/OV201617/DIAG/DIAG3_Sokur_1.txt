The diagram below demonstrates the method of the production of leather goods. It has seven different stages.
At the beginning, animal skin has to be dried. After that, it is transferred to a factory with a truck. The second stage is when animal skin is washed in a mix of water and lime. Then on the third stage it is soaked with lime. On the fourth stage it is flattened with special equipment. The fifth stage represents the process of soaking with tannin – the substance which consists of water and vegetable matter. Once it is over, animal skin gets polished. The seventh stage starts when produced leather is driven on a car to another factory. There different goods – for example, shoes, bags or sport equipment – are made from this leather.
Producing of leather goods is a long process. Due to that, we have things of prime necessity in our shops.
