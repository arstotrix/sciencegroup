The given diagram illustrates the manufactural way of producing leather goods. The first step of the intricate process is drying the animal skin down. Then the skin must be delivered to the leather factory, where it is transformed into the material that can be used in production of other goods. At the factory the skin is washed in the water with the addition of lime juice and soaked in pure lime juice after. The next step after this process is flattening the skin out using a press.  After that, skin is soaked, just as before, but this time in tannin, which is water mixed with vegetable matter.  The skin is polished next and this is the last step in producing fine leather. Then the leather is transported to another factory, where the different kinds of goods, such as clothing, shoes, bags, balls and other products, are made out of it.
