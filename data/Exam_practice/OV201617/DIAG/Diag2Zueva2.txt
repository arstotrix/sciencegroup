The problem of being unsatisfied with a job is under heated discussions nowadays. It is widely believed that the amount of the salary is far more important than an interest in the job while some people see the situation differently.

On the one hand, people definitely should be aware of the job they choose and of all its advantages and disadvantages. It is apparent that they should have a job that they appreciate and where they would fulfil their ambitions and the time spent on it would not be wasted. 

However, the critics advocate an opposing opinion. They claim that people have to earn a lot of money to make a living due to the high prices on everything in the modern world. According to this statement, many people tend to pay attention only to the amount of money they can get, when choosing a job. 

Personally, I tend to think that the process of choosing a profession can be very complicated and confusing. In spite of this, people should first think of the occupation that would appeal to them and then only consider the amount of the amount of money they can earn. Getting satisfaction of the work means a lot, since the productivity and efficiency of an employee depends on it. Otherwise, we would end up having a lot of people of different professions not interested in what they are doing.

In conclusion, I would say that this problem can remain debatable for a long time, but I stick to the opinion that people should choose the job, first regarding their interests and then only the possible salary.
