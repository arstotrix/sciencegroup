People have different ways to behave. Many of them are called by traditions, culture, ways of bringing up but also they can have differences which simply depend on their age. Huge differences are shown during comparing actions made by adults and by children. 
First of all, during childhood people only learn the society’s rules. They still do not know all of them. Often you can meet crying or screaming in the center of any public place kid. It can happen in a park, mall, public transport station etc. Usually it happens because kids do not know well about being quiet. One of the childhood aims is to learn these rules and communicate with society according to them. Speaking about adults, they already knew basic rules. That is why they try not to ruin the personal space of other people, try to be polite and nice in aim to make others like them.
Secondly, children are not responsible for their actions yet. They do not know the world as adults do because of lack of experience. It seems to them smaller and kinder. Kids are not afraid of other people’s evil thoughts or ‘adult things’ like job and paying taxes. So because of not being warned about this dark side of life, children let themselves to act like they want and to show their truth. They have no fear to dance even if they cannot and they never feel embarrassed. They say things that they really want to say and never lose their opportunity to show their opinion. Unfortunately, adults are usually afraid to be themselves.
In conclusion, it is needed to notice that kids and adults have different picture of the world. That is why these both groups have different social behaviour and they have practically nothing in common in their society roles.
