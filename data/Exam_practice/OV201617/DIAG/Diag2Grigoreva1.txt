The graph shows how the number of tourist arrivals in different parts of the world changed in the period from 1990 to 2005. The general tendency is increasing or slight decreasing of the tourist activity. 
Let us now take a closer look on this graph. From it we can see, that Central and Eastern Europe experienced the highest rate of the growth of the number of tourists arrivals: it raised from just above 30 to 80-90 in these decades. The next part of the world, where we can notice a significant growth, is South-East Asia: the number of tourist arrivals rised up for about 30 millions. However, the tendency for North America, as the most popular touristic part of the 
world, is opposite: it rised from 1990 to 200, but then the number of tourist arrivals 
fell a little bit.
From all these figures we can conclude, that tourism becomes more and more popular activity, though in some parts of the world slightly opposite tendences can be seen.
