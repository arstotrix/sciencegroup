The diagram illustrates different stages of the production of leather goods. 
After being dried animal skin is transported to the factory, where it is being washed in the mixture of water and lime. Afterwards it is left soaking in lime for some more time before it is ready for the next step. Then animal skin is being flattened with the use of a special machine. After that is done, soaking process is being once more repeated, but this time skin of an animal is put into tannin, which is a mixture of water and vegetable matter. At the last stages skin is being polished and transported to another factory, where all types of leather goods are being produced. Leather is being cut and shaped in many different ways in order to become a final product.  
To sum up, animal skin undergoes through a series of different production processes before it is ready to be delivered to customers.
