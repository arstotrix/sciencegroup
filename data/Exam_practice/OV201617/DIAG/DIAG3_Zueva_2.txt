Throughout ages it was apparent that the way people behave in childhood and adolescence is more or less different. It is widely believed that the behaviour becomes better as a result of becoming an adult. However, it remains unclear if the changes in behaviour are actually beneficial for a person and give them more opportunities than the way they used to behave in their childhood.
In my viewpoint, people can take more advantages of the children`s view on the world than of the adults` one. Firstly, in comparison to grown-ups that are often reserved and nervous, children are a lot more outgoing and can easily have a good relationship with everybody they want. 
Moreover, adults lack of the specific interest to the world that they had when they were young and curious. The loss happens often during the school life, when the ability of children to discover new things and easily cope with novelty turns into getting used to learning everything from books and listening to lectures. If grown-ups had such an inquiring mind, there would be made much more useful inventions and a lot of research would be carried out. 
Having said this, I would like to add that it can be very difficult for children to control themselves. Although this problem takes places solely sometimes, some children can hardly control their emotions and actions in such situations when they want something or are very stressed. However, I believe that it is possible for these children to develop the ability to control themselves. 
In conclusion, I agree with the opinion that once the children become adults, the changes in their behavior do not have a lot of benefits for them.
