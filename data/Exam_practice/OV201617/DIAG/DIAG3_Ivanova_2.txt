It is a common idea that when children reach adulthood, their behaviour changes somehow. For some children, the change is not so noticeable, whereas for others it is quite radical and substantial. It is interesting to know, what are the clue differences between the way children behave and the behaviour of adults. 

In my opinion, the main difference is the attitude to responsibility. Being young, a person does not completely realize how important is to be responsible for many things that happen in one’s life. A good illustration of this is an attitude to school and work. From time to time children look for the opportunity not to go to school. They complain that they feel sick and tired, while they just do not want to be at the Chemistry class, because they loathe it. On the other hand, a teacher has no opportunity to miss their classes just because they want to go to the cinema, like sometimes children do. They are not allowed to make excuses and miss the work. If they are ill or just feel they are not in a good condition, they must get a paper from a doctor and to call the colleges. 

That illustrates that there is more responsibility in adults’ life. They must earn something for a living and care for their children or old parents. That is why they cannot always behave as they want, while children mostly can. 

Generally, the changes in social behaviour that take place are positive to a high extent. Teenagers and children learn how to manage with difficulties, how to react when somebody is being rude in the street or what to do if money is lacking. 

All in all, it is all about responsibility. A young person becomes an adult, when they realize that they are those, who is in response for the family income and the family relationships. They change their attitude to studies or work and understand that they cannot do all they want to do.
