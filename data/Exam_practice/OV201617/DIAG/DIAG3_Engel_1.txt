The following diagram describes the process of producing leather goods.

By a quick look at this set of pictures, it is clear that this process can be divided in two parts: these are the steps before flattening and stages that animal skin goes through after becoming flat. It all starts when dried animal skin gets delivered to the factory, where it is washed with water and lime. After skin is being soaked in the lime for a while, it goes through the flattening process, and one more soaking (this time in water and vegetable matter) after it. Of course, polishing is required, and then the skin is ready to become some type of leather goods which will see the store shells. To convert into actual pieces of clothes or equipment, it gets delivered once again, but to a building. 

Overall, this method of producing leather good is very complex yet necessary for the industry.
