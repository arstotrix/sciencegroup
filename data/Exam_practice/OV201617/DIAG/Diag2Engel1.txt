The graph below illustrates the amount of international tourists that arrive in various parts of the world in 15 years period.

Overall, the graph shows drastically different figures for each continent. The general trend, however, is clear. The amount of tourists is getting larger as time passes by. What is also quite noticable is that North America is the leader of international tourist arrivals, and South America has the last place in this chart. 

Central and Eastern Europe show the significant leap in arrivals: in 1990 there were just over 30 million of tourists who arrived to the region, and in 2005 it grew to around 90 million of tourists. That is slightly less than the amount of people who came to North America this same year. South-East Asia showed massive growth in the beginning of 20th century. Around 40 million of foreign tourists entered the region in 2000, and by 2005 it was already over 50 million. Sub-Saharan Africa and South America do not differ from each other much. In 2005 the amount of tourists is quite similar: around 20 millions for both regions.
