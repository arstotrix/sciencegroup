The scheme below depicts the process of leaver goods production. There are 11 stages of producing the leather from drying animal skin to getting the goods itself.
As it was mentioned before, the process of making goods begins with the stage of drying. Then skin is delivered in factory, where it needs washing in water and lime and soaking in lime. After the next stage of flattering, skin is soaked again in tannin. Then skin is polished. Eventually, it goes in the factory again and becomes one of the leather goods.
It is noticeable that there are some repetitions in the stages of production. For example, skin goes in factory twice: after drying and after polishing. In addition, the soaking is also doubled, but there are some differences: the first soaking includes lime, when the second one includes tannin, which consists of water and vegetable matter.
Overall, the process of making leather goods is complicated: it has 11 stages. However, some of them take place twice: soaking and going in factory.
