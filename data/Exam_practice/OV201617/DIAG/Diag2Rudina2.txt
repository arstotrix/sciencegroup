Which job would you prefer - for money or for your soul? People all over the world always discuss this theme. One say that you had better do boring things for a huge salary, while others believe: as you spend much time at work, you have to enjoy it. In other cases, you seem to be a unhappy person. Which of these opinions are true?
I strongly believe that you should choose a profession that can give you a satisfaction all the time. In other words, if your work annoys you, it is not suitable for you.
As we can choose among the great range of jobs, there is a possibility to find one which won't be tiring. The pleasant work gives a motivation. To earn more money, you should be better, develop and use all your skills - and it will never be boring for you to do your best there. My personal opinion here states that any talented specialist in any sphere of life can have well-paid job just because masters are such a sort of people which we always have lack of.
Nevertheless, many people argue that money can provide you a better flat or a house, a better school for children and resorts. If your work gives you money, but does not give any pleasure, just find a way to spend your salary and enjoy it! Describing situations when artists do not have even a piece of bread sometimes, people say that the most important thing in life is to have a well-drawn "cave" and food/
For me all these arguments do not make any sense because it is possible to get a promotion if you quite like what you do and to earn enough money. Even if we are in situation when we have only one variant to choose, I'd choose my good mood rather than money which cannot solve psychological problems people can have because of unpleasant lifestyle, and job is an essential part of it.
To sum up, tastes differ. It is up to you what to choose: money or enjoyable job. Each variant can make your life better, but in one aspect.
