Given is a graph summarizing data on tourism for five different destinations over a fifteen-year period, from 1990 to 2005. These destinations are South America, North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, South-East Asia, Central and Eastern Europe.

There was an upward trend for all parts of the world under study. The obvious leader is North America. In 1990, it ranked first with approximately 70 million of tourist arrivals. Over the next 10 years the figure rose steadily and reached a 90 million mark, before decreasing fractionally over the next 5 years, all the while remaining in the lead due to a considerable initial gap.

The biggest increment, however, belongs to Central and Eastern Europe. Starting at just over 30 million, the number of arrivals to this part of the world skyrocketed and tripled to  90 million, ultimately ranking second. The figures for the remaining three regions as well continued to grow, though not as sharply.

Overall, all destinations experienced a period of growth, which happened at different paces, leading to a significant narrowing of the gap between the two most popular destinations, namely North America and Central and Eastern Europe.
