According to the graph, it cannot be ignore that tourists from North America were obvious upwards. In fact, in 1990 there were more than 70 million of people from these countries, who travelled abroad. At the same time, in Europe, Asia, Africa and South America were not more than 35 million of tourists. During the period from 1990 to 2000 there was a slight increase in a number of travelers from all countries except Central and Eastern Europe. The pattern illustrates the rocketing by almost 30 million of people from these countries, who had been making various international arrivals during this period. Besides, the line that shows information about amount of tourists from South America remains approximately steady, while the number of them also varied from less than 10 million in 1990 to a little more than 20 million in 2005. However, the graph represents that a number of Central and Eastern Europe tourists shot up dramatically especially by 2005 (70 million in 2000 in contrast with 90 million in 2005). 
Overall, the graph depicts both growth and falling in quantity on international tourists. For instance, some countries, such as North and South America, Sub-Saharan Africa or South-East Asia showed a gradual rise in a number of their travelling tourists, while Central and Eastern Europe saw a sharper increase in their amount.
