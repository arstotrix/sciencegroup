The flow chart illustrates the process of lether goods production.

The initial material input is animal skin, which is at first thoroughly dryed and then transported to the factory, where the main industrial phase of the production begins. This phase can be labeled as preparation of the material before it is distributed to factories of other inductries, that are responsible for the creation of the final product.

The first step of the aforementioned preparation is comprised of washing the dryed pieces of leather in the acidic mixture of lime juice and water, before letting it soak in it. Then the leather is taken to be flattened by a specialized pressure machine. The next step is to allow the flattened material to soak again, this time in the water mixed with vegetable matter. After that the only step left is the polishing of the product. 

The leather can now be safely transported to various factories, whose main purpose is to create goods from it, such as shoes, toys and handbags.
