Many people believe that as children grow into adults, they experience a significant change in the way they behave in the society, and I agree with this statement.
First of all, it is important to understand that the roles of children and adults in the society are absolutely different. Kids have a lot less responsibilities and duties. They are only learning basic skills which are necessary for efficient living in the society. They tend to watch people and copy their behavior without realizing the actual meaning of their actions. In other words, children see the world as a game, they are not as serious as adults, they often tend to be a lot kinder than older generation and they have a lot more trust in people. For these reasons children find it a lot easier to communicate with others, while adults have more experience and know that not everyone can be trusted and in many cases become extroverts.  Kids also have a lot more energy, as they don’t have to go to work in order to earn money, their lives are easier, which makes them more active and ready to lead, they are always willing to try new things and meet new friends. Adults, on the opposite side, need rest, they are less enthusiastic and their desires range between more restful ways of spending time. It is really common for them to stay at home which unfortunately affects the amount of interactions with other people.
I think that these changes are inevitable, even though they are not always good. It might be a great idea for adults to spend more time with children in order not to forget how to be more optimistic.
All in all, age definitely affects people’s social behavior. The amount of responsibilities they have influences  their lifestyle and the way they behave as well. Unfortunately, to my mind, growing up almost never means positive changes in the social behaviour of a person.
