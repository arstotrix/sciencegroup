There have been many researches and disputes about the human psychology and sociology, particularly on the topic of children. And nowadays it is clear that children change their social behavior patterns when they become adult. 
Well, there are several stages of becoming an adult in a social way. The first is an early childhood till about twelve years. At this step a children learn how to interact with the world and especially with other children. Their communicative skills are primitive, so the main social goal of a child is to create new friends and get information about the environment.
The second stage is teenagerhood. It is time, when a child is already can share his opinion with his mates and parents. As we can here from psychologists, this is the period in which self-expression is the main problem for a kid. Every teenager looks for his own way to earn others attention. They try to find an area in which they are good.
So, the main thing that differs adults from children is that adults already know how to communicate and how to express themselves, so at this point the main goal of a person is to find their place in life, use their experience in education, work or something else to earn money for living and enjoyments, to make social connections, to gain more experience. Everyone has his own goal in life and can do anything to reach it. 
All in all, it is clear that children and adults behave completely different, but the experience, that a person gets in childhood and from  time when he was a teenager  is growing and can show profit only in adulthood.
