Some people consider having an enjoyable job being more important than earning a lot of money. Others say that a good salary ensures a better life. For me the first opinion is of course the more plausible one. I don't think a lot of people would agree with the second one, even if it were true. 
After all, almost a half of a person's adult life is spent on a job, and if that job isn't pleasant, then half of a person's life is boring and tiresome. In my opinion, even if the other half won't be as satisfying and fascinating, one should look for a kind of balance between the salary and the interest in a job, rather than having to spend half of his life in boredom. 
A good example is that of my mother's friend. After graduating with a journalist's diploma she didn't look for a well-payed job, but instead she started writing small articles on art in a newspaper about which almost no one knew. But because she loved that job, she became so good at it, that one day one of the city's biggest newspapers approached her with a work proposition. And since the tasks she was to be given there were basically the same but with a noticeably greater salary, she agreed to the job.
On the other hand, of course all of us know of a stereotype where people lead the most awful professional life in an office of some sort, thus providing at least some money for their families. It is certain that such situations are existant. But I think that if a person can pursue a career in something that he or she is fond of, that is exactly what they must do, for thus the person won't have to suffer a half of their life on a job they don't even like.
All in all, I think that only by having an enjoyable job one can have an enjoyable life, and a job they are not interested in would only make them sad.
