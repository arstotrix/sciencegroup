Well, the question is really interesting, but as I am not a psychologist, I cannot be sure here.
 
All the main differences between children and adult’s behaviors are connected with brain development and experience collecting. It’s evident, that children are much more straightforward than adults. It is so because when they are young they act simply, like “I want to get it so I try to get it.” Only later when they grow up, they understand that usually it’s not so easy and sometimes if you wait you get more. And it is only one of plenty details of this growing up.
 
To talk specifically about social behavior, I’ll try to compare how people act among friends. They are pretty similar to those I’ve described. The main idea is that experience gives people the understanding of social laws, so if adults live and act according to these laws of society, children with low experience act instinctively. For me being sincere looks better than lie to society and even to yourself, which is common for adults, but in other cases the laws of society are much better than instincts.
 
Instincts tell children that their purpose is survival, and they are simply not able to thing about people around them. This creates a huge problem of school bulling. I was in school and I remember how it goes, when children form groups of most similar to themselves and attack different kids. Someone can call those children angry or evil, but, apparently, they should be related as animals who are developing to become people, who are just learning life and social laws.
