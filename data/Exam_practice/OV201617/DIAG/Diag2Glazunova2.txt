There are two answers for the question "What is more important - having a job you like or earning a lot of money?". The first one is that it is better to enjoy your job and the other one is that good salary gives you more.
Firstly, it depends on your system of values. Some people believe that it is better to have an enjoyable profession, because you do not have to wait for holidays to do what you like, because you actually do it when you work. As a consequence, this person is less stressed, more satisfied with his or her life. So, it leads to happiness.
Moreover, a good salary as well as money do not play an essential role in our life. People can live with the minimum amount of things. There was a ancient philosopher called Diogenes who lived in big old broken amphora and he did not have any belongings. He did not value money as the essential part of life and he was doing great and became very famous and people respected him.
Furthermore, there are a lot of millionaires who said that they have a good life (the life that is usually called "good"), but they are not happy. The problem is that we cannot become happy only by having a lot of money, but there is something that means more. For example, modern millionaires give most of their money to charity organisations and life a simple life without gold houses and other things like this.
All thing considered, it is more important to have an enjoyable job and be happy with what you do and a good salary in not the purpose but the pleasant addition to the life of happy person.
