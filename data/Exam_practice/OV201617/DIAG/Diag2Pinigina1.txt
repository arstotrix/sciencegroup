The graph provides information about the popularity of different regions of the world as touristic places with regard to the period of time since 1990 to 2005.

According to the graph, over the 20-year period North America was the most popular region for tourists. By 2005 a rate of international tourist arrivals in Central and Eastern Europe had considerably increased at 90 million, which is similar to North America's rate. South-East Asia takes a middle position and its best result is 50 million by 2005. Sub-Saharan Africa and South America are the most unpopular regions for tourists and the first one is a little more likely to visit than the second one.


A more detailed look at the graph reveals that North America was not always such interesting for foreigners and over the period 2000 to 2005 the interest of international tourists to it was decreasing. Central and Eastern Europe has significant increase since 1990. So, possibly, after 2005 it can be much more popular than North America.
