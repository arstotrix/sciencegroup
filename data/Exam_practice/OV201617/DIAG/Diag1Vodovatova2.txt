Writing Task 2.
	Nowadays we live in a world where technology is irreplaceable We cannot exist without our cellphones or laptops. Everything can be obtained whether it is information or a piece of clothes. However, is this acquisition a good thing or a bad one?
	In my opinion, the Internet is the most useful invention ever. Not only does it connect people and give an opportunity to find friends, it also is a great source of information. First of all, you can always find answers about every question that interests you. You can find clues that will help you write your homework or some useful tips to finish your article. Second of all, it is much easier to find out about current events from the Internet rather than from a newspaper. It tends to be corrupt and often you receive a one-way opinion, whereas on the Internet you can get a wide range of opinions and you can make your own conclusions.
	However, there are a lot of people who argue that the Internet can be an unreliable source of information. They say that because there is a lot of information, sometimes it is hard to identify the “correct” one, the true one. It confuses people and because of the, som of us start to believe in something that is not true.
	All in all, the Internet has its advantages and disadvantages. Nevertheless, people need to learn how to filter the information they receive. That way no one will have a problem with finding things out from the Internet.
