The graph shows data about the number of tourists in different countries in the period from 1990 to 2005.
The countries share a common tendency: the levels of tourists’ number have increased over the period. The most popular country for spending holidays is North America. The figures had increased by 20 million in the period from 1990 to 2000 and after that remained stable till 2005. Central and Eastern Europe showed even more incredible jump: the tourist arrivals grew from 30 to 90 million over the period. The level of tourist in South-East Asia had started at 20 million and had reached 50 million by 2005. Sub-Saharan Africa and South America look almost the same: they both had only about 9 million of tourists at the start, but by 2005 Sub-Saharan Africa’s number of tourist arrivals had increased to approximately 25 and South America had stopped at almost 18. 
A more detailed look at the graph reveals that Central and Eastern Europe showed the most extreme change by 60 million. South-East Asia’s change is twice lower – 30 million. In the third place is North America with a 20 million difference. It is followed by Sub-Saharan Africa with an increase by about 16 million. The last one is South America which had only an approximately 6 million difference. 
Clearly, there is a similar trend for all the countries over this period, but the change in the number of international tourist arrivals differed for them.
