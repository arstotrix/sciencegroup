	The graph we can see shows the number of international tourist arrivals in the several parts of the world. There are North America, Central and Eastern Europe, South-East Asia, Sub-Saharan  Africa and South America.
	The data illustrated comes from 1990, 1995, 2000 and 2005 years. The common feature for all the regions is that the number in 2005 is bigger than in 1990. But the changes in South America and in Sub-Saharan Africa are not very large, near ten millions of tourists from 10 to 20 millions. The development in South-East Asia is three times as much as in those regions. It is from 20 millions to 50. But the increasing of Central and Eastern Europe is the biggest one in the graph, from 30 to nearly 90 millions. The grade of 60 millions reached in 1995 and 70 millions in 2000. The amount of tourist arrivals in North America is the biggest one in all the years (in the area of 70-90 millions). But this is this region is the only one which have a decreasing, but it is rather small, in 2000â€™s.
	To sum up, the number of tourists grown for all over the world during the fifteen years from 1990 to 2005. And the development of tourism in Europe and South-East Asia is comparatively successful.
