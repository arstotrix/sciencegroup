The diagram in the picture shows a method of leather goods producing. 
Interesting thing that we can say from this diagram is that leather travels several places before it transforms into goods. The place, where it is being collected, a factory, where it is being prepared and a fabric, where it is being used for crafting goods.
In generally, we can see that there are ten steps of producing any of leather things. In the beginning it is necessary to complete a drying process and then the skin is being transported to a factory, where it goes through the main steps. 
At first comes washing in water and lime, then soaking just in lime. After that the leather is being flattened and soaked again, but this time in water with vegetable matter liquor called “Tennin”. Next step is polishing and when all of these actions are done, prepared leather can be taken to a fabric, where the leather clothes or accessories are made.
