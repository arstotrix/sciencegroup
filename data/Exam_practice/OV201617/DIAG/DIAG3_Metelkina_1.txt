The given diagram shows the process of producing leather and leather goods. 
First, animal skin is produced and dried.  Then the skin is transported to a factory where it is washed in water with lime. After being washed the wet leather is soaked in lime liquid and then it undergoes flattening which is when the material is placed in a special pressing machine. The next step is again soaking but this time the peace of leather is put in tannin which is a mixture of water and vegetable matter. The final step of producing leather is polishing when a piece of leather is placed under a press. After this procedure the leather is ready to become a material for some sorts of goods. So it is finally transported to another factory where such goods as clothes, shoes, accessorises and toys are produced.
