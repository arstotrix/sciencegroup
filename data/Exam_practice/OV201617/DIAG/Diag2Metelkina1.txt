North America have always been the most popular direction but it did not show a significant increase and by the end of the period it even saw a slight decrease. The number of international tourists in Europe had been increasing and by the end of the period it had almoust reached the rate of North America by approximately 90 millions of people. An increase of tourists in Africa was more significant than an increase of people visiting South America even though they started at the same level in 1990.
