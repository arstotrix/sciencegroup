Nowadays, there is discussion on what quality of your job is more crucial - your interest in it or salary you get. As for myself, I tend to think that job being enjoyable is more important than well-paid. First of all, it can always be both. Even if you want the job which you think cannot bring you any reasonable profit, you can always try to find out the way to turn it profitable. For example, nowadays, there are a lot of people who just want to travel. And so many of them figured out a way to make money out of it - they became internet blogers. Another reason why I think that joy comes first while choosing a job is that we spend at work most of our time. Thus even if we have more opportunities of how to spend our free time, we have fun only at that time whether interesting job keeps us optimistic during much larger period. On the other hand, there are people who have obligations to, for example, their families. They need to choose most payable job over most enjoyable, despite the fact that they want to do something they want. My cousin's husband has been working at more than five different jobs over the past eight years (since birth of their first son) and none of them was even close to the area he is interested in. All in all, I believe that you should choose job you have interest in, however forgetting about the money at all is not a good thing.
