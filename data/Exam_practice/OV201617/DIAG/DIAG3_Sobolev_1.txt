Producing leather goods can be split up in several different stages.
First stage is comparably small than others -- it consists of drying animal skin and transporting it to a factory, which will perform next stage actions, like mastering the leather colour and appearance.

When the leather is imported to the factory, it will be washed up in water combined with lime substance, than soaked in liquid lime.
After that the leather is flattened with the help of some kind of mechanisms and put into new soaking stage, but that time with Tannin, a special material -- combination of water and vegetable matters.
Last, but not least part of this stage, excluding the transportation, is polishing the leather supported by some kind of press.

And the final stage is converting leather as material, to the ready to sell goods, like boots, bags and balls for example.
