There is no doubt, that the children’s social behavior differs from adult’s.
But what are the main features, which determines behavior of a child from behavior of an adult?
Basically, children are considered to act and react more easily in some kinds of situation. For example, they are usually free to talk with strangers, to make some new friends. They laugh when they see something funny, they ask questions if they don’t understand something and they don’t feel confused. 
From the other hand, children are much less experienced in the great amount of quastions. It is easier to frighten them, and, generally, they often can’t make a decision. In general, they don’t know what to do without an adult, because they lack an experience. In the streets. you won’t see an adult, who is crying or who is lost. 
To conclude, we can say, that children are more trustful in their behavior, than adults.
As time goes by, they learn to rely nor only on their parents and friends, but on theirselves too. They get through a lot of difficulties every day, but it is an essential part of life.
