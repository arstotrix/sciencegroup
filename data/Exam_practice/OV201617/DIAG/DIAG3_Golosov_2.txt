It is well known that social behavior of people depends on their age. In other words, it is obvious that children's actions in society change after the point of time when they become adults. It is also important to estimate the changes understanding whether each of them is a benefit or not.
As for me, I suppose that adults have better society habits than children do. Firstly, they could control their actions better: they would not laugh at other people, cry and shout at their relatives in public places as children often do. However, I should admit that this control does not mean that people become less violent after ages. Secondly, adults understand the level of responsibility which they have to bear. For example, such things as a job, children or social aims should not be regardless for people who are more than 18 years old. Thirdly, adults have more life experience than young people do. Thus, they could predict some situations occurring in society with a higher number of accuracy and plan their own actions according to their expectations. Furthermore, their own behavior could be an example for children, and they always can help young people with their social activities.
On the other hand, adults often lose some skills of social behavior which they had being young. For example, they become less flexible in society: children have opportunity to reorganize their system of actions, because their character has not finished its creating. Therefore it is important to take your level of understanding new features of life under control becoming older. In addition, children have more possibility to communicate with other people and make new friends, when adults usually only have a talk with their families and a couple of old friends.
To conclude, I would like to say that the question of social behavior in different ages is still open.  I think that in spite of the fact that adults are wiser than children, they should be careful about their flexibility.
