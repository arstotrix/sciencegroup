In our modern society money is considered to be crucial. Some people suppose, that the best job is the one that has a high salary. However, since the quality of human live has increased, some find the most important factor in choosing a job to be the enjoyment that a person receives from working.
The main purpose of a job is providing person's essential needs. That is why a well-paid job is considered to be the most reasonable choice. More than that, a person that has a job that is not interesting but is well-paid can receive enjoyment in his or her free time. For example, love, friends, family and hobbies could be a source of satisfaction.
However, there are some disadvantages of a job that only brings money but not happiness. A job takes up to a third of a human life. It is widely known that there are many things in our lives that depend not on the money solely. For instance, there are many people with a successful career who cannot build romantic relationships. Moreover, having a the job that does not bring enjoyment can even increase the chance of getting problems with mental health.
Overall, there can be different point of views on this topic. As for me, in the first place there is enjoyment that can be received working. It should not be forgotten, that money is only a way to reach goals in life and it should not be mistaken for a goal of life.
