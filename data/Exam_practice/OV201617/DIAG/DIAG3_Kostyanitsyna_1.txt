The diagram provides information on a method of producing leather goods.  Firstly, you have just an animal skin that in the end will be transformed into different things that we use in our everyday life.
A more detailed look on the diagram reveals that there are several stages of this process. Firstly, you have to dry an animal skin for a couple of hours, until it is completely wet. Lately, you need to send it to the factory, where it will be washed in a mixture of water and lime. Beyond lime is soaked, workers will flatten the skin with a special equipment. After that, it will be soaking in mixture called Tannin (it is water with vegetable matter) for a period of time. Eventually, it will be polished and transported to another factory, where clothes, bags and shoes will be made. 
Clearly, producing leather goods is difficult and time consuming process.
