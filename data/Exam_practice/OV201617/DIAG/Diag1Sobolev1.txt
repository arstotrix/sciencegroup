The bar chart inclined elucidates differences concerning the average percentage of courses passed in 2008 and 2012 correspondingly. The graph shows variety of disciplines â€” starting with 'Business' and ending with 'Science', in aphabetical order, apparently; a total number of subjects is 6, unrelated to each other. The pass rates are allocated to scale from 0 to 100 percents obviously.
In 2008 rates diffusion was colossal: from 4% in 'Humanities' to
70% in 'Computer Science'. Runner-up was 'Health Sciences' field of study,
with the result of 42% ratio. In the 4 years, the spread of percentages abruptly
had stayed close to the same numbers, however the extreme values of the range
had risen coherently: The least completed FoS was 'Humanities' , again, but
this time it got 14% , triplicated it's previous estimation; and the most
completed turned to 84%, 'Computer Science' major it was. Following one now
became 'Maths and Engineering' course, had been having viable 60% - very close
to 4-years old top result.
Although the extremums were ascending withal, the sequence inbetween was
changed partically. 'Business' grew from 22% and second place from the bottom
to the third position and 51%. That was the biggest shift after period of
time habituated. 'Health Science' was the only one discipline
that remained stable, but it can be considered as loss of passing capability, cause overall
level surging. 'Science' halted on the 4th, even thus its neighbours fluctuated
around.
At the end, summarized diversitifications are very uncertain, though overall
level of passing the courses increased.
