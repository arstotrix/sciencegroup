Adults’ social (and, to be more accurate, not only social) behaviour is different from young children’s behaviour in some ways.  Society requires that its adult members have special qualities letting them live in harmony and peace and to maintain the existing system.  So children have to acquire some skills and treats of character to become ‘good’ adults. And that is why the following differences appear.
Firstly, children’s social behavior is different from adults’ one in a way that they do not care about money and time as much that we do. They just enjoy being reckless and having a good time while their parents and other adults struggle to earn money and to manage their time successfully. The next difference is in making friends. For children it is quite easy to make new pals while playing in a park or in a kindergarten. On the contrary, some adults do not always know even their colleagues’ names and are generally more reserved and less eager to have new social contacts.  Moreover, adults do not play as frequently as children do. Partly it is a consequence of the first difference in the list (which was about time and the existence of some more important things to do), but this difference is also caused by the fact that adults simply do not have to play anymore as a game is a way to acquire social roles which adults are already aware of.
It is really arguable whether the changes are good or not, but as far as I am concerned, they are a sad but unavoidable part of growing up and becoming a mature member of society. Maybe it would be useful for adults to act like children sometimes to make their life more happy.
