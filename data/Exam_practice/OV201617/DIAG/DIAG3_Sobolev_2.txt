The topic of children becoming adults, and following changes in their socialization processes is requiring some neat in-depth analysis.
There are several reasons of the fact that it's not quite comprehensive concept.
The main is the fact, that self realization is often too fast of concrete individual, so the social behaviour is walking in some kind of avant-garde, while general behaviour is not changed at all.

It's all starts with the formulation of idealized concept of being adult.
After that concept, and some tries of the child to make himself or herself look older, which are frequently failed, the real maturing is happened, usually not noticed by the person him- or herself.
And finally general concept of being adult is coming to one's mind, often much more realistic than the first one in childhood.

Some more noticeable, and thence more often used in adulthood concept -- for example, obscene lexicon, some rude types of talking between people and so on and so forth.
And some more deep, and gotten usually with the general adulthood self esteem, like concepts of getting something, work in group rules, and things like this.
Concept of needs is pretty different between two stages, because when you're a child, adults are providing you.
But in the adulthood it's very different, exchange type of behaviour is learnt, so you have to do something to get something.

To sum all information up, i want to say, that adultness is one of the most misunderstood concept on Earth, because it's very different on surface and in depth of.
