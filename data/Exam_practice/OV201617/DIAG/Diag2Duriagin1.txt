The chart that is given illustrates the situation around tourism in the world.
As can be seen on the graph, it gives information in the period of time from 1990 to 2005 
about five regions: South America, North America, Sub-Saharan Africa, Central and Eastern Europe and South-East Asia.
Talking about the Asian and the European parts of the continent, it is obvious from the chart that both of them had an upward tendency. However, while tourist
arrivals to Asia were growing monotonously, arrivals to Central and Eastern Europe were rising very quickly,
so that in 2005 the total number of tourists in Europe was about 80 millions.
Another comparison can be made between Africa and South America. It is possible to notice that both regions had positive trend to rise from 10 millions of tourists in 1990 to more than 20 millions in 2005 in Africa. South America's rise was a little bit lower - about 15 millions of people travelling to this region in 2005.
At the end it is important to say, that, relating to the information given on the graph, the number of tourists travelling to North America was constantly growing from 1990 to 2000 and remained stable at the range between 80 and 90 millions for the last five years given.
