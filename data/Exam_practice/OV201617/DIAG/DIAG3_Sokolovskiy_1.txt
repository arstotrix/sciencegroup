The given diagram shows us the process of preparation leather for goods production. Although, many people understand that leather is animal skin, not all of them can guess how the transformation happens. The diagram has eleven stages. At first animal skin is gathered, dried and delivered to a special leather Factory, where it is starts being processed. After washing it is soaked first time in a special mixture of water and vegetable matter, then in is flattered in a huge machine and then soaked in Lime. These complicated things are necessary to make leather soft and smooth but strong. And after that the only thing left is to polish prepared leather and then it becomes ready to take part in production. So last two stages are delivering to good factories and producing leather stuff. Thus the main conclusion I make is that different common processes are often much more interesting inside.
