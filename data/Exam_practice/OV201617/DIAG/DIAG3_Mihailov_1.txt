The whole process of leather goods production consists of three large arbitrarily chosen stages. The second stage is described with most details, since the first stage is quite trivial and the last stage is too hard to generalize. 
Firstly, animal skin is dried. Then itâ€™s transported to the factory, where the second stage of production takes place.
That is the processing of leather with use of different fluids, such as water with lime or solely lime or tannin, which is actually water combined with vegetable matter. These are used for washing the skin, softening it and deepening its color, respectively. Before the latter part of the production the leather must be flattened on special machines. After, that, concluding the second stage, leather is polished again with certain machines.
Then the leather is transported to textile factories where the goods are produced out of it. And finally, the goods are ready for everyday use.
