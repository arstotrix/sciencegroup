This graph shows how the international tourists arrivals changed since 1990 to 2005 in different countries. The data used in this research was published in 2008.	
As we can see, there is a growth of the arrivals amount in all states that are comparing on this graph. 
The largest increase of arrivals is in Central and Eastern Europe: over the fifteen years the amount of tourists has been growing from 30 millions in 1990 to its peak of 90 millions people in 2005. 
In Sub-Saharan Africa and in South America lines remained nearly at the same point. 
North America was the most popular place to visit in 1990 and in 2005 it still had its place. The peak of the popularity was in 2000 with the point at over 90 million people.
South-East Asia is the third most popular country to visit. By 2005 its arrivals amount has reached nearly 50 million people, that is bigger than even Europe had in 1990.
