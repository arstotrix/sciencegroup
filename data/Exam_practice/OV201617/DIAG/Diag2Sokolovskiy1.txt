The given graph shows, how many international tourists visited different parts of the world from 1990 to 2005. The main detail which is evident from the first look is that this amount was constantly growing almost everywhere. The only exception is the amount of international tourists in in North America which slightly decreased in the beginning of the twenty first century.

Of course, the changing of the number of tourists goes differently in different countries. The most rapid growth happened in Central and Eastern Europe where at the end of the period the number of tourists was almost as high as in North America, about 90 million.
The graphs for Sub-Saharan Africa and South America are similar and the much more stable. Both had less than 10 million tourist arrivals in 1990, and both had about 20 million in 2005. To be honest, Sub-Saharan graph grew a bit faster, but they are still similar.

So, as I've already said, the tendency is the same everywhere. The amount of international tourists grows in the whole world and this is a pretty positive but not a surprising fact.
