It is arguable that an enjoyable job is more important than a good salary. Some people agree with this statement, while other people do not. 

From my point of view, a good salary does mean a lot. One of the most important features of  modern life is that everyone needs money to have a good life. The food and rent cost  a lot, especially if a man lives in a big city. If a person could not afford himself or herself such simple things as food or clothes, he or she would not survive. A person with a high-payed job also can travel a lot, buy expensive clothes and furniture, in other words, he or she can have a glamorous life, which is, according to the standarts of modern world, is prestigious. A good salary means that a person has a high status in society. 

It is necessary to say that doing something enjoyable is improtant, too. Nowadays adults spend most of their time, working. 40 hours per week they are obliged to achieve some goals, because they do have duties. To my mind, it takes too much time every day. If people do not enjoy the process of working, they are always in a bad mood. The consequences of a permanent bad mood might be awful, for example a dipression or some problems with health. I think that if person has a happy life, the duration of their life is supposed to be longer. Is not is the one and only thing to live for? Happiness, but not money, is the key to a good life. 

Finally, I want to say that everybody has a choise whether to have a high-payed or an enjoyable job. There are as many advantages, as many disadvantages ib both of the variants. That choice is a hundred percent personal.
