Writing Task 1.
	Nowadays for a lot of people, cars are the only way of commuting to work or traveling. In the United Kingdom people with low-income spend about 2% of their income on petrol, whereas people in the United States tend to spend almost 5,5% of their income on gas. This significant difference can maybe demonstrate that petrol in the US is more e[pensive that in the UK. Perhaps it also demonstrates that people in the UK do not have cars if they have a low-income.
	Another difference is that people in the UK who have middle-income spend 3,5% of their salary on petrol, whereas people in the US spend almost 4,5%.
	However, one thing that both of these countries have in common is that people with high-income spend 4% of their wage on petrol. Although the percentage of the amount people in the UK spend on petrol is a little bit higher that in the US. This can mean that for rich people the cost of petrol is not high and it does not make much difference on their salary.
