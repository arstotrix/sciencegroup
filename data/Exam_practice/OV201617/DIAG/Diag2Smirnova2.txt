Nowadays it is a common thing to say that money is a more important aspect of any kind of job than the pleasure.
People who think like this claim that even you hate what you are doing every day you still can be happy, if you have enough money. On the one hand, I can agree with them.
Definitely, money makes lots of things easier and more enjoyable for you. For example, if you have a nice salary, you will be able to try lots of activities that will bring you joy, you will be able to buy different things that you want, you will travel to the places that might bring you happiness.
The  only question is if it is enough. Some people would say that job it is just the way to earn money and you don’t have to like at all. It may be true but only to a certain extent. For example, I know for sure that I would try my best  to find the job that I would first of all actually like. I think the most amazing feeling is when you know that you do something right, something that other people need. If you can do it and still get some money – that is the best thing in the world, in my opinion. There are plenty of people who don’t earn as much money as managers, for example, but they still work as doctors and teachers and they will not change this job for anything just because of the fact that it gives them the reason to wake up in the morning and gives them a lot of joy every single day. 
To my mind, these people are much happier than the ones who do their job only because they need to. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that every person has a right to its own opinion and can look for a job without thinking whether he or she likes it or not, although I may not agree with them. It is a very controversial question which needs careful consideration.
