The problem of  a job is very important nowadays. A lot of people think that it is more important to be rich than to enjoy working. However, another people think that one should prefer some interesting job to the other.
As for me, I support the second point of view. First of all, an enjoyable job should give you more positive feelings. This is very important for health and psychology. Furthermore, it is always less difficult to have a result of work you enjoy doing than to try dealing with some problems which make you feel exhausted. Finally, spending time on your favorite work could help you to avoid conflicts in your family. Thus, you could get such a large number of different positive emotions that it would help you to solve all problems with your relatives.
On the other hand, there are some arguments for the opposite point of view. To begin with, money play an important role in our live. For example, we should pay for such things as meal, place to live and studying. Moreover, there are a lot of situations when we have to collect large sum of money. For instance, if some person needs a diffcult operation, it is usually very expensive to organize. Thus, the problem of money is relevant for our health. Additionally, some people could have children, which usulally do not work anywhere, and parents should provide them with their needs. 
In conclusion I would like to say that the question of financial status is still open. I think that personal interests should be more important factor in making a choice of one's job than financial success. However, salary should be high enough to deal with problems of living.
