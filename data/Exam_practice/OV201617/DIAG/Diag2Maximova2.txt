The discussion of whether a well-paid job is better than one that you like is a long-going one. Each point of view has its supporters and its own strong argument. Let us take a closer look at both sides.
On the one hand, those who support an enjoyable job claim that it is important to like what you do on a daily basis; otherwise it will be a disaster. Of course, the results will be better if you work with something you like. Secondly, there is a well-known saying that if you choose a job you love, you will not have to work a single day in your life. Jobs take a great part of our daily routine, and this routine would better be pleasant. If it is not, the consequences can vary from job-hopping (changing your job very often) to serious psychological issues.
On the other hand, money is also an important issue. It is hard to imagine our everyday life without buying and selling anything. Having a good salary means that you can afford yourself a comfortable life with all the conveniences you need. It also means that you should not create additional psychological pressure for yourself in order to making your ends meet. Furthermore, high salary creates a valuable social status, which also guarantees some comfort in our society.
All in all, I suggest that each side has its own advantages and disadvantages. As for me, I would choose a well-paid job which would be corresponded with things I like and which would give me the opportunity and free time for my hobbies. Finding balance is of utter importance for everything, and finding a job is not as exception.
