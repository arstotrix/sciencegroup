The given graph shows information about the amount of international tourists arrived in different parts of the world during the period from 1990 to 2005.
By 2005 tourists' interest in visiting all parts of the world (except North America) has significantly increased, whereas North America became less popular.

In 1990's people in general did not show much interest in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa: these parts of the world were visited by less than 10 millions of tourists in 1990. South-East Asia was not much attractive for visitors either: it was explored only by 20 millions. But by 2005 the amount of international tourists has increased to approximately 15 millions in case of South America, to 20 millions in case of Sub-Saharan Africa and to 45 millions in case of South-East Asia. In sharp contrast with this comparably slight growth, the number of people interested in Central and Eastern Europe has surprisingly risen from about a 30 millions of tourists in 1990 to 85 millions in 2005. But, according to the data, in the same time people began to lose interest in North America: despite the steady rise of the number of visitors during the last decade of 20th century, the amount of tourists has started to slightly decline after reaching its peak in 2000.

In general, the given graph illustrates the tourist' increasing interest in exploring the less popular parts of the world.
