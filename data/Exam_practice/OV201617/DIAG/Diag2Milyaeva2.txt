Nowadays we need money everywhere and to earn it we get a job. The criterions when choosing the business of life can be different: some people look on their interests and hobbies, others prefer higher salaries. But which of this ways is the best?
On the one hand, money is very important. It can help to get anything we want, go anywhere. It gives us total freedom. So high salary is very important. Everyone wants to make their dreams come true, that is why many people understand that their job should be well-paid. 
On the other hand, money is not everything. To earn the high salary we should work hard, what is difficult if we do not like our job. Everyday routine can be very annoying, can lead to depressions even if it brings money. Than it is very difficult to say, that money brings happiness.
What is more, if you like your job, if it is really interesting for you, you will become a very good specialist. The process of work will be a pleasure for you even if it is hard and the quality of it will be high, so the salary will rise. Finally, in this case you will get an interesting job with a high salary, what will exactly bring you happiness.
All in all, I want to say, that money is important and people, who think more about their salaries than about interests, are right. However, it is much better to get a job, which you really like, and than your salary will become appropriate one day.
