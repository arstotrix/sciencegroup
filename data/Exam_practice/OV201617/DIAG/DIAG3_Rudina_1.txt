The given diagram shows stages of producing leather goods. Overall, the process of producing can be divided into 3 groups: drying of animal skin, its dispatching and a primary preparation before it becomes a real material for producing; a secondary stage and all steps to make leather more convenient and suitable for factory needs; its delivery to another factory and the result is leather goods. 
Now we can return to the second stage, which is described in details. Overall, there are five stages of skin preparation for goods production: washing, soaking in two different moistures, flattening and polishing. Flattening and polishing are automatically processed.  There are three stages with water. First of all, skin is been washed in a mist, where water and lime are mixed. The next water stage is soaking in lime. There is a process of flattening, making by some mechanism, between the second and the third stage. As for the third stage, skin is left soaking again in vegetable manner mixed with water. The stage of skin polishing is the last one before dispatching prepared material at a factory, where animal skin turns into, for example, bags, shoes or sport stuff.
To sum up, the whole process is really complex, so we discussed the first and the last stages in general and paid more attention to the second one, which is connected with static washing and soaking and water and dynamic flattening and polishing by mechanisms.
