The presented scheme shows the stages of leather goods producing. With some pictures, it is described on the diagram. First, the producers dry animal skin and transport it to the factory, where it has to be washed in limed water and then soaked. After this, the skin is flattened in special sort of a mechanism. The next stage is soaking: the skin is plunged in so called ‘tannin’ which represents water and vegetable matter. After soaking, producers polish the skin and transport in to other factories where the process of different leather goods production passes. The production is very different; we use it every day and for many different reasons: accessories, shoes, sport equipment etc.
