The graph showes how many international tourists visited different parts of the world from 1990 to 2005.
The most increases we can see in a level of tourism in Central and eastern Europe - the figure had grown from 30 millions visiters to three times by 2005 and became almost equal to the level of tourism in North America, while amont of international tourists in South America and Sub-Saharan Africa rises less than on 10 millions. All areas besides North America shows a stedy rise of the tourism over the all period, and in North America there is a little decrease in numbers from 2000 to 2005. Neverthless, by 2005 North America stays the most popular part of world for visiting, while the most unpopular one changes from Sub-Saharan Africa to South America. 
In the end we can assume that comparising the period from 1990 to 2005 tourism has became more popular in general through all parts of the world given in this graph.
