During the development of a person from a child to an adult, some changes occur in their behavioral patterns.
The most basic change would be caused by the obvious difference in the needs their having as a child and as a grown-up. The first one’s needs could be motivated either by their biology, for example, if a child wants to eat it will start showing signals indicating this until the need is satisfied, or they could be motivated socially but in a more simple egocentric way, for instance, if a child doesn’t like some other child, the former will likely resist any kind of interaction with the latter by crying, screaming, biting, etc. But as a person develops, they learn to take part in social interactions even with the most unappealing characters, if such an interaction is necessary for some greater cause. Again, the more biological needs are often ignored by adults for the same greater cause. Take laziness for example. A proper member of society won’t spend their evening by a TV, when there’s work which must be done, no matter how boring this work is for this person. In general, this change could probably be called social responsibility.
Whether this change is good or not isn’t a very correct question. This change is necessary, if adults were to behave as children in society, then no society could exist. On the other hand, such a high level of social responsibility isn’t needed for the child, because the main social obligations are usually performed by its parents, so that it could have a worriless childhood.
To summarize, the main change in the social behavior of a child and an adult is their level of social responsibility, which certainly must raise with age but is also not so important in the childhood.
