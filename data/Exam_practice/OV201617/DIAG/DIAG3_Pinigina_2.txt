The social adaptation is a really important process. Someone’s behaviour in his or her childhood and in adult life can be different and the main reasons of these changes often are the consequences of the social adaptation. So what do the differences between children’s social behaviour and that of adults look like? Do they take place good? I am not sure.
It is known that children trust other people much more than adults. It can be explained by their not-having any life experience or just their extra kindness but, nevertheless, they feel better than adults and, clearly, they are much more honest by themselves and can be trusted.
What is more, children are always explorers and dreamers. The childhood is time of adventures and big plans for future. Unfortunately, adults have much more responsibilities, for instance, earning money for their families, that kills their ability to dream about something more and makes them to satisfy by inevitable, but unimportant things.
However, there are many examples of people whose childhood was not a really comfortable period for them. They used to be shy and did not use to communicate with their classmates, etc. In spite of their character, now they are successful thankfully opportunities given by age and social adaptation.
It can be also said that adult people are more responsible and can remember their promises. In the other side, it is not true that they do it.
To conclude, I want to declare my opinion and say that children’s social behaviour differs from that of adults and, unfortunately, it does not take place good. However, nothing can stop adults to save their childhood with its dreams and kindness in their souls.
