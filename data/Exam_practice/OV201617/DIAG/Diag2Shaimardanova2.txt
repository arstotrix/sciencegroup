There is a really hard questions: Which job give us more benefits and satisfactions: job with enjoable day routine or which give a lot of money? I would like to show all sides of this questions.
	First of all, most of workers have a famile with more than two children. Because of this, adult-workers should spend bigger piace of money on aducation, clothers (because children are growing up repidly), extra curses, toys and other things. Unfortunatelly, this is a really big price. Secondly, for the confident in the our future, we should know, than out last years of life will be un. Moreover, the prices for electric produse, rent of earth, taxes and other have a upward treand. Because of this, people should be ready for this.
	On the other hand, if person do not have the mood or satisfaction, then there are no satisfaction of money. Of course, this person can buy fast everything what he want, but his dailly rutine will kill all of positive moments of life and change it on the greas and unenjoyable work-days. Together with this, enjoyable job makes us full of energy for disocering new ways of life. So, we are ready to starting some new kinds of work, job, hobbys, extra job for the more money etc. 
	After all facts, i have a suggest that the job of dreams should give us sutisfaction together with few money. However, this is less important for me to earning enormous money, because i doubt, that we can not earn all money in the world.
	However, this question are still have not decided, because every person have the compleatly different opinion, compleatly different life and purpuses.
