 Many people are sure that today it is very important to pay attention on changes in kids' behaviour. A lot of people think that when kids grow up and become adult ones, their behaviour changes. It is possible because in the adult life person are pressured by many factors such as a bad people or high sense of responsibility that is why their social behaviour might be changed. Some people have different point of view and say that such things as behaviour in social are not depend on the age. I personally think that social behavour of a person changes somehow when he or she grows up.
On the one hand, an adult or a real life includes a lot of difficalties such as bad people around. For  example, I have a friend who was very selfich and childish, and did never use bad words towards his friends and relatives. But when he moved to university in Moscow and made new friends in the dormitary, his behaviour changes and after a year of such a life nobody can say that he was still a child because of how he behaved. Besides, adults can not be as fluffy as children and have to be able to protect themselves meanwhile children usually know that they are saved. That is why, from my point of view, when person grow up, he or she become more agressive.
On the other hand, a lot of depends of bringing up. If a kid knows that he or she should be polite, this person will be polite always, in 3 and in 70 years. Moreover, if a person would change their behaviour too much and becomes angry or sad, each person has frieds and relatives who would obligatory improve the situation. For instance, when the friend of mine stars to offend everyone by rude words, her family and her friends ask her to stop.
To sum up, I reckon that it is likely to change social behaviour then one become adult.
