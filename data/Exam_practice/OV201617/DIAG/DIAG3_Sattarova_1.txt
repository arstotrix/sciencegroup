The diagram gives us information about producing leather goods step by step from animal skin to things we use in everyday life. First of all, animal skin is being dried. After drying process skin is being delivered to factory. There dried skin is being washed by the mixture of water and lime in special bath. Then in similar bath it is being soaked with lime. Next process of producing of leather is flattening, which is made by special equipment. Then again there is the process of soaking in bath. However, this time it is not with lime but with tannin. Tannin is a special mixture of water and vegetable matter. After the second soaking material is polished by polishing machine. This is the last process in a factory of producing leather.
