On the diagram we can see the scheme illustrating the process of producting of leather goods.
All leather goods are made from the animal skin. First of all it should be dried and then it is transported to a factory. There the skin goes through a several stages. The first stage is washing. The skin is washed in the water with lime. Then it keep soaking in the mixture consisting of lime. Before soaking again it is flattened in the special machine with two round tube wich press the skin between them. Then it is soaking again in tannin, wich is the watter with vegetable matter. Finally it is polishing by the special device. So there the skin is prepared to the producing of the goods, so it is transported to another factory where the goods are made from this skin.
So we can see that the process consist of three major part wich is: drying, preparing and producing the goods. On the diagram the second part is more highly detaled than other.
