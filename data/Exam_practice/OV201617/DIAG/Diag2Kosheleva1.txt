Whether number of people who came to Europe in 2005 is about 60 millions bigger than it was in 1990, in other parts of the world it had not changed more than for 40 millions. During the first half of nineties rise of numbers was fast in Europe,then it slowed for a little and then gained almost the same speed in 2000 as it had before, and reached a number of 90 millions of tourists by 2005. Until 1995 figures of both Sub-Saharian Africa and South America were quite the same, however in 1995 pace went down a bit for South America, whether it grew up for Sub-Saharian Africa a little in 2000. North America had more than twice an amount of tourists coming to Europe, about 70 millions, and it also had a steady growth until 2000,  but unlike others it has a slight decrease of popularity since 2000.
