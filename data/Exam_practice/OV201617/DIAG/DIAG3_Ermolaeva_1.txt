The supplied flow chart represents data on the whole process of production of leather goods.
To begin with, the animal skin that will be used for the subsequent producing is dried up. After this stage, the material is delivered directly to the factory, where it is washed in the special substance, comprising water and lime. Next, the animal skin is soaked only in lime and then it is put into special vehicle in order to be flattened. In the subsequent step the material is soaked again, but in the mixture of water and vegetable matter. At the further stage this skin is polished with the help of specialized machine. Eventually, this prepared material is delivered into another factory, where various leather goods are produced from this skin.
Overall, the manufacturing process consists of eleven stages, beginning with the drying of the skin and coming to an end with finished products.
