The diagram below displays the process of producing the leather goods.
First of all, the animal skin has to be dry, before it can be driven by the truck to the factory. It hangs on some kind of a branch and gets blowdried. After it arrives on the factory it gets washed in water with lime in it. Then it has to soak in that same lime before it gets flattened in the special machine. After that, the skin has to get tanned in water mixed with vegetable matter. The skin is left for some time to soak in that water. The next step is to polish the skin automatically before it gets into the truck and the truck goes to another factory, where the actual goods are being made. 
As you can see, there are a lot of different steps before we can get our hands on handbags or shoes made of leather.
