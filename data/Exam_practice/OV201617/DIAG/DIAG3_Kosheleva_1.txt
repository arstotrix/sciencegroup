This diagram describes path of leather from being just an animal skin to becoming a final product. At the beginning, animal skin is drying on the wind. After that, it is being delivered to the factory where it will be prepared for further use. First of all, it is being washed in a mixture of water and lime, after that it is spends some time in lime. After soaking, special machines (these machines are built as a combination of one big and one small cylinder, the skin goes between them) flatten the skin. Than the skin soaks for the second time, this time in tannin, this is a mixture of water and vegetable matter.  In the end, the skin is being polished and, finally, delivered to the factories which will produce goods (such as shoes, bags, sports equipment, etc.) out of it.
