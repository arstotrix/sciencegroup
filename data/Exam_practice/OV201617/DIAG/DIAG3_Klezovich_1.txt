The given graph introduces information on the process of making products from leather from scratch at the manufacture.
There are two main stages of this process: production of leather itself and afterwards manufacturing products for the market from this material. Also these two stages are held at the different factories.
Firstly, dryed animal skin is transported to the factory. At the factory this skin is washed with the help of water and lime. After washing skin is soaking in the tannin, which is liquid with a vegetable matter. Then it is flattered. At the next step it has to soak again, but compared to the previous soaking now this process is held in the lime water. Then skin finally turns into leather through a polishing process.
Secondly, produced leather is transported to another manufacture, where plenty of goods like shoes, bags and etc. are made from it. That is how leather products are made stage by stage.
