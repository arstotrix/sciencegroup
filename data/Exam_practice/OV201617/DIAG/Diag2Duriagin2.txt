Nowadays, there is an ongoing debate on the topic:What leads to a better life: the importance of having an enjoyable working environment or having a high salary? There are both views on this question.
On the one hand, having a job that provides you with a great amount of money gives you a wide range of possibilities. For example, you can afford high-class flights for vacation, a big and rich house full of different furniture and anything you want. However, this job might be either boring, either bring you a lot of stress, or your work’ responsibilities might not satisfy you as well for some other reason. Although the job you are doing may not fit you, all the other moments apart from work will be full of exciting things. So, to some extent money is a way to reach some kind of happiness and well-being.
On the other hand, you can fulfill your whole life with pleasure and joy if you are doing a job that brings happiness and attending which you feel yourself comfortable. There are things beside the money you make, which are much more important – doing whatever you like in life. And this also may include the work.
In conclusion, as for me, I think that by having just a lot of money you cannot live a better life – it cannot lead to happiness . People are spending most of their life at work, so why not making this part enjoyable as well?
