The diagram illustrates the process of producing goods made of leather.
First of all, wet animal skin is hanged in order to make it dry. Then it is collected and transported to a special factory where the skin is put into a box with mixture of water and lime juice. There the skin is washed from dust. Then it is put into another box with lime juice where it is soaking. Later the skin is flattened and put into a box with tannin which is made of water and vegetable matter. The skin is soaking again there. Eventually the skin is polished under a press and is delivered to another factory where different goods of leather such as shoes, bags and balls are made.
Clearly, if it had not taken this long procedure consisted of many phases, it would not have become a good material for various types of products.
