Every adult in the world used to be a child. Almost all of us had changed our social behavior since childhood. Were these changes more for good or for worse?
I believe that the main loss, that a lot of people experience, is becoming less open to the world. Children, in general, think less of other people’s opinions about them. If they want to do something (even if others are not doing it), they most probably will. The adults, otherwise, tend to think of everything they do or tell in perspective of what others would say about it. For example, when I was little, I was very comfortable asking questions. If I need to know something why not ask? However, nowadays before I ask a question, I would think of many things, such as: maybe everyone knows it and it is stupid to ask? Maybe this person is already annoyed with me? Maybe it is inappropriate in some other way? This kind of self-doubt is very annoying and depressing, so, in this matter, it was much better being a child.
The other sad thing is that there is much less people who you consider to be your friends and they think the same about you. The main problem is time. It is not very often that friends work together (if they hadn’t become friends at work, of course), so it is logical that they will not spend much time together.
However, there are some good sides of being an adult. For example, there is a higher chance that your words or actions will be taken seriously or have less attention. My nephew sometimes has very interesting ideas, but, unfortunately, my sister, his mother, do not listen to him very carefully because she thinks that he is too young.
All in all, there are good sides in every age period and people should take the most from it.
