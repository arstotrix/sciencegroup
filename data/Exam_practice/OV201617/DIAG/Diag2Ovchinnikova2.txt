By way of introduction I would like to undescore that my standpoint is subjective and a lot of people can not argue with me. 
Would the job give you a good salary or the happiness is enough? Some people consider that the answer is apparent and only favourite job can make you happy. However, their opponents approve that even prestige is better. Let's try to understand.
Firstly, when you have a loved work you want to do increasingly task. That increases your operability and it makes you fell a self-confidence.
Secondly, when you perform favourite job you are better socialised and have a good self-realisation In addition, the real relationship such as deep love, friendship and respect are not bought with money.
However, thanks to the good salary you be able to travel in different countries and open a lot of new things to yourself. A lot of possibilities are opened due to money.
Unfortunately but it is truth, the social status and quantity of friends depend on your financial situation.
I would rather have a good salary. I'm going to provide partially my parents and my family. I want to live in megalopolis, so it is an important thing to me.
To sum it up, I say that everyone must decide for itself and make a heavy choice, because it will have an impact for all your life.
