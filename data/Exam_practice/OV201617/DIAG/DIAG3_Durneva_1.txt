The diagram given illustrates the process of leather goods production.  It consists of seven stages.
In the beginning, animal skin is dried. After that, it is taken to the factory, where the process of begins. There, it is being washed with lime mixed with water. However, after that it is being left soaking just lime without water. Next, the material has to pass the stage of flattening in the special machines. After being flattened, the skin is put into the liquid for soaking again. Unlike  the first soaking and washing, in this stage the mix which is called “tannin” is used. It consists of water and vegetable matter. The next stage is polishing. This is the final stage, after which the skin is ready to be taken to another factory where it will be made into leather goods such as shoes of different kinds, bags as well as equipment for sporting games.
