It is true that most people can change completely while they are growing up. It is believed that kids and adults behave in society in different ways, while I highly agree with this statement. 
In my opinion, there are several differences. Firstly, the way that we express our feelings.  Children at that young age do not understand exactly what they feel. Thus, they have a range of things that they can do to show someone their interest, for example, a child can bite you or name you with a bad word. Otherwise, an adult will never do something like that to his soul mate. He will ask you for a date, for example. Secondly, it is quite impossible for an adult to be very open with a new person. We do not want somebody to know our secrets; we do not trust each other because we know that not everyone is a good person. Conversely, children have not had enough bad experience to be scared of people. They feel like every stranger that they meet on the streets is their friend or relative. So, the way that they behave with them is completely different from the same process with adults.  
In conclusion, I would like to stress that these changes has more pros than cons. Personally, I think that the way that adults behave should not be considered as a bad thing.  It illustrates what you have learned from the experience that you had because while you growing up, you have to face with many difficulties that can influence you in different ways.
