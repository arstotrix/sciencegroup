Nowadays money is playing much more important role than it used to before. That is why people are trying to find a place with a better salary often not even thinking about the pleasure they should find in it. For some people an amount of money they are given is the main question. For others having the job of their dreams is essential and they do not want to think about how much they earn.
As far as I am concerned, a person should love his or her job because it can bring a copious amount of benefits. Firstly, a worker with a desire is able to do the tasks better and more accurate than the one who do it just like a duty. The former will not consider the thing that he or she does as everyday routine. Moreover, one who do enjoy his or her occupation is promoted more rapidly. A person puts his or her heart and soul into a job, so there is no doubt that an employer can rely on a worker. Besides, the surveys show that people who love the way they do for a living suffer less from various diseases.
However, there are a great number of people who work just for money. First of all, in most cases people have to do the work which is paid better because they have families, children to bring up, parents to help and other things that requires a plenty of money.  Secondly, for some people earning money is the only way to spend their lives. Other things have no sense to them. They quitted their dream jobs to become rich and wealthy.
To sum up I would like to empathize that the amount of money should not become the meaning of personâ€™s life. Doing the things he or she likes brings much more happiness and within time the one will be able to earn as much money as he or she deserves.
