The graph shows how many tourists arrived in different world regions from 1990 to 2005.
All five parts of the world show the same trend - in general the number of tourist arrivals increased in every region, comparing 1990 and 2005. The region named "Central and Eastern Europe" shows the most significant rise from just over 30 million to just under 90 million. This number almost became equal to the figure of the leader - North America.
A more detailed look reveals that North America is an exception from the main trend - the graph flattens out and it seems to be less number of tourist arrivals in 2005 comparing with 2000. The number of Sub-Saharan Africa rose more than the figure of South America that increased twofold from about 9 to just under 20.
Overall, the number of international tourist arrivals increased. Despite the fact that North America was a leader during this 15 years, Central and Eastern Europe showed the most significant rise, whereas other regions stood far behind.
