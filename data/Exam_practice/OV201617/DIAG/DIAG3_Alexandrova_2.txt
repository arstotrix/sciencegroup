Human beings have very complicated behaviour system, which is developing during entire life.
The main impact on how we act has our social surrounding.
It is logical that people and atmosphere around a person changes as he or she grows up.
In that case, we can confirm that children behaviour and adult behaviour are quite opposite.
These changes take place because of personal inner developing.
Adult person has bigger life experience.
He or she knows about consequences of many situations and tries to avoid them.
Responsibility for other lives and their future make more careful in social life, they have to think before doing something.
Adults have to go to work, to take care of many important things.
No time for playing, because life is not a playground, it is a wild sea of problems.
Children are explorers. 
Their field of interest includes everything in the world.
They don't ask themselves a  question "What will happen, if I do this?".
Because of this children don't care about people around.
When a child wants something, he or she spend all the power to reach the aim, even if it's impossible or hurts someone.
Many children don't know the word "no", because they don't know "why not".
Boys and girls don't think about serious problems like job, education, food supplies. 
They live in a kind of fairytale, where the biggest problem is lack of sweets in the pocket.
Even is my description of children behaviour has negative side, I absolutely don't want to make it bad.
Children egoism is not intentional, it is an eventual part of growing.
As a child becomes older, he or she learns to live in society, understands, what is good and what is bad.
This process is very difficult, and each parent has to be fully involved in it.
The behaviour changes depend on adults.
They can explain a child the rules of life, teach to be polite and kind to others.
Or the child will grow up like an angry, jealous and egoistic person.
