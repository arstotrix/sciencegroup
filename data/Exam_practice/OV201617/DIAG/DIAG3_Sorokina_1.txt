The diagram given shows us a process of producing leather goods. It can be easily seen that the main part of the process is devoted to making leather a suitable material for producing goods. Thus, the production requires five stages of the very leather producing, two factories, and two vehicles for transporting material from one factory to another. 
On the first factory preliminary dried animal skin goes through five stages of processing, which are: washing, soaking in lime, flattening, one more soaking with the use of vegetable matter, so the leather is getting tanned, and then polishing. Afterwards, the produced leather is being brought to another factory, where it is being used as material for creating (especially, sewing) goods – leather shoes, bags, balls etc. The initial process of getting skin from an animal is not shown on a diagram, though. The stage of bringing up animals is not captured, as well. 
It can be clearly seen from the diagram how complex processing of leather goods is. Obviously, it consumes a lot of time and human’s effort to produce even a single bag or a pair of shoes.
