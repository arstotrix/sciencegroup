Everybody in their life faces to the difficult choice thinking about their career. People have to decide if is it better to find pleasant or high-payed job. This question becomes even more painful during last school year when teenagers need to choose their future occupation. Thus, how can anybody decide this dilemma?
In my opinion, people should choose a job which is make them happy. It does not matter how big salary is. Firstly, if someone likes what he or she does, it would be easier to get big salary. For making great career people need to be involved in process, they should be interested in what they do, enjoy their work. This is the best way to be success - to choose work thinking not about money but about joy. Secondly, people cannot be happy doing things that do not bring them much joy. What is the point of working when you hate all of your work? Also people get a lot of stress which is not good for their health when they hate the place that they must see everyday of their life even if it is give a lot of money.
However, a lot of people think differently. They are sure that money is the most important factor during choosing the job. Firstly, a lot of our dreams people can make true only with money. For example, the adventure of the lifetime of buying a helicopter. Without dreams coming true our lives would not be happy. Secondly, often people not only live on their own but need to feed their families. 
In conclusion, everyone should choose their own way. It does not matter will be an occupation chosen because of money or because of joy. It is more important to know if is life going to be connected with much joy and happiness or not.
