As people grow up, they change their social behavior. People change their behavior less or more, otherwise, the differences between young children’s social behavior and that of adults are very easy to mark.
From my point of view, the main difference between people of different ages’ behaviour is that adults are calmer that children. People learn to response others personal space. Adults try not to disturb other people if it is possible. Children think only about themselves and try to make as much noise as they can.  For example if a kid goes to the public place, e.g. a park, he or she would think only about having fun, so that he or she would laugh loudly. In this situation an adult would try to be calm and chill, not scream, because grown up people understand that other people came into park to relax, too. 
Within ages people become more responsible and polite. These are very important qualities, which children do not have, because they think they do not need them. For example, a child does not have to apply for the job, to talk to strangers or to communicate with people he or she does not like. Adults are obliged to do all these things.  For example, if a person applies for a job and presents themselves in a bad way or if he or she is rude to other, nobody would treat you in a proper way. If you are not responsible and polite, people would not respect you, which is very important for adults. 
Finally, it is naturally that a person wants to change as he or she grows up, despite the fact that the process of growing up is hard. Adults learn how to live and how to survive in the society.
