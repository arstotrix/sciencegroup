Some say high salary to be not as essential as an actual choice of a job by interest. However, others disagree and argue that the more money you earn the better quality of life you get. But is it worth it?

To begin with, not everything on Earth can be bought for money. For instance, it is highly doubtful that it is possible to get any respect from someone just by having a certain amount of money. Thus, neither true friendship nor love can be bought for money. Moreover, a dull job obviously makes you a dull person. The thing is that any job has its appreciators and those who are indifferent to it. If you are of the second kind, you are not going to have any passion for what you do and your personality and your mind will not be enriched with your experience. Also, you may have a psychological breakdown after getting stuck with problems you are not eager to find a solution for, what is obviously harmful for your health.

On the other hand, choosing a job which you are interested in will give you a whole new experience which you will definitely have a huge benefit from. Firstly, the more you like something, the more productively you do it. Thus, you have more chances to get a promotion and improve your skills. Secondly, you will have an opportunity to find new friends among your colleagues as they will be interested in the same thing as you. What is more, as one wise man said, if you love what you do it is no longer your job.

All in all, in my opinion, it is way more important to do what you love than to earn a lots of money.
