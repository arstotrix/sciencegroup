In our word it is nessasary to have some source of money. Everybody make their living in the differnt way. Someone prefer to do job they do not really like, but by doing which they get better salary. Others believe that it is much more important to do job, which you ehjoy than to earn a lot.

In some way, it is ofcource important to earn enought to live normally, I mean to be possible to by food and other nesessary goods. Everybody learned from school about Maslou piramid of wants, where on the first pleces are food, water and safety and oly after them is art and others. Of course we know people like Van Gogh, who did not have money at all, but who contitued to do art, decause they could not imagne their lives without it. But they are outstanding people. 

But on the other hand, if we speak about situation, where you should choose betwen normaly-paid job, which you enjoy to do and a job, wich you dislike or which is hard for you to do, but wich drawns you higher salary, I thing, I would prefer the first. Because for me enjoing my doings is a crutial thing, without it I become stressed and nervous. And I believe it is the same for many others. I will not enjoy money which I get from unplesant job.

All in all, it is no doubt that money is important thing for better living. But the same I can say about plesant job, which can make you happier than a high salary.
