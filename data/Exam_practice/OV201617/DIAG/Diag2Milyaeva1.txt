The graph shows how many people visit different parts of the world and how this number was changing during the period since 1990 to 2005. 
We can see that the most popular destination in 1990 was North America, however the number of tourists in Central and Eastern Europe, which was less visited in 1990, grew during the period. So in 2005 the most visited parts of the world were North America and Central and Eastern Europe. The least popular destinations in 1990 were South America and Sub-Saharan Africa. The number of tourists in both of them grew during the period, but the rise in Sub-Saharan Africa was quite greater, so in 2005 the least popular destination was South America. We can also see the rise in the number of tourists in South-East Asia, which was visited by 20 millions of people in 1990 and 50 millions in 2005. 
All in all, the most important rise can be seen in Central and Eastern Europe and the least one in South America.
