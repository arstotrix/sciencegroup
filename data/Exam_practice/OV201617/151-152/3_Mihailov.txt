The chart demonstrates average pass rates of Year 1 undergraduates from different disciplines in years 2008 and 2012.
The first notable fact is that for Humanities only about 4 percent of students in 2008 and 14 percent in 2012 passed, which is the lowest pass rate in both years in comparison with other disciplines.
The highest result, on the other hand, is that of Computer Science students with 70 and 23 percent for years 2008 and 2012 respectively.
The biggest difference in two years’ results is for Business with a gap of about 28 percent. Math and Engineering and Science show overall equal pass rates with only difference being that the former’s result is higher by 10 percent in both years compared to the latter’s result.
The pass rate of the Health sciences students is the same in both years, remaining at approximately 42 percent.
The average dynamic for all the disciplines, except the one mentioned just above, is an increase in pass rates from 2008 to 2012
