The diagrams illustrate in steps how a headland is collapsing and what is left after this erosion. At first the waves beat on the headland and some areas of it become weak. After thousands of years, the most attacked parts of the headland open to form caves. Due to continuous wave exposure, these caves are turning into arches. The well-known arches, such as Durdle Door and Dorset, have formed having passed these stages. As the roof of the arch gradually decreases, it becomes unstable and eventually collapses under its own weight. As the result of this fall, an isolated stack has formed near the attacked headland. This stack is little by little eroded, as waves continue to weaken it. Finally, this small rock transforms into a stump. All in all, the process of headland erosion occurs extremely slowly. It will happen until all the cape has turned into the stacks.
