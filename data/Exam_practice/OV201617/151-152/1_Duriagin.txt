Nowadays, it is believed that the true idea and philosophy of sports has disappeared. This happened because of the money put in those sports.
  On the one hand, I agree with this statement. Modern world class competitions are all about the money winners get and the tickets sold to these events. Sportsmen are trying as hard as they can not for themselves, but for their sponsor contracts and cash they get, if they win. Another aspect of the problem is that many of the games, races and championships are being bought. This means that the teams or individual sportsmen get money for losing in the heat in order to let the other win.
  However, on the other hand, many people know about the problems with corruption and fight against it. There are special comitees created to control the 'fair play' in all sport leagues and championships. Moreover, the most part of the sportsmen try their best not for the money, but to prove themselves that they are the fastest or the strongest. These people will die for the true spirit of sporting competitions and they will be the true examples for the new waves of athletes.
  To sum up, I would like to sat that I partly agree with the topic. Of course, there are people who try to cheat or do anything possible to get money, but they exist in every sphere of life. The most part of sportsmen are up to the true spirit of sporting competitions and they spread this idea into masses.
