The spirit of sporting competition has been destroyed by the amount of money now assosiated with most sports.

   When I was at school, many of my classmates wanted to be athletes. The beggest part of boys wanted to play football and be the best football players in the world. It was only a dream of everyone. Nowadays, if you ask any student why he wants to be a football player or a swimmer you will hear that the main reason is the high salaries and popularity. I agree with this statement, because people almost forgot how exciting and fun can be in on sport competitions. 
   The main problem of our time is money. Many people place their bets in special bars and trying to earn money. It used to be a competition too for rich people, but they would only have to prove how good the team or player they bet. However now bets are made by many people(rich or not so) and for them sporting events are already way to earn money rather than entertaining process. 
   Moreover, in the news sometimes stating that the team bought. Namely, that the another team paid the money for the loss or gain but with more appropriate scores for the opposing team because this scores can help the team to reach the semifinals and allow players to earn more money.
   To sum up, I want to say that if you love football or other sport games you should play without thinking about prises. If you are interested in process of playing you will win and after that you will get money which will only be present for your efforts.Money is the reward. If you love what you do you will get what you want. Do not trust your unreal wishes.
