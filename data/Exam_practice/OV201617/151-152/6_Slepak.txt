Nowadays new cooking technology has become intensively develop. If you go to the electronic shop you can see plenty of devices for cooking. But no wonder that while it has a lot of defects, I also think it may have advantages over other technologies.
One of the biggest drawbacks of cooking technology is that some devices have high prices and it is complicated to understand how this equipment work. People who have these cooking instruments have to use them every day and learn how they work. That is why the main question is for what new cooking systems emerge. Some people would argue that these facilities are in popular demand, but others are sure that devices prevent their lives. Eventually, I am sure that cooking technology is not only a new step in universal progress, but also necessary devices in the kitchen. Firstly, people can save much time and spend it with their family or friends. For example, modern coffee machine. You put coffee corns, pour water into this machine and put it on the oven. Secondly, using cooking technology can help people cook delicious meal. For instance, bread oven, pancake machine, multicooker – they are like “must have” nowadays. Nearly all families have some of these facilities. 
Despite of these advantages, I cannot deny that all cooking devices have high prices and complicated instruction for exploitation. Not everybody can allow to buy this expensive equipment. Moreover, I suppose that some devices are insane. For example, “Ham Dogger”. It is machine that makes it easy to form meat into hot dog shape. Of course, it is rather expensive and useless. 
Apparently, new cooking technology is in popular demand. Having said that, I cannot help concurring that there are mainly benefits that facilitate our life.
