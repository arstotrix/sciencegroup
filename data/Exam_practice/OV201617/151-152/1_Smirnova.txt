Nowadays sport industry is becoming more and associated with money. For example we hear about huge wages of coaches and athletes all the time. In my opinion, this fact influences our attitude towards different sport events and, of course, changes the spirit of sporting competition. 


First of all, people often see competitions not as a chance to celebrate talented people and a chance to unite different countries, but a way to demonstrate your wealth. Sometimes we see that government tries to build huge stadiums even though we know that there are better things to spend these money on. Due to that reason, people start talking about it, judge government and ignore the competition itself. This is one of the reasons why the atmosphere on sporting events is not the same anymore. 

Besides, people tend to hate the fact that sports people get a lot of money, even if they are not winning anything. We come up with a lot of gossips, tell each other stupid stories about athletes, forgetting about their achievements, about the point of sport and competition. People are not interested in sport anymore, they started to spend more time worrying about money. 

Due to these reasons we begin to treat competitions differently, we often have something negative to say about competition before theyâ€™ve even started. Unfortunately, it makes great great events worse, and spoils the spirit.
