The chart and table below show us the quantity of the hospital beds and how much different governments spend on the healthcare resources in well-endowed countries of the world. We can see that all countries are aware of the importance of good healthcare.
However, from the chart we can notice that Japan is way ahead from the other countries. The highest amount of the hospital beds per thousand of the population is 14, whereas the lowest number belongs to US and is approximately 4. The second place takes Germany with 8 beds per thousand of the population.
On contrary, the table shows us that the health spending differs from the amount of the hospital beds. Us spends 6,719$ when Japan only spends 2,581$. This is a rather significant difference. Life expectancy, however, does not rely on this numbers. People in Japan life longer than people in US, 83 years against 78. In the middle there are Netherlands because they spend 3,481$ per person, however their life expectancy is 80 years which is 2 years longer than in US.
