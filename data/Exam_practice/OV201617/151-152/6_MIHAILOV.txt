Gaming has become quite an important part of the lives of many people around the world. But while it is considered by many to be a bad influence on growing generations, I also think it may play a significant role in young kids’ upbringing.

One of the biggest drawbacks of gaming is that avid players tend to leave their homes less often than the person not playing computer at all. People who want to achieve actual results in video games, and that is quite a popular goal, indeed have to spend a large number of hours ‘training’, which can affect their health badly. Some people would argue that for this reason gaming should be heavily restricted or even banned.

Another opinion against video games is that people stop socializing whenever they play video games. Eventually, though, this point is easily proven wrong, as a huge amount of young people make friends all around the world specifically via gaming.

Despite what video games’ accusers have to say about health issues, we cannot deny that many popular gaming industries are working towards raising players’ awareness of how dangerous it is to not exercise in between playing. We often get too distracted even with things other than gaming, and like many others, I myself have been a victim to that, which has led to health issues. There are also researchers stating that gaming causes no harm to one’s health, provided one leads an otherwise healthy lifestyle. Finally, it is an undeniable fact that I have acquired quite a lot of knowledge from video games.

Apparently, gaming will continue to gain popularity. Having said that, I cannot help hoping that there are mainly benefits that people give more and more credit to it.
