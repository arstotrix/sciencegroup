The bar chart compares changes in the percentage of foreign alumni in different Canadian universities from 2001 to 2006. 
Tables of 2001 are fluctuating between 3 and 6,5 percent. The biggest amount of students was in New Brunswick, and it stays on the highest place in 2006, 11,8 percent. We can see sharp contrast between numbers of graduates in British Columbia. It has increased more than twice from 4,4 to 10,2 percent.
Two provinces have the same results in both years: Manitoba and Newfoundland &  Labrador. Alberta stands out from other provinces. It is the only place, where percentage of international alumni had fallen back by nearly two percent. Also, this change is the smallest in the group.
Overall, by the end of five-year period numbers have dramatically changed in seven out of eight provinces. Some of areas had successfully doubled the percentage of students.
