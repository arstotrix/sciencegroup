Fast-food has become the most preferable eating in modern world. Fast speed of life doesn’t afford people to relax and have slow lunch. Number of small cafes with hamburgers and french fries is growing up, fast-food is everywhere.  But while it looks so comfortable to have fast snack, I also think it may cause many problems.

One of the biggest drawbacks of fast-food is that it is the reason for dangerous diseases, like diabetes. People who work in office have to betake themselves to this unhealthy food very frequent, and this is what I could call mother of all troubles. A hamburger once a week on Friday is not bad, but fat-laden food every day will affect heart by far. Daily rich in calories meal makes people obese. Some people would argue that such drastic consequences could have junk-food-only diet. However, inactive life compounds matters.

Another disadvantage is that fast-food has very low nutritional value. No important vitamins, carbohydrates, fats, etc. Lack of these irreplaceable elements causes decline and exhausts humans’ organism. Eventually, chemical preservatives can’t change fresh fruits, vegetables and homemade food without health troubles.

Despite all these drawbacks, I cannot deny that fast-food cafes are accessible to everyone. We can eat pizza and burgers on every street corner, and like many others, I visit McDonalds’ after study, which, I hope, won’t fall into a habit. There are also a lot of different menu items, provided the most choosy person to enjoy the meal. Finally, it is unallowable cheep that I like most.

Apparently, fast-food has both advantages and disadvantages. Having said that, I cannot help but mention that there are mainly benefits that justify only economical side of the problem. Health is much more expensive than a hamburger, in that case I recommend to choose nutritious homemade food.
