Overall, both figures have upward trend. They begin with almost zero and go up slowly until 2009, when the graph and the chart start rocketing.

The mutual number of releases grows all the period, since 2009 it soars steeply and reaches the peak - about 80 releases - in 2012. Furthermore, the correlation between cartoons and films always changes: the latter tries growing, in 2011 it occupies even a half of all releases, and in 2012 the proportion have significant changes in live action films' favour.
