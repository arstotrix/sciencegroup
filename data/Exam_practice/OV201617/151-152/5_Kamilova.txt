The diagram shows the changes that took place in a headland. We can see the process of a headland becoming eroded in a coastal area. It follows several steps with affection of nature. In the first stage, we can see the weak areas of abraded rock . In the next stage, the cave is becoming wider which leads to the formation of the arch cave that reminds Durdle Door or Dorset. Of course, the structure of a headline becomes weaker and that is why there is no difficulties for water to beat against the roof stack. The final stage shows the obvious result: a stack begins to separate from the headland, the stumps appear. This process of headline retreating is called the erosion of the rock. This is a natural phenomenon that has nothing to do with the affection of human being. To my mind, it has its negative consequences. For instance, the passing ships may be damaged by the stack which is not visible from afar.
