Many people say that true sportsmanship is on the brink of extinction because of all the money invested into sports.
	I don’t quite agree with such an opinion. As it is with many social tendencies, the best example is always the newest or the youngest. And for sports such is the e-sports (short for electronic sports). Although it started developing almost twenty years ago, it still is rather young in comparison to, say, football or curling. And only recently, since maybe 2009, serious money started being invested into e-sports by large companies which had nothing to do with video games to begin with.
	Until that moment, the players (cybertsportsmen or women) didn’t treat their respectable games very seriously, and there can’t be any sportsmanship in a something that is not sport (or at least isn’t considered as such). For many, if not for all, it was all just a hobby. But as the competitive scene developed a bit, and prize pools of e-sports tournament got larger, players actually noticed that their past hobbies could be turned into something much larger, and that is profession. And what else does sportsmanship stand for, if not professionalism. 
Since that particular moment even more motivation arose for players to get more devoted to the Game. Now, all the best teams have their own training bases with trainers creating special schedules and food rations, so that players can be in their best shape. After every match teams shake hands of their opponents. 
So judging from our example it is evident that money doesn’t spoil true sportsmanship, but encourages it.
