Nowadays most people think that sport is not a game or a way to stay healthy, but the great show based on money. I strongly believe that it is not true.
In my opinion, sporting competitions are always an example of the power of a personal character, on which the notion «sport» is based. Although we can see sportpeople-millioners on TV-sets, the real sport is rarely shown there. For instance, in Belarus athletes earn not more money than workers at the factories or engineers do: these people do sports because of the opportunity to keep control on themselves. Another example of the real sport spirit is Russian Paralympic football team. They have been winning all games for many years, and nobody can come anywhere near them. For me it is the real victory of spirit, where no one can ever think about money. I am sure, these young boys with terrible diseases do not talk about their fees.
However, many people (especially in Russia) are sure that nothing can save sport from corruption. They say that sport system has to be destroyed. I know what became the reason for such thoughts, and Russian football is a very dramatic example of this. Our football team loses all games, however, all players have great fees, it does not matter how many goals they shoot or how many games they win. So sportsmen lose motivation and, of course, all fans stop to support this team. That is why people say that the spirit of sport is wrecked.
Although the world sport history is not lacking in «black spots», I think that the idea of real sport exists in minds if real athletes, fighting for the honor of their countries, not for the fees.
