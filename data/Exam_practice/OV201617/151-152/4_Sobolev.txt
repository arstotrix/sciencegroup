In virtue of huge sums of money in arts sector the question of morality is
raised. There is common idea, that artist is not a real job. Some say, that governments should do something to stabilize this
'unfair' situation.
Indeed, why some people have no money for food at all, and some
artists are earning ridiculous amount of money for work, which is
pragmatically not impactful. If we will compare scientist and artist, thinking
about their non-material products they make, latter
would be in the losing position, cause scientists can at least apply their
ideas to the reality, while art is mental sphere all along. And if we will
correlate artist and engineer, for example, of course second one is more
'impactful' in the protomeaning of this word.
From the other hand, this is how the capitalism works: You are creating aesthetic product, you get money for this - pretty
simple. There is piece of rationality in that statement, however
it is not how the economical system works nowadays. You cannot just give money
to destitutes, and take money from artists. Yes, this is very sad, but the
only system we have. That can be solved easily, nowadays art is accesible to
everyone, starting from films and ending with beautiful buildings. And it can
be related to services sector either, which is the most hope-giving today.
At the end, I want to mention, that government influences on market should be
minimal, because it will disrupt market's balance, which is very unstable.
This problem of survival is on our economic system, government can't do
something about it.
