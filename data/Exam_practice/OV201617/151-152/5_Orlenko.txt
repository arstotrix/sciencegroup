The diagrams demonstrate the stages of the destruction of a coastal area. 
At the start of the process the headland stood much further out. Continuously, the waves attack led to the rock erosion, beating on the weakest areas with some force and forming the cave.
Further on, this process made the cave larger. Over the time it turned into an arch. There is an example of natural arch names Durdle Door, Dorset. 
Meanwhile, the water continued to wipe the structure of an arch. It made the arch instable. At one time the roof crached into the sea and it became a stack.
Eventually, erosion led to the headland reatreating, leaving a stump. The stack standing besides the headland.
Over the time the coastal area dissapeared completely, it was caused by erosion.
