The diagram in the task explains the way in which photosynthesis happens.
The process begins with the stage, when the sun and the air get involved in it. They produce light energy, that is absorbed by chlorophyll, and entering through the open part of the leafâ€™s epidermis (stomata) carbon dioxide, respectively and after they are consumed by the plant .
Initially, this both elements with the assistance of the ground water, which pass through the roots and than through the stem to the rest of the plant, combine in the leaf to produce sugar. Excess sugar eventually becomes a starch for the plant and retains in the roots.
Following this, there is the stage of exit of oxygen and water the same way in which they reach the leaf-through the stomata. The process, when leaves release water, is called transpiration, and during this roots of the plant replace water lost. 
Overall, the leaves, that consumed water and oxygen in the beginning, produce the oxygen, that we breath,  from them in the end.
