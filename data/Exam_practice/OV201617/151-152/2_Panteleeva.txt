The bar chart compares the number of people from all over the world who have got a diploma in Canadian provinces in 2001 and 2006.
Overall, the indicators have significantly increased. In 2001 bars barely approached to the mark of 8 percent, but by 2006 some of them even exceeded 10 %.
A closer look at the graph data reveals that in some provinces the number of international students has grown faster than in others. In British Columbia the amount of university graduates has doubled since 2006. The second and third places where we can see a great leap in the number of international students are Newfoundland & Labrador and Manitoba. There the percentage has increased from about 3 to 7 percent.
Despite the fact that in some regions values have risen faster than in others they are not considered to be the provinces with the highest rates. The largest percentage belongs to New Brunswick where in 2001 the number of students reached 7 % and in 2006 â€“ practically 12 %.
To summarise, the graph presenting the change in the number of university graduates in Canadian provinces has shown that in 2006 indicators increased since 2001 everywhere, however the trends were not alike in different places.
