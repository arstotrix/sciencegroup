The diagram illustrates the changes in rock structure provoked by erosion. Its key stages are presented in four pictures. The first one shows the beginning of this phenomenon:  water impacts on a rock and its weak areas are little by little subjected to the erosion. Because of erosion effect, a cave transforms into an arch. We can see it on the example of Durdle Door in Dorset. Then water still beats, now against arch’s roof, destruction continues and a stack is separated from the retreating headland. The stack is gradually eroded by water and it’s just a stone stump that rests from it. In this way, in the process of erosion water destroys a headland, namely isolates a part of a rock – a stack – and turn it to a pile of stones.
