The graph shows the correlation between the percentages of International graduates from different Canadian universities. It consists of sixteen lines with each pair of them corresponding to a university. It is seen that overall between 2001 and 2006 there has been a significant increase in the amount of international graduates per university. The university of Alberta, on the other hand, is the only example, for which since 2001 the numbers went down by one and a half percent. Out of all other universities there are clearly three leaders, which have more than 10 percent, these are New Brunswick, British Columbia and Nova Scotia. The four remaining have slighter changes. Three of them have held up to the places they were on in 2001, and these are Ontario, Newfoundland & Labrador and Manitoba. The one remaining is the university of Quebec, which has went down form position four to position five on this graph.
