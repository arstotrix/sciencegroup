This diagram gives information about the manufacture of frozen fish pies. There is a construction of a fish pie in the first figure. There is a fish line production line in the second figure. 
In the first picture we can see of what a fish pie consists: peas, fish, sauce, potato. Everybody wants to know how this pie make. We can see two parts of the producing: potatoes and fresh salmon. Let us see the first part – potatoes. Firstly, potatoes are delivered to the factory. Then potatoes go through the cleaning process, peeling, slicing, boiling, chilling, storing and then they get to the second part of producing this pie. Secondly, let us see another part of producing – fresh salmon. It goes through the process of adding lemon juice and salt. Then it is cooked in the oven. After that manual work begin. Workers remove skin and bones. Then inspector prove cooked salmon. This factory doesn’t produce peas and sauce, they add prepared peas and sauce to the container of the system. After that potato and fish connect and are packed. The last step is freezing and storing. 
If we compare these two parts of producing, we can notice differences. First of all, manual work is used only for preparing fish, whereas potatoes don’t require it. Secondly,  potatoes and salmon have different retention period: potatoes can “live” up to one month, but fish – 12 hours or less. 
Overall, after producing fish pie we can see that fish, peas and sauce are in the bottom, but potatoes are on top of the pie.
