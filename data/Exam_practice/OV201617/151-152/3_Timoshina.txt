The graph below shows  the average pass rates among  the undergraduates Year 1 in two years – 2008 and 2012, in several disciplines.
In 2008 the highest average pass rates were among the Computer Science students, at about 70 per cent of students. In the same time, the lowest pass rates arised in Humanities – it was only about 4 per cent in 2008. In 2012 this situation was the same - the Computers Science students were the best in their 1 Year assessment and the Humanity students were the worst.
If we look more closely at the percentage change between two years, we can see that the biggest increase was among those who studied Business. Meanwhile, the pass rates in Health Sciences were stable in both years.
Overall, students in 2012 did their assessment obviously better than students in 2008, so we can see a significant improvement in quality of education in this disciplines.
