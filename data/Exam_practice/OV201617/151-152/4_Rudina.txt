A salary of artists for centuries depends on how their popularity grows. People appraise masterpieces in accordance with canons accepted by authorities in some particular epoch. It is not an exception for our century. Many talented artists have a hard fight to make the two ends meet because the society or a government does not appreciate them and live without any financial support. Is it true?
In my view, any government should take care of art creators. Their income depends on subjective social opinions, which are completely unpredictable. Furthermore, the commercial work of fine art experts is frequently not based on any theoretical methods. Many modern (especially young) artists are lacking not skills but money to present their canvases to the audience and to feature them in exhibitions. Moreover, trends are changing so fast. Those who were on the top earlier, now struggle for survive. Some trends seem to be silly and difficult to understand, but talented creators «must» answer such standards. It is the only way to earn money in this sphere.
However, many people think like this: if canvas or exhibitions of an artist are not popular and the audience do not quite like them, this person has to change his or her way in life. If the artist does not satisfy art needs of the society, what are his or her paintings for?
In some cases it is true, but quite often the situation is controversial. We face to this problem even when we try to define the word «art».


In conclusion,  unemployment in art sphere has become a stern reality for  artists. There are different points of view and ways to solve this problem or to ignore it. Our duty is to support this group of people behalf of our government. That is why leadership should provide workplaces, start-up budget or special payments.
