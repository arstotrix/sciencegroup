The chart and table illustrates information about population in past, present and future in Japan. The chart provides information of 105-year period. 
We can notice the figures, which presented period since 1950 until 2005, rise sharply. In 1960 the number of people was over 84,1 million, whereas in 2005 the number of people was nearly 128 million. They are maximum and minimum values. Surprisingly, the figures decline since 2010 until 2055. If in 2010 the number of people were over 127 million, in 2055 would be nearly 90 million. However, if in 2005 the number of over-65s people were 20 percent, in 2055 would be 41 percent. It will increase in twice. Incidentally, in 1950 only 4,9 percent makes up over 65s people. In 2005 this value is increased and reaches 20 percent. 
To sum up, we can notice that the number of citizen in Japan in future will be less, but the number of elder people will grow up.
