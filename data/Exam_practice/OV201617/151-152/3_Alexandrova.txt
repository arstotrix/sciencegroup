The most significant change was shown in Business. In 2008 only 22% of students passed the exam successfully. However, in 2012 this percentage grew up to 51%.  Interesting changes took place during Health Sciences and Math and Engineering exams. In 2008 almost the same amount of students passed the exams: 18% and 22%.  But in four years the pattern didn’t remind the same. While the Health Sciences’ number stayed at the point of 18%, the Math and Engineering increased up to 60%.
