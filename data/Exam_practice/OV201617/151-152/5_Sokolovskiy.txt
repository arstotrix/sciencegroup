The given diagrams show the process of natural headland erosion. From the first image we can see the root of the problem, the main reason of this erosion. The reason is small caves appearing in the bottom of cliffs. They can be the first sign of erosion. The process goes on and small caves grow into big arches. Cliffs with arches may be dangerous for walking because after this stage the unstable areas above arches crush, separating the headland and the remains of its peak. And the final stage of the erosion is the complete destruction of the separated part. The coastline has become more straight, the land surface has become smaller.
