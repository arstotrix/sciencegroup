The graph shows how pass rates of students have changed from 2008 to 2012 and compares them in different disciplines.
In 2012 the scores in practically all subjects improved and nowhere degradation was detected. Comparing to 2008, 2012 pass rates in Business, Science and Humanities doubled, perhaps, because much attention was drawn specifically to these disciplines. The scores of students who studied Health Sciences didnâ€™t change at all. The pass rates in other disciplines became a bit higher in 2012.
The average pass rates of Computer Science undergraduates were the highest: in 2008 the indicator reached 70 percent and in 2012 it exceeded 80 percent. The lowest pass rates in both years belong to students who studied Humanities, although it is worth noting that in the second year the result of the Humanities assessment improved.
Overall, there are different average pass rates among the presented disciplines and, comparing 2012 to 2008, 2008 students had lower scores than 2012 undergraduates.
