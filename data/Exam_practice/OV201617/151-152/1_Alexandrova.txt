The Olympic Games 2016 have finished a couple of weeks ago. As all big sport events, they were surrounded by conflicts, most of which were based on money. Because of such arguements, many people disrespect sport. They say, that money makes the winners.
Personally, I can’t agree with this opinion. If somebody pays a swimmer, he won’t swim faster. Everything depends on personal abilities, time spent on trainings. Of course, development countries can provide better inventory, fields, trainers, nevertheless motivated and self-confident sportsman can reach the gold without special equipment.
Some sports, like football, are really well-payed. Does the number of fans decline? No. Every competition is a surprise box. There could be great teams with better chances to win, but everyone can show sudden results. An amazing example as football team from Iceland, that has never taken part in World Cup, however become a dangerous rival.
In conclusion, I want to say, that, of course money plays role and not the smallest one. Although, each sport event has fantastic battles and unpredictable ending. That’s why we love sport.
