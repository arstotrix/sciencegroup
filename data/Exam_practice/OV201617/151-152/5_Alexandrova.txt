This picture graph provides information about an appearance of the Hawaiian Islands. 
The chain is located in the Pacific Ocean and has igneous origin.
The oldest volcano is more than 80 million year, so the formation of the chain began at that time.
The very process had started at the 2883 kilometer depth of the Pacific plate under the solid dense rock level, where material magma originates.
Magma is very hot, and once it had reached a "hot spot", the eruption had taken place.
Eruptions had occurred several times on the same place, and as a result was always a volcano.
In this manner had originated the Hawaiian chain.
As it's known, the tectonic plates are moving at a speed 7-9 centimeter pro year. 
Because of that volcanoes changes their location, and as they pass over their "hotspots", they die.
However, the Hawaiian Islands are inhabited, some of the volcanoes are still active and damage human settlements.
