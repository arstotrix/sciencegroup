The graph shows the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007.
There are two curves shown on the graph, blue and pink.
The pink curve shows the number of graduates female, and the blue line shows the number of graduates male.
The graph demonstrates the correlation between the year of University graduation and number of graduates.
We can see that the percentage between the genders is approximately the same on the whole interval time, not to mention a slight preponderance of the female gender since 2006.
In 2001, we can see the trend of significant annual increases in graduates.
This trend led to the highest number of graduates in Canada for the entire period of observation.
The peak number of graduates accounts for 2007 which is almost 150 000 graduates.
Also a small peak was observed in 1995.
