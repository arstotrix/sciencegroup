The given diagram presents a structure, stages, elements and a general location of sea energy stations. 
Overall, such stations are situated near a cliff of a sea wall, about three fourth of their structure on the float or under water and one fourth is on shore. As for the structure itself, such a station consisted of a huge reservoir, where waves are raging, interconnected with a vertical one, formed by two columns. There is a turbine between this columns in the middle of this reservoir.
Rolling of this turbine, caused by active air entrance up from waves and down, causes flowing electricity, schematically denoted as a lightbulb. 
Now we return to two described stages of this process. Waves inflow and raging, intensifying with a chamber in the reservoir, comes up to the vertical one to a turbine and causes its moving in clockwise order. 
Comparing to the process of the wave outflow, when the air goes down from the vertical one back to a sea, a turbine rolls in the same clockwise order. 
This feature causes a constant electrivity entry to some needed contact.
To sum up, there are several stages in this complex process and each one has its own features, omptimized for convienient electricity entry.
