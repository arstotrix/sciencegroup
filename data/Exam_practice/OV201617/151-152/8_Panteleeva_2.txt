The presented diagrams depict the system that is used to generate electricity with wave power.
The structure can be placed on the cliff that is nearby the sea or on the sea wall. There are three main parts that help to convert air into electricity. The facilities that are used for this kind of transformation are a column, where air circulation occurs, a turbine, located in the column, and a chamber, that collects wave power.
As shown in the pictures, first, the wave, entering the area of the chamber, forms air masses that afterwards go into the column. Then the turbine rotates due to the air force. Thanks to the turbine operation, electricity is generated from the air. When the wave departs, the air masses in the column move towards the water, causing the turbine to rotate. These processes ensure that electricity is continuously generated from wave power. So, there is a transformation of wave power into energy.
