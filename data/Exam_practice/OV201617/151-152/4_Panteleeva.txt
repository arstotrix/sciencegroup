Nowadays there are two types of contemporary artists: those, who live a luxurious life thanks to huge fees for their creations, and those, who make ends meet or even suffer from hunger and cold due to empty pockets. Some people consider that governments ought to take responsibility for this situation and make sure justice is done.
I strongly agree with the opinion that providing the poor with money is a duty of authorities. First of all, if governments do not take action and do not solve the problem of artists that struggle to survive, the number of homeless people will increase. There is a high probability to meet homeless artists in public places. In consequence of it nowadays you have to keep track of your belongings as they can be stolen. Secondly, true artists should spend their time and energy on earning. For example, on the Old Arbat in Moscow there are a lot of people who make their living painting with an airbrush. Due to lack of money artists have to engage in routine work instead of creating a work of art. Thirdly, governments should encourage the younger generation to create something for the soul, not for money. Art can disappear as more and more people refuse from the idea to become an artist, because they prefer a highly paid job. More teenagers will want to engage in arts, if artist's salary is stable and in comparison with others well-paid.
In conclusion, it is important to mention what can be done to deal with unfairness. Governments should offer grants that will financially support artists. Another way to solve this situation is to attract sponsors for art. These ways can save art from extinction and I truly believe that governments will take action on this matter.
