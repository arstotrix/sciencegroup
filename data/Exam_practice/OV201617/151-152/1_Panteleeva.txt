Lately a great deal of money has been invested into sport. There is a widespread opinion that this process has a positive impact on the spirit of competitions. I do not really agree with this statement because even though money can help sportsmen or women to progress in their activities, it can also ruin the initial understanding of sport.
On the one hand, those people who believe in a positive effect of money on sport are right. At first, recently organization of competitions has been really improved: thanks to money people use modern equipment. Due to this more and more children are involved in sport. Secondly, the more money will be invested into competitions, the healthier people will be. A person who is not ill is more likely to be engaged in sports than a person who is often sick. As a result of this, sport will develop while a large number of people want to do it.
On the other hand, money prevents people from participating in competitions. Unfortunately, nowadays people have to spend much money to become real athletes. Sport was public earlier, however now some kinds of sport are too expensive and not everyone can afford to engage in them. In consequence, they are becoming less popular. Also, sometimes cases of judicial bribery are reported in news. It is a vivid example of competition discouragement.
In conclusion, I personally think that the spirit of sport mostly suffers from money. Some competitions have turned into the fight «who will pay more?». I sincerely hope that measures will be taken and soon money will only help athletes to achieve excellent results without cheating.
