These two diagrams show how electricity is generated from sea waves. We can see the whole structured process in the pictures. So, this system is established on the cliff or sea wall. One part of a large chamber is directed to the sea, while another part goes to the column, which is directed to the open air. The first picture shows the diagram, on which water comes to the structure and goes to the chamber. Then, the water transforms into the air. This air approaches the column trough the turbine and evaporates to atmosphere, producing electricity. The second picture illustrates the next part of the describing process. So, when water from the sea retreats, the air from the column goes back through the turbine to the chamber. We can see that the turbine spins in one direction in both pictures, no matter in what direction the air goes. All in all, these pictures show us that there are two different phases of producing electricity and they are both very important.
