The given graphs introduce information about process of salmon pie production.
Firstly, salmon pie consist of several ingredients â€“ peas, fish, sauce, potato, - which a held in a container in order to make it easier to prepare pie in a microwave.
Manufacture production of these pies takes several steps. First step is delivery of needed products, which takes up to one month for potatoes comparing with 12 hours or less for salmon. Potatoes then have to be cleaned, peeled and sliced. After that sliced potatoes are boiled. Then boiled potatoes are chilled and stored. The parallel process of salmon preparing is less automatic. First of all, salmon need to be poured with lemon juice and salted and put into a stem oven. Then manufacture workers remove skin and bones from salmon. After that some other workers inspect fish. On the next step all other ingredients (peas, sauce, potatoes) are added to fish. Then being wrapped, containers with pies are frozen. And on the last step frozen pies are stored, ready for being sold.
