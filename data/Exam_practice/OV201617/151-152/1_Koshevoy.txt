Nowadays, there are a lot of people considering sport not only as a sport, but also as politic games, a good way to gain money, and something else.  So, the overall attitude to sport has been changed a lot in the last 20 years. But what has lead to that change? 

Certainly all of us know from news about all of these big dope scandals. For example, the last one with Russian sportsmen and meldonium or the Lance Armstrong scandal, which became a main plot for a lot of books and films. But all this happens because of money, that is involved in sports. When a sportsman wins the medal, all the sponsors and all other people involved in his career gain a lot of money. 

I agree with this statement; I think that now pretty much all the professional sports have lost all of their interesting parts like clear enthusiasm or sporting competition. Now it’s a profession, but years ago it was just a hobby. For example, a lot of famous soviet athletes had a career besides training for the Olympics or other competitions. 

To sum up, I want to say, that nowadays we can easily find different types of non-professional competitions like, for example, the Red Hook Crit – the biggest fixed gear race in the entire world. So, if we want to feel true enthusiasm in athletes, we can watch or even participate in that kind of competition.
