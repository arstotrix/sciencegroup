The chart compares how well students from a range of disciplines did in their Year 1 assessments in 2008 and 2012. From the first look on the chart, we can see that in 2008 students did not do very well comparing to the 2012 year. The only subject where the amount of students passing it was equal, was “Health Sciences”, approximately 42% of students passed this discipline from both years. The lowest score for both years was received from the “Humanities” discipline and in 2008 about 5% of pupils passed it, whereas in 2012 the amount of students who did well with this discipline was close to 15%. The highest scores for both years is received for “Computer Science”, in 2008 the number is exactly 70% of students, whereas in 2012 the number is close to 85%. The biggest difference is in the “Business” discipline: in 2008 only 22% of the students did well with it, however in 2012 the number almost tripled and was 51%. This chart demonstrates that the level of education has grown rapidly.
