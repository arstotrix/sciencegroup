The scheme shows us five stages of headland erosion process from the beginning to the end of this natural phenomena.
Overall, the headland erosion is a particular cause of erosion process. According to the picture, such erosion has its special aspects. It shows how a lump can be separated from the whole headland under the pressure of erosion and how it develops all the time.
To begin with, the first stage illustrates the very beginning, which is the origin og erosion. Some certain points of a massive cliff are being damaged, forming caves inside the headland. The second stage is a destruction of 'the floor' of these caves, so we can see that the erosion process in this case makes its way from the bottom upwards. The third stage can be called a turning point of all process, because this very phase shows a separation a headland and a stack. It must be admitted that waves appear as a accelerator of erosion and help it get along from bottom to top. The fourth stage are the illustration of continuation of erosion:  the edge of a headland is retreating, whereas a stack that has been split off goes on fragmenting and leaving stumps around it.
As is was said above, the main point here is the bottom-up direction of erosion. Changing accelerators in particular causes, we can observes variable schemes. One of them has been just described.
