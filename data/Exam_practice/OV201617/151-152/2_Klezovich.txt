This bar chart depicts a correspondence between the percentage of international alumnus in different Canadian provinces and the year of graduation.
The main trend of this graph is that by 2006 the number of graduating international students sharply increased. For instance, in Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador and Manitoba the percentage even doubled. The only province with the opposite trend was Alberta, where from 2001 to 2006 the percentage nearly fell by one-third. The highest percent of international students in 2006 was about 12% (in New Brunswick). Whereas in 2001 it was only about 7% (also in New Brunswick). In 2001 this percent fluctuated from 3% to 7%. On the contrary, the situation in 2006 was not stable. The percentage of international graduates ranges from 4% to 12%.
Overall, according to the graph, the percentage of international alumnus in Canadian provinces went up steeply between 2001 and 2006.
