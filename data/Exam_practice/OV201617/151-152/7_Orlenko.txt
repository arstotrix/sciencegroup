These two pictures show how the rise and fall of water caused by sea waves causes electricity. The process of electricity generation occurs in two stages using a special installation.
The installation is mounted on the side of a cliff or sea wall. It consists of a large vertical column. Through it air comes in a chamber. Furthermore, there is a space in this chamber which is open to the sea. Moreover, there is a turbine which is inside the column, it controls the waves and generate the electricity. 
The first picture shows that when the water fills the chamber, the air is pushed out through through the column because of the pressure, it is a cause of the electricity generation. 
The second diagram shows the second stage of this process. When the water level decreases and the chamber becomes more free from sea water, air enters the column, which still affects the turbine and generate the electricity.
To sum up, the electricity generates in both stages of the process, which shows how effective this installation is.
