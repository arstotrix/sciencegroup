Fast food has become one of the popular kind of meal in the modern world. But while it is really convenient to eat in fast food restaurants, I also think it may be dangerous for peopleâ€™s health.

One of the biggest drawbacks of fast food is that the fast food consumption can result in 
obesity. People who consume such food very often have to know about consequences such as being fat, heart problems, and this is what can be the predominant factor to deny fast food consumption. Some people would argue that this problem is not so severe because of its exaggerating- all you need is to be able to stop eating too much.

Another point of view is that fast food is tasty. Eventually, it can be supported by many of people that feel a rush of joy in the process of consumption.

Despite the argument against, I cannot deny that fast food brings a lot of pleasure to people. We (all) are slaves of enjoyment, and like many others, I prefer to eat in fast food restaurants, which provide me with maybe unhealthy but tasty and satisfying meal. There are also many happy children, provided with meal that is different from everyday soups. Finally, it is very cheap to consume fast food that, I believe, pleases people most.

Apparently, fast food plays a part in modern rhythm of life. Having said that, I cannot help but accept the advantages and point out that there are mainly benefits that confronts with only one drawback.
