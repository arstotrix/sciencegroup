Industrially produced frozen fish pie consist of the following ingridients: fish itself, potato (these two are the main ingridients), sauce, peas and of course microwaveable container.
These ingridients are delivered to the factory separately and their production cycles are different. Firstly, peas and sauce are not produced at the factory at all - they are delivered from somewhere else and prepared for adding into production cycle. Contrary to sauce and peas, potato and fish are delivered to the factory in fresh stage. Potatoes can be stored much longer than fresh salmon - up to one month, meanwhile fish is to be delivered every 12 hours or less. There are other distinctions in their cycles: for instance in waste disposal. In fish production removing skin and bones is manual, contrary to automatic waste disposal after peeling potatoes. In addition, there is a humam inspection in fish cycle after manual waste disposal.
After wrapping all ingridients into microwaves containers fish pies are freezing. They keep them freezing for all kinds of pies - either for dispatching and storing at the factory.
