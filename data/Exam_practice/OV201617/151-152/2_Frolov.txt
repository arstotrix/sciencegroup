The chart below provides information about  the quantity  of  international  university graduates in various provinces of Canada over a five-year period from 2001 to 2006.
According to the graph, the number of international graduates rised nearly twice  practically in all the provinces except Alberta, where it fell from 5, 5 percent to 4,5.
A closer look to the data reveals that the quantity  of  international graduates rised more in one group provinces than in another one. Thus, in 2006, New Brunswick had the largest group of international graduates, at 11,5 percent of all the graduates. It is 4,5 percent more than it was in 2001. Similarly, in Nova Scotia and British Columbia the percentage of international graduates icreased  from  5-7  to 11 percent over a five-year period. The most significant insrease took place in British Columbia.
The second-largest group is the provices Quebeck, Manitoba Newfoundland and Ontario where the percetage of international graduetes is lower, approximtely 7 percent, but its grouth comaring 2001 is also nearly double.
In summary, the graph demonstrates upward trend nearly in all provinces. Also, it is remarkable that this growth doesnâ€™t depend on the percentage of 2001 year as we can see in Alberta or British Columbia.
