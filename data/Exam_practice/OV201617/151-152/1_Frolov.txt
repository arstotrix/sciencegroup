The main values of sporting competition such as fair play, friendship, mutual respect and peace, healthy body towards healthy mind have their origins in ancient times and constitute the spirit of sport. Since early times there was a conflict between the Olympic idea and its commercialization. Nowadays there are many opposite views on the influence of commercialization on the principles and values of modern sports movement. 
 On the one hand, commercialization can help a sport to survive and develop. Sponsorship may help the organizers of sporting events meet the enormous costs of their organization. Besides, without sponsorship many young athletes would not have the financial ability to devote the amount of time and energy needed to qualify. 
However, the greatest risk is the "sale" of the athletes to commercial companies and the commercial exploitation of their performances. Since the introduction of professionalism and the sponsorships awarded to individual athletes, the number of athletes using doping has multiplied. Individual sponsorships to athletes have introduced unfair competition concequently the concept of fair play has been undermined. 
To sum up, I would like to say that, despite the risks, the spirit of sporting competition has not been  totally destroyed by money.  It has only evolved from its original form, like many other things in the modern world. We should take into consideration the complexity of  organising  the large-scale sporting events and  the training process, the designing and building of the magnificent sporting facilities, the technologies that enable instantaneous world-wide media communication on such a scale. Commercialism and economics are what make international sporting events  and competitions possible.
