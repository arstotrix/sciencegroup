Nowadays a lot of people became interested in sport activity. And among their conversations about sport there is an opinion that with growing interest, with developing of capitalistic relationships in the world we are observing the destruction of the spirit of sport. This question evokes some doubts about and I am going to discuss it in my essay.
Firstly, I must confess that I have never associated the sport with money. Involved in sports activity I believed that sport is for spirit, for something nonmaterial. But with growing I started to understand that most of my ex-competitors, that chose the sport as the way of life, change their desire to take part for desire to win the price. So mostly only children can perceive the sport for spirit and satisfaction.
Another example that confirms the state that sport is a kind of commercial business is the big salaries of modern sportsmen and women. even for person with big moral principles the amount of money that government guaranteed for winning will be a more attractive perspective that pleasure getting from the process.
Also the example of Russian footballers confirms that with money people lose their passion in game when their salaries are large and does not matter if they play well or not. Hence when the sport is a profession, it is all about money, not about competitions spirit.
With growing peopleâ€™s involving in the sport the circumstances for sport activities became more and more expensive and it is mean that only wealthy persons can allow themselves to take part in sports activity and even though in competitions because of starter fee. What kind of spirit of the sport can we tell about in this situation?
All in all, there are enough arguments that show that, unfortunately, the sport now is a way to earn money without any romantics and words about spirit of sporting competitions or activity at all.
