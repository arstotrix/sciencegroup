Some modern artists receive huge sums of money for the things they create, while others struggle to survive. Governments should take steps to resolve this unfair situation. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Nowadays when we think about artists, we think that if an artist is successful and makes a lot of money, it is always unjustified. “Outrageous”, — we may say. However, lets look deeper into this problem and find out, whether the money artists make are rightly earned, or the government needs to sort this thing out?
In my opinion, they deserve to earn the money they receive now for their hard work. Artists, specifically actors and actresses, are workaholics. They spend their entire life on different sets. They work hard, from day to day, and it is no secret, that a good actor or an actress puts his or hers soul into the movie. They often turn their soul inside out in order to fully grasp the diversity of humans emotions. Their job is difficult, but in the end, a good film brings joy to people and brings everyone closer. Artist spent a lot of money and time in order to find and sharpen his or her talent by taking several professional training. They make a lot of effort and deserve to receive the amount of money they do.
On the other hand, there a lot of people who argue that government is wasting money on them. They say that there are a lot of things that are more important in life and has no fundings. For example, there are a lot of homeless people and the government doesn’t move a finger to solve this problem. They close their eyes on the bigger problems and focus on something easier.
All in all, this problem definitely has its pros and cons. Nevertheless, I think that everyone should stop obsessing over how much money movie stars make and focus on something more important. The government should step away from making movies and focus on solving problems that are really important.
