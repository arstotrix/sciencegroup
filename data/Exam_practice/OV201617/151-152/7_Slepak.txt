Nowadays new technologies has become intensively developing. Nearly all people use any devices, which can help them, communicate, find interesting information, read news, and even pay for taxes. No wonder, that these devices absorb many people. That is why, the main question is, is it true that people are forgetting basic skills? Let us see.
Someone are sure that new technologies are poison facilities for living, whereas others do not think so. They suppose that people can do everything because of modern technology. Moreover, I think that the main trend at the present stage of the worldâ€™s development is globalization.  Only because of globalization, people can gain access to the internet and buy modern devices for their needs. Nowadays, any smartphone has a huge number of options. For example, messages, navigation, camera, access to the internet, many programs for using such as 2GIS, YouTube and so on. Even there are many programs for learning in any smartphone. 
However, I cannot deny that these new technologies have bad influence on people. They become idle and forget some basic skills. For example, they can end up in strange places because navigation in their smartphone is not always accurate. Moreover, I am sure that many people forget how use a compass. If they lose their way in the forest and their smartphone runs down, they will not find right way. 
In my opinion, I do not think that because of modern technologies people are forgetting many basic skills. In the contrary, they are getting more and more new skills for living in the modern society. But unfortunately, people become depend on their devices and they are no able to live without them.
To sum up, I would like to stress that new technologies are good things in the modern world and people are not failing to learn some skills.
