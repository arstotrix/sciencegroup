The diagram demonstrate us the process of erosion which happens on a headland leads to its slow disappearance. 
At the first stage a headland stands much further in the sea. The waves constantly attack the foundation of the rock. Due to that it has the weak area, where it starts to erode. 
Eventually the cracks which were created by erosion turn out to be a cave. However erosion doesnâ€™t stop and widen the cave until it becomes an arch. One of the most known example of natural arch is Durdle Door.

As the water continues to attack the arch, the cliff becomes even weaker. This means that it is impossible for arch to support its roof. Clearly, it becomes a stack.

The final stage shows us the result: the stack eroded until a stump appears. It makes the headland retreating but stack standing independently besides the headland.

To sum up, erosion causes slow disappearance of the headland from our planet.
