Every person nowadays heard plenty of stories about how much money modern artists make, selling their paintings, about actors, whose salary for one day sometimes are much bigger than our income for one month. On the other hand, there are some artists, who are not so lucky and popular, who don't make enough money. Of course, people say that this is unfair, that government should somehow fix this situation.    
It may be true, but only to a certain extent. For example, I cannot fully agree with this point of view due to several reasons.                                               
First of all, I don't think that  rich artists got their money for nothing. As we all know, they put a lot of time and effort into their job, and sometimes they don't even have any weekends, they are bound with different types of contracts. Of course, they do it willingly, but they do it all the time so that they could create something that will bring other people joy. These artists are not afraid to express themselves, to put their souls into the work they are doing. Moreover, they weren't born with their salary, they worked hard to get to this point, in the past many actors agreed to every job they were offered just to get some money, to pay for acting classes. That's why I am sure that every artist, who is struggle to survive now will get everything that he or she deserves one day, if he/she will continue to work hard, without any help from the government.     Today in our world there is a huge number of problems that needs to be taken care of. In my opinion, homeless people, the level of pollution are more important than artists' money. If you are convinced that you know a very talented artist, who is underestimated, you always can support him, buy his products, tell your friends about his work. If this artist deserves being popular, people will know about him and he will start getting his money. It seems obvious for me that the government has bigger things to worry about.                              In conclusion, it is essential to add that I am not against government helping young artists, I just think that other organizations should somehow support them, without involving government, which has to focus on different issues.
