It is common knowledge that now a great amount of money is associated with most sports. In recent years the amount of money earned by top sportsmen and women has risen. Stars of most sports such as football, hockey and tennis often feature in lists of the world’s richest people.
Of course, the earnings of sport stars come not only from competitions itself (I mean the prize money available for winning major sporting competitions and trophies). There is a number of sources. Firstly, there are huge salaries for some stars, for instance footballers. Secondly, there are sponsorship deals. Finally, an important source for many stars is advertisement contracts. Of course, all these money are now associated with big sports and to my mind it kills the spirit of sporting competitions.
On the other hand it is true that not all sports stars are very well paid. In addition, professional sportsmen and women have put in years of trainings to be as good as they can at their sport. And their high salaries just stimulate them to be good sportsmen and so stimulate the spirit of competitions.
In conclusion, it is obvious that there are differences between sports and between individuals in the same sports. We should not associate a great amount of money with all the sports and sportsmen. And I think that the spirit of sporting competition is still alive – it manages to unite whole contries during significant competitions, for example.
