Actually, I would rather disagree with that statement. Sports have always been competitive, and it almost hasn’t changed. Modern sportsmen and women have really rough conditions. The compete with the whole world, with great athletes from the past. Today, to become a real professional you have to devote yourself to this deal almost in long clothes, you have to refuse any other kind of living. Of course, there are a lot of easier ways to become rich, so those who want to become wealthy don’t need to step on this curly path.
However, many sportspeople who used to have spirit, change their priorities after getting to the top. They just start working for money, forgetting their past. For example, I can mention some football players from Europe, who have moved to Russia to play in weak teams for big money. Those cannot present their sport. And moreover, if two sportsmen are on one level, but have different priorities, the one who doesn’t think about money will reach much more. Money give weak motivation.
Of course some will disagree. Some are sure, that the only goal for all professionals is an expensive contract. Maybe it is so. Everyone can have a personal oppinion. But I don't believe them. You don't have to break world records to earn a lot, but every year we see more and more impossible records.
