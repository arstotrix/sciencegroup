Well, we can see, that the tendency of increasing the number of international students is true for almost all Canadian universities. The only exception is Alberta university. If in 2001 almost six graduates were from other countries, in 2006 this number fell to about four percent. In other countries the number of international graduates grew. The sharpest increase happened in British Columbia university, where the number  of international students jumped from about four percent to more than ten. The two other universities that had more than ten percent of international graduates are New Brunswick and New Scotia universities in 2006. And New Brunswick had the biggest amount of international graduates: almost twelve percent of all students. So, once again, the whole tendency is increasing of the number of international students and this tendency is quite good.
