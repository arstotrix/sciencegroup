(Graph on p.15)
The data given on the graph show the number of university graduates in Canada from 1992 to 2007. The number of graduates has been risen for 14 years, and reached its maximum in 2007 at about 150000 for female and 95 for male graduates. We can also see that there were always more female students than male.
On the other hand, the gap between the number of male and female graduates fluctuated over the period: for example, it was about 30000 people in 1992 and 55000 in 2007. As we can see thus this gap has widened.
If we take a closer look at the graph, we can see that overall increase in number of graduates was not always stable. From 1992 to 1995 the figure rose moderately, but then there were insignificant decrease in number (from 150000 to 100000 for female and from 80000 to 70000 for male). But years after 2000 saw the strongest increase in number of students.
Generally, we can see that trends for male and female are the same.
