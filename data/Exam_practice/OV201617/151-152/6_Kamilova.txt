Ecotourism has become one of the fastest-growing sectors of the tourism industry. It is a travelling to natural destinations with rare flora and fauna.  People can get unforgettable experience which is rewarding at the same time.  But while it seems obvious for most people that ecotourism has only a positive effect on peopleâ€™s lives, I also think it may have some disadvantages. One of the biggest drawbacks of ecotourism is that some tourists do not understand the negative consequences of their visits to nature. People who travel do not know how to behave and do not follow the main rule of ecotourism, which says that they have to protect the environment, and this is what makes them  pollute drinking water, pick up rare flowers and purchase souvenirs made from skin of endangered species. Some people would argue that this problem can be solved easily.

Another disadvantage of ecotourism is that people might move off the beaten path and scare away animals. Eventually, our environment will be damaged. 

Despite all these facts, I cannot deny that ecotourism is education. We (all) broaden our minds and get new life experience, and like many others, I am sure that ecotourism is a great journey, which you never forget. There are also a lot of opportunities to learn more about local flora and fauna, local people, history, culture and traditions, provided with the fact that this information will help you to get out more of your trip. Finally, it is a great idea to try something new in life; this is the greatest advantage of ecotourism that I like the most.

Apparently, ecotourism has its advantages and disadvantages. Having said that, I cannot help but to believe that there are mainly benefits that will make you try ecotourism.
