Health is the main human wealth. That is why everybody should be aware of it. Of course, the government of any developed country helps people when they get ill by spending money on hospital equipment. According to the chart Japan has more hospital beds per thousand of the population than other countries. The highest number of the beds is 14, while the lowest is 3, in the United States. The second and the third places belong to Germany and Netherlands. We can hardly draw any conclusions, so let's take a look at the table. It shows that Japanese government spends 2,5$ on health, whereas US government spends more (6,7$). So we can say that life expectancy does not directly related to the amount of healthcare resources. It is common knowledge that people in Japan live longer than people in the US for 5 years. Netherlands are between Japan and the United States.
