The given graph shows us how the average pass rates changed for five years. We see that students from almost every discipline improved their results. The biggest improvement took place in business. In 2012 more than 50% of students passed, while in 2008 only about 20% did. In other disciplines the progress wasn't so huge. Computer Science student's rate was 70%  in 2008 and in 2012 it was almost 85%, and that is the highest pass rate on this graph. The only exclusion is Health Sciences. Their pass rate remained about 40%, and didnâ€™t change for five years. But as for the rest, the whole tendency is absolutely positive.
