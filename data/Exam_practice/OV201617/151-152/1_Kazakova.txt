The spirit of sporting competition has been destroyed by the amount of money now associated with most sports. How far do you agree with this statement? 

The spirit of competition is believed to be one of the basics of sports as well as fair play and uncorrupted judgment.  But the sport is too generalized concept. There are professional sports, amateur sports, sports games for children and so on. I think it depends on what “kind” of sport is being discussed. My point on professional sports is that it is much more about big money than the spirit of competition. 

Firstly, people who take part in such sports usually make a huge effort to get where they are. This means that the sport has probably become a very large and important part of their life. For them it is not a game, it is their career, and it should be paid. Secondly, the amount of money may be so large that human greed outweighs the ethical principles. Then the sport becomes a business.

Some people claim that sports people are such great people: they were grown in atmosphere of healthy competition and should appreciate the spirit of sports. Honestly, I’m not sure that the most sports people are such thoughtful to reflect on sports ethics. Probably they are not more thoughtful than ordinary people are.

So, in my opinion big sport revolves around money and not around the spirit of sporting competition. But amateur sports and especially children's sports continue to be a great activity for the body and mind.
