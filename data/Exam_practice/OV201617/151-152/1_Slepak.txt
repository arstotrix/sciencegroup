Most people are sure that sports competition became dishonest whereas others think that money does not play any role in it. But personally for me, the sport competition has been dishonest by reason of money. To begin with, money “captured” the world. It makes people suffer from fighting for a huge sum of money. There is no surprisingly that corruption is everywhere, especially in sport. Moreover, the sporting competitions become more dishonest because plenty of sportsmen and sportswomen are corrupted. That is why everybody can notice that members of developed countries win mostly in all competitions. The most awful thing is that nobody wants to change that situation: to protect the spirit of sporting competition, which was created in VIII century BC.
However, the problem is not in money. Some people are sure that many sportsmen and sportswomen are not able to win (by reason of illness, illegal doping or the worst practice). That is why they prefer to solve this problem in the easiest way as they think. 
To sum up, I would like to say that the spirit of sport has been destroy by huge amount of money. Unfortunately this problem associated with other sports.
