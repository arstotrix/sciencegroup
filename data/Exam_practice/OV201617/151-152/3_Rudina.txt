The figure given in the task shows the differences between the persentage of students passed exams well in Year 1 on several subjects in 2008 and 2012.

Overall, the chart indicates the positive tendention. In 2012 the results became much better, more students did their Year 1 well, only the percentage on Health Science does not show any changes between 2008 and 2012.

To begin with, the lowest amount of high achievers is presented on Humanities. On the contrary, Computer Science students did their 1 Year better than any others. Suprisingly, absolutely opposite subjects with the least and the greatest initial data have the same grows percentage - 10%, saving their positions of “winners” and “lowest”. The most significant leap is noticed in results on Business, where the range of respectable students more than doubled from 23% to 51%. Two subjects have the same increase in 2012, about 20% - I mean Science and Math and Engineering, which are really close to each other.

Summarizing, I can admit that the results are unexpected in some way, but there is easy recognazible logic in them too.
