Today sport has a great influence on our life. We do it every day to keep fit and to be healthy. Professional sportsmen dedicated their lives to sporting competitions of all types. 
 Every sportsman works hard to be a part of any competition. Athletes exercise every day, eat healthy food, control their nutrition, and lead the healthy way of life. To keep them interested, the government pays them. The great amount of money goes to equipment such as uniforms, balls, and so on. One of the most important things to every sportsman is team spirit. Mostly, there is no way to win a competition without it, especially in such sports as football, basketball, volleyball, rugby, and some others.
 However, some people are sure that the spirit of sporting competition has been lost. They think that the great amount of money makes athletes selfish and greedy.
 I partly agree with this statement. Nowadays almost everybody think only about themselves. Money made athletes forget about the spirit of sporting competition at all. All they think about is how they can become rich. Though, there are many exceptions for this theory.  I believe that some people are into sport with all their hearts. I know the examples when sportsmen give their money to charity companies.
 All in all, I think that sportsmen should believe in team spirit, not only in money and financial success.
