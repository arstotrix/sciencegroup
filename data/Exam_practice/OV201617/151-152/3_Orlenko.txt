The graph illustrates the difference between pass rates of first-year students from different departments over five years from 2008 to 2012.

From the first look at the chart, we can see that pass rates in 2012 were higher than pass rates in 2008.

Looking more closely at the chart, we can mark that pass rates in Business and Humanities increased by more than a half, while rates in Health Science stayed the same, approximately 42 percent of students of both years passed the exam. The best scores in both years were in Computer Science 70 percent in 2008 and about 83 in 2012 and the worst in Humanities 4 percent in 2008 and 14 in 2012. What about percentage changes between the two years in Maths and Engineering and Science they appended about 20 percent.

To sum up, students in 2012 showed results better than their counterparts in 2008.
