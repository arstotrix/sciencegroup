The graph illustrates how the percentage of international students in Canadian universities changed for five-year period. The blue bars represent their percentage in each of eight provinces in 2001 and the violet ones – the same thing in 2006. In fact, there is two figures and no dynamic between them.
Overall, the average international graduates’ percentage has noticeably decreased in seven Canadian provinces – in all represented in graph provinces excepting Alberta. There the number of students rose from 4.5 to almost 6 percent and it went up from last place to the fourth for five years (this position has been owned by Ontario with its 3 percent). In other regions, the situation is reverse. Almost all of them have lost about half of international students, but Quebec universities remain with 3 quarters of their students (6 percent instead of 8). New Brunswick still be the first in this chart despite the fact that it has lost 5 percent of its international students (12 % in 2001 and 7% in 2006).
