These two pictures show us how electricity can be generated from sea waves. This kind of method is very environmentally safe. This construction is placed on the cliff or a see wall. The first picture demonstrates the process when the air is going up through the column. The wave is going into the chamber, creating the air. It goes through the rotating turbine, that way producing electricity. 
In the second picture we can see that the air is descending down the column and goes trough the turbine, same as in the first picture. However, in the second picture the wave is no longer in the chamber. Electricity comes form the generator attached to the column, as well as in the first picture. 
All in all, I think that this method can be very efficient and safe, however we need to consider fish and other things that might get into the turbine through the wave. It can damage the whole construction and then the city will be left with no electricity whatsoever.
