The given bar chart introduces information about what were the average pass rates of first year students from different subjects in 2012 comparing to 2008.
In 2008 Computer Science undergraduate students of the first year showed the highest average mark – 70%. The lowest results that year had first year students from Humanities – less than 10%.
As it is seen from the graph, the highest grade and the lowest grade in 2012 was shown by the students from respectively the same disciplines as in 2008. However, the percentage of success in assessments increased. The highest pass rate in 2012 was over 80% and the lowest rate was around 15%.
Overall, the main trend of this graph is that average pass rates in 2012 significantly outnumbered average pass rates in 2008. Nevertheless, there is one exception to this trend: Health Studies first year students’ average grade remained the same at a level of approximately 42%.
