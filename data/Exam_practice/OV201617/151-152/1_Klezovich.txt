Nowadays plenty of people suppose that sports have lost an atmosphere of challenge, because money has an influence on them. At the same time others strongly believe that a will to win and to overcome yourself will always keep sports being gripping and awe-inspiring. So which of these opinions seems wiser and more sensible?
First of all, some people do not think highly of professional sportplayers, because some of sportsmen and women take part in competitions only because of money they earn for it regardless of winning or losing in the contest. Those sportsplayers are inclined to procrastinate and they even become lazy, because they do not have incentives to win. Moreover, spectators and sportsmen and women can not acquire a taste of competition, because, unfortunately, sometimes referees are payed bribes to give a victory to one of the players or teams. Therefore this predictability ruins whole game.
On the other hand, according to another opinion, nothing can destroy emotional aspect of taking up some sport. Indeed, pushing oneself to the limits to win make this person feel on top the world and even more alive. That is why there is still a lot of consummate professional sport players, which inspire other people to take up sports. Furthermore, sometimes people, who are involved in a contest, take bribes. And when it comes to unfair competitions, we should not turn a blind eye to this problem and punish referees and sportsplayers, who take bribes. This will return competition its atmosphere.
To my mind, money in sports is a very complicated problem and there is more to it than meets the eye. So we should exclude financial causes of negative influence on sports. If we weed out bribes in sports and keep awakening interest in sports among the people, sports will become challenging, tense and suspenseful again.
