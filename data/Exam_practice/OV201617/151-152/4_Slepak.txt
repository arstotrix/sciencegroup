Nowadays art become very popular in the modern society. That is why artist is rather respectable profession. It is no wonder that modern artists can receive much money, whereas other people are trying to earn their living. Somebody are sure that the government should solve this problem, but others do not think so.
To my mind, the government should take steps to resolve this problem. First of all, this situation is really unfair because people are sure that to be an artist is not a job. They think that it is a kind of entertainment. Secondly, if people have higher education, it will not mean that they will have a high-paid job at all then artists. By the way, modern artists may have no any education at all, but they can get higher salary then well-educated person. 
However, some people cannot agree with this point of view. They are sure that modern artists have a real talent which can be paid very well. Moreover, artists can express their feelings and the audience can easily understand and support the work and even buy it at auctions. Another point is that modern artists are able to develop culture, that is why they have such huge salary.
To sum up, I have a strong point of view that government must resolve this situation, if they want to have harmonic and stable society.
