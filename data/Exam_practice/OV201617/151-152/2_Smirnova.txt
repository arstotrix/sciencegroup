The graph provides information about the percentage in the number of international students graduating from universities in different parts of Canada between 2001 and 2006.
The only province where the percentage of these students decreased was Alberta. In 2006 approximately 4 percent of its students were international compared to almost 6 percent in 2001. In 2006 Alberta became a province with the smallest share of international students, when in 2001 we could say this about the province of Ontario. In 2006 though its numbers rose to 6 percent.
The most dramatic increase in the share in international students, on the other hand, was in British Columbia. The figures rose from 4 percent to almost 11.
The province with the highest percentage in 2006 remained the same as in 2001 - New Brunswick. Its figures rose from 7 to 12 percent.
