The system described on two given pictures shows the way of generating electricity from sea waves. The system is pretty simple and there is a minimum of details in it. They are a chamber with an narrow enter and much space with air inside, and a column where air can easily go up and down. The turbine generating all the electricity is situated inside that column. The whole construction is very logical, incoming waves push the air, saved inside the chamber. The only way for the air to go out is the column and while leaving it turns the turbine. After that, when th chamber is filled with water, it starts going back and pulls the air back inside the chamber. It enters again through the column and turns the turbine backwards. This that turbine turns back and forth and produces constant energy without any harm to the nature. So, this construction may be not the most effective, but it is surely one of the most simple and safe systems of producing energy.
