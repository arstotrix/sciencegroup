The problem of relations between art and money has always been discussed. Some people think that nowadays governments could resolve this situation. As for me, I am sure that it could but should not. 
First of all, I absolutely agree that there is an injustice. It’s true, many talented artists die in poverty and we often see overrated people who receive enormous money for their products. One the one hand, each person would like to have a job he or she can well gain at. Furthermore, actually it is not a big problem to earn money just to survive. However, this scheme works differently due to artists, it is inevitable. There is a perception that true art is priceless. In my opinion, this is a fate of artist because real artist has to inure to the benefit of humanity and to truth.
I do not really think that governments can pay to artists for their works: in this case it transforms in some market where an artist become a wageworker and fills an order of the power. Art is creating not for a fee and can’t be paid. That’s why this point does not concerns only authority but also any source of money for artists. The one way to help artists I accept is creating some platform and worthy conditions for them (like rights protection or free education).
