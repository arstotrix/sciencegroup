Sport is an integral part of human being’s life. Because of the money, that are invested in sport nowadays, the number of scandals grows daily. Does it mean, that the spirit of sporting competition has been destroyed? 
To begin, some sports are associated with money because the equipment for trainings is very expensive. Sportsmen need money to train in good gyms with professional team of doctors and trainers by side. It means that money do not disturb sportsmen’ attention, but help them. Furthermore, every sportsmen knows the rules, which he or she is obliged to follow to be respectable in sports society. Being respectable means not earning much money, but getting high scores in games or winning competitions. Sportsmen have a rush to compete with each other and money never could destroy it. 
Nevertheless, being a sportsman means to have a high-payed job. Because of it, sometimes a motivation to win a competition vanishes. For example, Russian football players have a big salary and it does not matter for them whether they lose a game or not, because they will get the money anyway. That is why sometimes the spirit of sporting competitions dies. In addition, it is not a secret that by the 21st century many institutions are commercialized. And sport is not an exception. People want to win at any cost. As a result, there are a lot of scandal news about sportsmen, who take drugs. 
In conclusion, sport itself has never been about the money. But, as time passes, there are more and more exceptions by the 21st century.
