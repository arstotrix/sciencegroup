The graph below illustrates the difference between students' results of their Year1 in 2008 and 2012.                                         The best average pass rates got computer science students, 70% in 2008 and 80% in 2012. Students who study humanities, on the other hand, had the lowest pass rates in both years.         The most dramatic change was in the results of Business students. They improved their rates from 20% to 50%. Students of math and science showed almost the same change in their passes.                                                            
Students of Health sciences got exactly the same pass rates in 2012 as in 2008, which are 40%.                                                  Overall, in 2012 students got higher pass rates than in 2008
