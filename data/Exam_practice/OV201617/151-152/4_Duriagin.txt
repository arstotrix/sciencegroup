It is true that some artists are paid very well for the things they create, whereas the other part of people creating pieces of art find it quite difficult to sell their talent. Then the question is: Should the governments take measures to equal somehow the difference between these two groups?
On the one hand, there are artists who have reached a certain level of wealth selling their paintngs. At the same time, there are those whose talent wasn’t spotted and they have to survive by doing jobs they don’t like, so that these artists won’t end up their ‘career’ on the streets. This situation without any doubts is unfair. However, we must remember that rich masters haven’t always been rich and famous. Almost everyone started from having nothing but a pencil and a piece of paper in their hands. And, as the time went by, only those who developed their skills in painting the best, reached a certain level of talent became well-known and could make a living from selling their masterpieces. In my opinion, the sphere of art is a place, where if you are giving all your strength and will to your works, one day you will be spotted and admired by the society. So, those, who struggle to survive either don’t do enough to receive good money for their art works or don’t have talent in art and their heart is not into it truly.
For me, it seems obvious that the governments have much bigger problems to solve. And they shouldn’t relay to this question about inequality of the artists in any way. For such problems there are many cultural organisations.
In conclusion I would like to say that the government should focus on questions and problems that are much more important than the difference between money artists get from their art works.
