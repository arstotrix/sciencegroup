Some artists are paid huge sums of money for their works. There are pieces of art that were sold for more than 100 million dollars, for example “When will you marry?” by Paul Gauguin.  For this reason has right on existence an opinion about necessity government intervention in the art marketplace.
I find this idea very reasonable. For me modern art is inexplicable, strange and mostly ridiculous. On exhibitions artists present what they call art: stones, rubbish, fuzzy photos, inartistic paintings. All of these objects can be made by a child. Due to their absurdity, prices for such works can’t be as high as they are. Many artists put a lot of effort into their works, but through it don’t get any response and financial support.
On the other side we have art objects, which were made by great artists, whose contribution to the arts was enormous. We can’t deny the value of their works, either of which is like a pearl. However, today we have not less talented artists, who work hard and make beautiful paintings and sculptures. Their arts depreciate on the background of older ones, and this is not fair. It can kill motivation for creating in case of lacking of money. 
In conclusion, I want to say, that none of art objects costs these amounts of money people are ready to pay. Government control is important for equaling chances of creative potential realization of each artist: young or old, great or unknown.
