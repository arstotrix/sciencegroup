The bar chart shows the difference between students’ results in the Year 1 in 2008 and 2012. As can be seen on the graph, for the most part of the disciplines the pass rates have risen in 2012. The only course, that didn’t have any changes in percentage of people, who successfully passed it, is Health Sciences.  The lowest pass rates in both years had students, who study Humanities. On the contrary, the highest percentage of successful completion was in the Computer Science test. The most significant rise of pass rates was in Business, which were about 20% in 2008 and 30% in 2012. In other disciplines the progress wasn’t so huge. For example, Maths and Science average test results had almost the same change, comparing years 2008 and 2012. Overall, in 2012 students showed better results than in 2008.
