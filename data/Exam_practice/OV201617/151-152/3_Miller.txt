The chart shows the changes in first year undergraduates’ rates in 2012 comparing to 2008. Each bar represents one of six disciplines. 
Overall, average pass rates increased or did not changed at all. Thus, rates in Health Sciences stayed the same – approximately 42 per cent. Meanwhile, in the other five courses students improved their grades. Pass rates in Business, Science and Math and Engineering appended 20-25 %, Humanity rates tripled but stayed the lowest – 12% in 2012. Computer Science students showed the best results in both years: 70% in 2008 and 83% in 2012.
To summarize, we can see a positive trend in students’ rates but there are noticeable differences between several disciplines.
