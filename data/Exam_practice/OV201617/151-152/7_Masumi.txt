There are two diagrams in the task that describe how process of getting  electricity from sea waves occurs.
 
The first diagram relates to the stage when wave reach cliff or sea wall, while the second one shows the last milestone of process when wave leaves it. 

The construction consists of chamber and column which are responsive for the right direction of air, got from the outside of construction during the stage of decreasing wave. In the column there is the turbine that spins in the same direction during both stages of the process, provided with air. This spinning is resulted in electric current,  switching on the lamp in the diagram.
The last stage in the second diagram is marked by decreasing wave. This wave is followed by air that comes into the chamber through the column from the outside. After that air fills the chamber until next wave comes. With every new wave process repeats and does not let the lamp be turned off
