It is common knowledge that contemporary art (such as painting, photography, sculpture, may be, architecture, etc.) is an important part of everyday life of big cities. Some artists’ works are very well-paid meanwhile the others are not well-known, and their authors are not famous artists. Of course, governments can take certain measures to establish fairness, but to my mind, it is not a good idea.
Of course, many people can argue, that we now live in time of humanism, tolerance and fairness. Many governments and private services, departments and agencies care of homeless people and animals, old men, unemployed, etc. Our society is trying to give equal chances to all living creatures. And why shouldn’t we do it to infamous, poor artists? In addition, many fascinating, talented works (we can even say – masterpieces) can stay unknown because of lack of support.
On the other hand, we already have some organizations that provide support for poor artists. In my city it is, for instance, Moscow Artists Union. They take care about artists that face struggle for surviving. We also should not forget that state white collar workers may be not arts critics, it is short-sighted to allow them to decide what artist should be rewarded for his works – they can choose really bad works. Thirdly, many people argue that gifted artists just cannot stay infamous – if they are genius, they will find their way and their glory anyway.
To sum up, I would like to emphasize that government should take measures, but they should support organizations like artist unions, not artists themselves. It can help gifted artists to become more popular and rich and make this entire situation fairer.
