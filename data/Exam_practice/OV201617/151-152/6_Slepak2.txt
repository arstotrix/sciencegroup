New cooking technology has become more popular nowadays. It can lighten our life in the modern world. But while it has a lot of disadvantages, I also think it may help us find more positive parts.
One of the biggest drawbacks of new cooking technologies is that some devices have high prices and complicated instruction for using them. People who have some of these cooking instruments have to use them every day and find out how they work. The main question is for what new cooking systems emerge. Some people would argue that these facilities are so senseless that they would never use it in real life, but others are sure that these instruments are in popular demand and they would get them. Eventually, I suppose that new cooking technologies is not only a new step in the universal progress, but also necessary devices in everyone’s kitchen. Firstly, people can save much time and spend it with their family or friends. For example, modern coffee machine. You need only put coffee seeds, pout water into this machine and turn on. Consequently, I save nearly 10 minutes. Secondly, using cooking technology can help people cooking delicious meal. For instance, bread oven, pancake machine, multicooker – they are like “must have” nowadays.
Despite of these advantages, I cannot deny that new cooking technologies have high prices and complicated instruction for exploitation. We, of course, do not want to spend too much money for these facilities. Not everybody can allow buying this expensive equipment. Moreover, I suppose that some devices are insane. For example, “Ham Dogger”. This machine makes it easy to form meat into hot dog shape. That is why it is rather expansive and useless.
Apparently, new cooking technologies have become intensively develop. Having said that, I cannot help saying about complicated instruction for using devices that there are mainly benefits that these instruments produce.
