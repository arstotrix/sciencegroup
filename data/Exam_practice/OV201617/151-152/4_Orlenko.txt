It is well known fact that some artists earn more money than other. It has been suggested by some that governments should be involved in solving of this situation. From my point of view, they should not control this. First of all, I would like to consider that this is normal when people have different salaries for the same profession. Imagine if you work harder than anything else or your skill level higher than that of your colleagues and at the same time each of you gets the same salaries it would be unfair. Moreover, it can due to strikes or irresponsible executions of the works of some employees of companies and it is only a small part of the problem. Furthermore, if all artists will have similar salaries there will be no concept of talented artist. For example, there is a person who has a big talent and who can earn a lot of money by selling their amazing creations, but in the world where their efforts are not assessed on merit he can not fulfilled himself until there is a remuneration system. It will cause that talented artists will cease to create because they will think that nobody likes their works truly. To sum up, I want to say that if you want to earn more money you need to learn better at the university and to take up the work that you really like and do what you do best. After that your income will increase. Governments should not worry about sloths or illiterates incomes, it is a personal challenge for each of us.
