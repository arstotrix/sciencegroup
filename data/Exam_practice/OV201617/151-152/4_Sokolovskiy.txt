In my opinion this is absolutely ridiculous. Should governments resolve unfairness? In 1917 we tried to resolve the unfair situation and that brought new poverty, executions and unhappiness, killed culture and intelligence. Everyone suffered, at least everything was fair. So, to answer the question itself, governments should not do anything with this. Artists have power and ability to earn a lot, and they do this. Many of them take part in various charities but it is their own will. Of course, governments should help poor people, especially those, who are in real troubles like young mothers with no husband, or disabled with no close relatives, but why should we say that it is unfair, when some people earn more than others?! It is fair.
