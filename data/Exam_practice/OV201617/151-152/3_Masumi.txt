The bar chart in the task shows the changing patterns of studentsâ€™ assessments from a range of disciplines from 2008 to 2012. In brief, students became more successful in 5 out of 6 disciplines in this two years. 
In detail, the most well assessed students were in computer science, where this assessment increased from 70% to 80%. The same tendency of rising can be seen in other four disciplines with exception of health sciences, where the proportion stayed the same in both 2008 and 2012. Regardless of the same trend, every discipline had their own variations, for example, the assessments in business and humanities increased more than a half, while the change in math and science was less significant. When it came to the lowest position, it belonged to humanities, where the highest point was in 2012 and this point is a little bit more than 10 per cent.
To conclude, there is a progress in an assessment of a range of disciplines among the students.
