The diagrams below illustrate the process of generating electricity from sea waves with the help of a special structure. 
The main part of this structure is situated on the cliff or sea wall. It looks like a vertical column with an open top. Inside of it there is a turbine which is used to generate electricity. The second part of the structure is called chamber and it is connected to the column. 
The first diagram shows the first phase of generating electricity which starts when the wave approaches to the cliff. When the water hits the chamber, the air in the column is forced to go up into the atmosphere through the turbine, thereby generating power. 
The second diagram illustrates what is happening after that, when the wave starts to go back from the cliff and escapes that chamber. Due to that the air is sucked back into the column again through the turbine, which is why the electricity continues to be generated. 
In conclusion, we can see that after the second phase the wave goes back to the chamber and the first phase of generating electricity is repeated, which is why this process doesn't stop.
