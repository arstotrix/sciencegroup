There are many opinions on should the state spend money to support poor or jobless citizens or not. One side of this problem is the question: should the government decide how much money is fair to pay for different art works? If one artsit is paid much worse than other one, do we have right to judge if it is fair? I think that the state shouldn't make any financial support to those artists who are 'unfairly' poor.
Firstly, I'm sure that there is always a possibility to make a good career in sphere which one is talented in. Trying really hard is usually rewarded. 
Secondly, it is unfair and demotivating to those artists who are about a success and as well demotivating for all artists. Where is any reason to work hard, if the government will help you only in case of your fail?
So, my opinion is art is a complicated area, so the state shouldn't interfer in its economy at all.
