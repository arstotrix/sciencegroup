Reality shows that everyday more and more money are invested in sports , which, as a result, badly influence spirit of sport competitions. This issue can be argued considering all the positive effects money investments have on sport industry. 

Unfortunately , over the past years sport fans had to see a lot of cases where big money decided whether one could take part in a competition or not and sometimes even determined the winner regardless of the capabilities of the participants, which surely affected people's trust and made a lot of true fans disappointed. 

On the other hand, as long as huge corporations like Nike and Adidas sponsor competitions and governments keep supporting sport in general, spectators have the possibility to enjoy well organized games in different parts of the world where the best of the best are brought to compete with each other. Such atmosphere and all the preparations for the upcoming events raise enthusiasm and bring people's attention to sport. 

In addition, provided that sport competitions are a big deal to a huge number of people, prizes for the winners should be up to the mark. Winners of the Olympics get cars and all kinds of social and financial support in their countries. In other words, when goals are set high, people are willing to achieve more and set new records, which lead to a growth of attention to sports. 

In brief, even though nowadays a huge amount of money is invested in sports and sometimes it changes the rules of the game not in the best way possible, overall, it has a positive effect on sport industry and sporting competitions specifically.
