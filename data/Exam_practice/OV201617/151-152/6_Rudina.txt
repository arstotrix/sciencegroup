Genetically modified food has become incredibly popular and spread all over the world. But while it is criticized by multitudes, I also think it may solve many world problems.

One of the biggest drawbacks of GMF is that it is caused by directed mutations, which lead to unpredictable genetic organism behavior. In other words, it cannot be harmless. People who try to prove that often make methodological mistakes, and this is what does not allow us to assess GMF, healthy is it or not. Some people would argue that GMO mutations do not differ from all other ones, taking place in our organisms, but experts deny this point of view.
Another disadvantage of GMO is that modified organisms break the natural process of new species and species diversity creating. Eventually, GMO endangers many essential things of our life as biological species.

Despite many evident disadvantages, I cannot deny that GMO is useful in some cases. All people know about increases in prices of natural vegetables and fruits. They have increased because of expensive using of fields, ground is limited and costly resource nowadays. We all save much money because of GMO, and like many others, I am not against GMO, which is often restricted by governments. There are also enough scientific papers proving harmless of GMO, provided that accurate denials of them have not been created yet. Finally, another one advantage is a possibility to give food to people under condition of overpopulation and sources limits that I suppose must be taken into account most.

Apparently, GMO is a controversial theme nowadays and have many evident drawbacks as many other innovations of XX century. Having said that, I cannot help claiming that there are mainly benefits that help us live better with GMO, but many health scientific papers, discrediting harmless of GMO, must be examined.
