The bar chart gives information about preferences for living place among students in a 4-year period from the 1960s to the 2000s.
Overall, we can see that over the period, there were a markable increase in percentage of students who shared house or flat with other ones and a slight decrease in the percentage of those who stayed at home. As for the other two variants, the ratio of those who preferred to live in a host family or in students hall or residence was approximately the same over the period.
Looking at the detail, the percentage of students who share a house or a flat started at 35 per cent in the 1960s and reached the highest point of 70 per cent in the 2000s and became twice as high as it was at the start. It steadily increased by 5 per cent every decade, except the 1980s, when it rose dramatically by 20 per cent. Otherwise, the percentage of students lived in a host family slowly declined from 35 per cent at the 1960s, when this type of the accommodation was as preferred as living in a shared house, to 5 per cent at the 2000s, so this one became the least popular. As for the ratio of those who lived with their own family, it fell from 15 per cent in the 1960s to 5 per cent in the 1980s, stayed at the same level in the 1990s and after this point, in the 2000s, became more popular again and rise by 7 per cent. Finally, the ratio of students who lived in the hall or residence, which began at 15 per cent in the 1960s, was fluctuating all over the period, nearly by 5 per cent every decade, and in the 2000s reached the point of 12 per cent.
