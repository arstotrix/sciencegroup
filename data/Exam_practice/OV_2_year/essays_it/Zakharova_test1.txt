Two graphs are given: the first is the line graph providing us information of the global amount of 3D screens from 2005 to 2011, the second one tells us about the year amount of animation and live action films released in 3D.
At the first glance we can observe permanent growth of both number of screens and the quantity of 3D films as time goes by. The most intensive increase is seen from 2008 to 2010 in the global amount of digital 3D screens, it rises from less than 10,000 to 40,000 in this period. From 2008 to 2012 the number of animation and live action films released each year also grows dramatically. In the year 2008 it was less than 10 films and by 2012 it reaches the level of more than 70.
As for the two types of released films, it must be noticed that at first animation 3D films dominates the live action films, but over time the gap between them reduces, and since 2011 the situation becomes exactly the opposite.
