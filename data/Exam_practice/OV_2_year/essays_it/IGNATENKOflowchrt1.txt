The flowchart given in the task describes the process of consumer goods manufacturing and how information is sent back to earlier stages so that adjustments could be undertaken. First thing we can observe is that the diagram presents two cycles: one shows manufacturing process flow and the other illustrates information feedback flow. Going back to the first one, this cycle begins with collecting raw materials and manufacturing components and conveyance them to the storage. After that follows product planning, which connects product research and design stages to the manufacturing process. Next stages, dedicated to the products manufacturing itself, involve assembly, inspections, testing and, finally, packaging. When the product is ready, eventually, it should be dispatched and sold. Independently from the process described above market research and advertising are done. The information feedback, as it is shown by the other cycle, is available on the following stages: product planning, testing, sales and market research. Looking on the flowchart we can conclude that goods manufacturing is rather flexible process and can be thoroughly controlled due to availability of many possibilities to feed back information on earlier stages.
