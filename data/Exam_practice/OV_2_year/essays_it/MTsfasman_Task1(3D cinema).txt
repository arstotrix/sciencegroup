The graph and chart given in the task show information about 3D cinema realeases and global digital 3D screens from 2005 to 2011.

The graph gives information about changes in the number of 3D screen produced.  It had been increasing slowly from 2005 to 2008 (from 0 in 2005 to about 2000 in 2008). Then there was a sudden drop and for the next 3 years the number had grown from about 3000 to nearly 40000 screens. 
The chart shows how the number of live action and animated film realeases had changed. It was 2 animated 3D films a year from 2005 to 2008 and then started to grow.  Only in 2008 first live action films were released. The grow of the global 3D cinema releases number had begun in 2009. From 2009 to 2012 the number  of animated films realeases had grown from 2 to 25. On the other hand, the number of 3D live action cinema releases had grown from 2 to 50.

This is what I have been able to observe.
