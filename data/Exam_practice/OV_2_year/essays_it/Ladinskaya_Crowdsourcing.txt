   At the last lesson, we have watched the video by Erin McKean’s, who is a lexicographer. She talked about making new words and explained that everybody can do it. You only have to send new word to her and she adds it to the dictionary. 
   I would like to think about this idea and decide which are good and bad sides. 
    Of course, it is very interesting adding new words to the dictionary. Our vocabulary will be enriched with new words and we can be proud of doing something for language. ‘’Go ahead, make up new words’’, said Erin. But I think that many of these words will be not useful for people. These are the words that already existed, but now joined together and became a kind of new word form. For example blend words (Oxbridge (Ox(ford) + (Cam)bridge). Some people are even annoyed by the reduction of words. 
    I don’t like when new words taken from the English appear in the Russian language and are converted to the Russian style. For example the word “рэндомно’’. I don’t know why but it is annoys me. In my opinion, we as the Russian speakers have to save originality of the Russian language. Our language is very rich and diverse. However, we understand that the world develops and everyday people make new technology. And it is easy to borrow words from another language, usually, from English, because it is international language. Also, we can express the whole Russian phrases in one English word. For example, Russian ‘’поход за покупками’’, we can replace with the English word ‘’shopping’’. Then, we can form cognate words as ‘’шопиться’’. It is very interesting! 
   To sum up, I want to say that Erin’s idea is bold and interesting
