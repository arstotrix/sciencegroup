The information about 3D cinema screens and 3D cinema releases, given in the graph and chart, shows the changes between 2005 and 2012. It is obvious that the graph and the chart are related:  at the beginning of the period, the number of digital screens and cinema releases was low, but after 2008 it suddenly started to rise. 
The changes that happened in number of cinema releases between 2005 and 2006 are barely noticeable. In 2006-2008 the level remains the same, but in 2008 besides animation a new film category appear â€“ live action films. After that, the number of cinema releases increases significantly and keeps rising constantly during the next four years, with another spontaneous bound in 2011. 
The increase of 3D cinema releases depends on the increase of the number of 3D digital screens.
