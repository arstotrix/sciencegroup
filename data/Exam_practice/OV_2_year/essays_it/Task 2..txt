Task 2
The education in different countries of the world is differently structured. There are countries such as Great Britain, America, where students are free to choose the subjects they want to study. Also there are countries where the government generates the educational program. What is better is a great question.
I am from Moldova. In our country we are not allowed to choose the subjects we want to study. While learning at school, we have had lessons from 8 to 14.30. It was really difficult for us, but at the same time very interesting. We have grown up world-round developed. I think that such educational system builds character.
 Changing of activity from mental to physical is the key to success. It is commonly known that every person is unique. Non-academic subjects take a lot of free time and it may seem that they are like sticks in the wheels. However, exactly on the lesson of physical education, cooking and so on, where all students are divided into teams, students get tougher and become closer to each other. The aspect of teambuilding is very important for classmates.
Those students, who are born with clear-thinking brain, never have difficulties with maths, chemistry, physics and they usually help those students who are better in sport.
To sum up, I consider that human beings can be very different in their abilities and while trying different directions, they can find themselves. In the school is given general development mental and physical. Thus all the subjects (academic and non-academic) are very important.
