The given columnar diagram provides us information about the types of student accommodation in the ages 60, 70, 80, 90 and 2000. Four types of accommodation are presented: room in a house or flat shared with other students, host family, hall of residence and one's own family.
Looking through all the bars of a chart we can observe that the room sharing type of accommodation was the most popular between students of all the presented decades.  But it has to be mentioned that in the 60s the percentages of students who were sharing a flat or house and of those who preferred living in a host family are equal. And the numbers of students who have chosen a hall of residence and who stayed in their own home are also equal in the 60s.  The second place is occupied by the host family in the 70s and the 80s and by the student hall of residence in the ages of 90 and 00. The least popular type of settlement is the own home in the 70s, 80s and 90s and the host family in the 2000s.
In addition I can say that we can observe the permanent growth of the number of students sharing a flat or a house and the permanent decreasing of the percentage of those who live as a paying guest in a host family. The number of students preferring the hall residence is nearly the same during all the periods.
