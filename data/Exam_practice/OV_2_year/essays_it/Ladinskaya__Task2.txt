Task 2 
     Nowadays, education has a big place in our life. Children have academic and non-academic subjects at school. Some people think that it is good for their children, whereas some others believe that, we should only learn academic subjects. I believe that, we should have a combination with these two kinds of subjects. In my essay, I will try to show you advantages of these two types of subjects. 
      There are good sides of non-academic subjects such as physical education, music and cookery. These areas (in my opinion) help children communicate with each other. It is very interesting to cook with tour classmates or participate in competition with them. Students can not only develop their personality and skills but also enjoy with each other. 
     Academic subjects also have many strong influences on many areas as architecture, medicine and others. Everybody knows that subjects like literature, mathematics geography will help students to understand what they want to do in future life. These subjects are useful for students, help them to involve in modern society. However, we know that children canâ€™t sit on one place and lose their attention and concentration, when they stay a long time on one place. 
     In conclusion, non-academic and academic subject should be in schools together. We can combine them to give children more chances for their personal development.
