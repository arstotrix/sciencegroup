The flow chart illustrates different stages in the production of consumer goods manufacturing. It is noticeable from the chart that the goods manufacturing is a complex process from collection of raw materials to the end product. This process may seem very simple from the first view. However, it involves many complicated stages.
Firstly, raw materials and manufactured components are kept in the store room. Secondly, they are transferred to production planning stage. After planning stage the production planning also needs the stage of design.  While the design is directly related to product research department and only after all these steps the finished products are assembled to inspection and testing department. 
However, if something goes wrong in the packing design, the production is returned back to design stage for re-designing. 
The fully tested products are packed and ready for dispatch to sales section. Finally, sales stage, on which depends the planning and design of the goods.
To sum up, in manufacturing process every stage is very important, so every wrong step can have a negative impact on sales.
