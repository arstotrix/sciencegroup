Without any doubt, human language is in process of continuous development. Every year a huge amount of new words appears, but many of them aren't represented in the dictionary and therefore people regard them as wrong and incorrect and neglect them. So we are led to the question: should we use crowdsourcing method while compiling and expanding dictionaries or it would be better to charge the professional lexicographers with this job?
On the one hand, crowd-sourcing allows to track the appearing of the new words immediately and fully, because many people from all over the world can participate in this process. Thus the whole amount of words in the language would be represented in the dictionary, the superstitions about words considered wrong would disappear. 
On the other hand, the employment of the professionals guarantees correctness and accuracy. Moreover it helps to preserve the language norm threatening to be destroyed if anyone coul change the contents of the dictionaries freely.
That is why in my opinion, crowdsourcing is an excellent way to expand existing dictionaries and compile new ones but it still should be done under control of the experts.
