The given diagram shows the steps of consumer products manufacturing process, as is clearly shown in the diagram that goods manufacturing is a complex process from collection of raw materials to the end product.
Firstly, raw materials and other components are stored together and production planning is done. There are two types of manufacturing process: one is manufacturing process itself and another one is the information feedback process. After the product research, the design part is done and this input is used in product planning stage. After the production planning goes complete the assembly, inspection, testing and packaging stages are done sequentially. Feedback from testing step is used in design stage and which led back to product planning stage. Again, the market research affects the design and advertising stages and inputs from the market research stage is used in packaging stage. The final two stages are dispatch and sales. The information flow stages gives feedback to other stages to refine and adjust the process.
Thus, the consumer goods manufacturing process involves both the multi-staged manufacturing and research methods. The manufacturing stages involve the storage, assembly, inspection, packing to the sales methods whereas the research stages include market and product research, design and advertisement.
