The graph shows the percentage of American and the UK driversâ€™ income spent on petrol depending on their social class.
As can be seen from the graph, there are different trends for UK and American drivers.  Interestingly, the general tendency for the UK is that the richer a driver is the more they spend on petrol, while the trend shown for American drivers is exactly opposite. In the UK the rate of income spent on petrol gradually raises from nearly 0.5% for the poorest to 3.5% for the richest, while in the US it slowly decreases from 4% to 2.5%. Interestingly, while the rates for the poorest American drivers are nearly 8 times as high as those for the UK drivers with the lowest income, the percentage for the richest drivers is about 3% in both countries.
