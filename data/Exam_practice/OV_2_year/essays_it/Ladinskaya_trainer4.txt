The graph compares the percentage of income which spent by 3 types of people 

in USA and UK. It is divided into 3 sections: the poorest, middle-income and the 

richest.

    The first fact which can be seen from the graph is that the biggest difference is 

between the least wealthy people. American poor people spend around 5% of their 

income, English low-class people spend only from 0.5% to 2.5%. However, as far 

as people earn more money in America their percentage of spending on petrol 

continues to drop, it is opposite in the United Kingdom where the percentage 

increases.

In conclusion, this graph demonstrates that rich people spend an average of 3% of 

their income in petrol, both in America and in UK, although the main difference 

between these two populations it is the amount spent by the lowest class of their 

people, USA citizens spend more than 3 times than UK inhabitants.
