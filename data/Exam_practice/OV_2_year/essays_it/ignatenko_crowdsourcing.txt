In one of Erin McKean’s ted talks the problem of the lack of dictionaries renewability is raised.
She is a lexicographer and her point is that we should study all words, even those which are considered to be colloquial, slang, in a sum, not to neglect the words, excluded from classical dictionaries. But there are people, who can disagree with such opinion. Their point is that we should endeavor to keep language purity and not to pollute our speech.
So, Erin McKean’s position is based on the idea that language is presenting an immense and beautiful system, which keeps widening, and it can’t be squeezed into a small paper book. Therefore, she proposes a solution for this problem: crowdsourced dictionaries, which can be freely edited by anyone. Thus, we could collect much more material than we can have from ordinary dictionaries, and we would have not just lonely words, but words in context they occur, which helps to get their meaning more precisely. And such dictionaries could help to cover all the vastness and diversity of the language we describe much better than classical dictionaries do.
Those who are against crowdsourced recourses can substantiate their position by telling that if everyone will affect the language norm in the end we will lost the norm and this can even lead to misunderstanding among people. So, they think about some new and slang words as about «bad» and inappropriate for any kind of dictionaries.
To my view, new, colloquial words are very interesting and worthy to study. Of course, that doesn’t mean, that we should disregard the norms and standards of language, but we can’t not to pay attention to such words,because otherwise, we can miss many interesting facts about how does the language work.
