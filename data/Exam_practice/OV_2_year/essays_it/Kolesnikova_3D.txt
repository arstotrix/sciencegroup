The given graph and chart provide the information about 3D cinema screens and film releases. The diagram shows the number of the 3D movies that are showed in cinemas from 2005 to 2012. The line graph demonstrates the three- dimensional screens which had used in cinemas from 2005 to 2011.
There were not any 3D screens were released in cinemas in 2005 and earlier. From the end of 2005 to 2008, the number of 3D screens that were being used in cinemas had begun to increase slowly from about 2000 screens in 2006 to 3,000 screens at the end of 2008. Then, there was a sharp rise in the amount of screens released until it reached to 38,000 3D screens in 2011. 
We can see a significant increase in the 3D screens which had released in cinemas in period from 2008 to 2011. The number of movies in the period between 2008 and 2011 had a sudden rise as well.
Over the three years from 2005 to 2007, the number of 3D animated films that had showed in cinemas was steady about 2 movies. In 2008, 3D live action films started to be released in cinemas. From 2008 to 2012, the number of 3D live action movies that had showed in cinemas went up sharply, it located around 40 movies of 3D cinemasâ€™ movies in 2012.
Thus, we see that using of 3D technologies is increasing every year more and more.
