Task 1
The given chart shows the amount of illiteracy rates by region and by gender in 15 years. 
The most illiterate people are from undeveloped countries such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Arab States and South Asia (15-55%).While the number of men in the same countries is lower (28-34%).
Actually, in developed countries the percentage of uneducated people is from 1% men to 2 % women. It means that almost every person both men and women want to be literate.
In Latin America and East Asia the percentage doesn’t exceed 20 for men, and doesn’t exceed 10 for men.
It means that only in Third World countries is going to be a lot of illiterate people, especially women by 2020, while developed and developing countries have a tendency to be literate.
