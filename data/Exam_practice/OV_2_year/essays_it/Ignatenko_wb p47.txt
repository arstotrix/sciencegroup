The two diagrams given in the task provide some statistical information about wildfire population changes: the pie chart shows the ratio of reasons which caused population changes over the period from 2000 to the present; the bar chart illustrates percentage change in population figures observed over the same period.
As the pie chart shows, the most crucial reason for population changes is a habitat destruction -- it makes 43% of the figure. Beside habitat destruction we can see such causes as pollution, overexploitation, random factors, disease and an introduction of exotic species with percentages as follows -- 21%, 15%, 12%, 6%, 3%. The bar chart marks different families with different bar fills and each bar describes one species. So, we can observe, that changes are mostly negative, but there are a few positive growth in species population: most of mammals populations have increased in number -- quantity of bats and foxes increased by 23% and 9% correspondingly and also the quantity of aquatic animal which are not water voles increased by 9%. For all others we can see a diminution in percentages, and the most noticeable is among insects -- the ratio of butterfly and bees decreased by 42% and 43%. At the whole the situation looks quite unstable and some species even may become endangered in the near future if nothing will be changed.
