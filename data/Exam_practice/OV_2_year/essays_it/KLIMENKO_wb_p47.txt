The two given charts show information about wildlife made by a group of scientist in a particular area from 2000 to the present. 

The pie chart gives the causes of changes in wildlife population. The main reason is destruction of habitat (43%). Next one is pollution which is nearly half lower than the first one (21%). Then comes overexploitation (15%)  and after it - various factors like accidents which are 12% of reasons. The last ones are twice and four time smaller: 6% for disease and 4% for introduction of exotic species.

The bar chart shows number of which animals has become higher or lower in numbers as well as in percent. 11 species have declined and only  3 have increased. All species  are combined into groups: freshwater fish, birds, reptiles, insects, mammals and aquatic mammals. Insects are the most damaged group, because it has become smaller nearly by half  (42% for butterflies and 43% for bees). Fishes are less endangered (29% for trouts and 26% for salmons). Birds, reptiles and part of mammals and aquatic mammals all are decreased less than by 10%: 8% for skylarks, 6% for owls, 5% for sparrows, 8% for grass snakes, 6% for sand lizards, 8% for hedgehogs and, finally, 3% for water voles. The 3 species which population has grown are bats (23%), foxes (9%) and otters (9%)
