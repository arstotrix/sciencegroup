The diagram given in the task illustrates the correlation of personâ€™s gender and a region where he or she lives with their literacy, expected in the 2020 year.
	So, one of the dimensions that we can see on the chart is gender. From region to region we can notice a tendency for women to less literate, than men are. The most crucial difference between male and female illiteracy rate is observed among inhabitants of East Asia/Oceania region: the percentage of illiterate women exceeds more than twice the percentage of illiterate men. In regions like Latin America/Caribbean and in developed countries the difference between a percent of literate men and women is rather insignificant: they are almost equal.
	The second dimension, obviously, is a region. The highest literacy rate is expected for inhabitants of developed countries, for men and women both. The biggest illiteracy percentage is predicted for men and women, living in South Asia.
	To conclude, it is estimated the most literate would be men who live in developed countries, and most illiterate would be women from South Asia.
