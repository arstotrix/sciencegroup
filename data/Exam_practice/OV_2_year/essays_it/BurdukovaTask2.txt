 In today's fast-moving world many people maintain that to succeed academically young population do not require non-academic subjects at their schools, therefore physical education and cookery should be deleted from the syllabus. Other people, and I am among them, disagree with this idea.
To begin with, I would like to say that it is extremely important, especially for children, to have a rest during the studies, because concentration on academic subjects demands a lot of efforts, time and patience. Many people can not go on working on another task without a relaxation. In many cases changing the activity can help young people to relax and continue working with refreshed mind, which is necessary if they want to succeed in academic work. Moreover, presence of non-academic subjects  such as physical education in the schedule at school is good for the young people’s health and can help children to be sporty and keep their body in good condition. Also cookery can be really helpful and useful in children’s future life no matter where they will live or which career they will choose.
Nevertheless, my opponents think that having non-academic subjects at school is just wasting time and all common knowledge of cooking and sport today’s young population of the world can find on the Internet or watching TV or from their parents and friends.
My opponents can not convince me that non-academic subjects are useless. Not every person can have an ability for such research, therefore these important for life things should be taught at schools. 
To sum up, it is up to each person to decide whether non-academic subjects are required at schools or not, but I am definitely sure that learning non-academic subjects  has more benefits that drawbacks.
