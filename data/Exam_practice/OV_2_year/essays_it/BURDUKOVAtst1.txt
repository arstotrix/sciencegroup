The given graph and chart illustrate changes in 3D cinema screens and film releases during the period between 2005 and 2012.
The most obvious trend in the chart is that the figure for live action movies, which appeared only in 2008, increased markedly compare to the figure for animation moviesfrom just  approximately 2 in 2008 to over 50 in 2012.  On the other hand, the number of animation films , which were the only films that existed  with just 2 film a year during the period from 2005 to 2007, increased steadily year to year, from 9 in 2009 to 25 in 2012. The growth of live action movies was faster because of the striking growth of number of global digital 3D screens. This impresive growth we can see in the graph , the number of global digital 3D screens rised throughout the whole period, peaking at over 35,000 screns in 2011.
