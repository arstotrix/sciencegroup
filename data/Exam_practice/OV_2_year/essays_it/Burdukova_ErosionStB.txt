The diagram illustrates the process of a headland slowly becoming eroded in a coastal area.
In the first stage, the weak area appears at the bottom of the headland. Continuously, the waves attack the base of the cliff in its weakest area. In the next step, the rock eroded into cracks which grew bigger with time. The cracks created by erosion expand into the natural arch cave, for instance, Durdle Door or Dorset. Next, the structure of the headland becomes weaker and weaker, so that it is very easy for water to beat against the roof. Further, roof goes into the sea when a mass of rock grows higher than the mainland so it eventually becomes a stack. What is more, the rock erosion continues to be witnessed in the powerless area until it finally leaves behind a stump. As a result, it forces the headland to retreat while the stack remains standing independently besides the headland.
Overview, headland gradually disappears from the surface and this process follows several natural steps without any interference from human beings.
