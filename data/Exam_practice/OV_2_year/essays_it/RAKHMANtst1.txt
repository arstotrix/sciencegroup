 In the given chart we can see the number of digital 3D screens, existing in the world, for each year from 2005 to 2011 and the number of released 3D movies for each year from 2005 to 2012.
The chart also shows, how many of live action and animation movies are released in 3D in each year.
First thing that can be mentioned is that the more 3D cinema are being released, the more digital 3D screens exist. 
For example, in 2005 there were no digital 3D screens and only one or two movies have been released.
In 2011 the number of 3D movies was about 50 and the number of digital 3D screens was slightly higher than 35 000. 
The amount rising speed is also important. For example, before 2008 both figures were rising rather slowly (in 2008 there were about 3 or 4 3D cinema releases and about 3000 3D screens). 
But since 2009 both figures were rising rather fast.
