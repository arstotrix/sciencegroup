The statement says, that someone thinks about non-academic subjects as distracting from academic subjects, which are considered more important, so they(subjects like cooking and physical education) should be removed from the syllabus. 
	For those who succeeded academically there are many advantages in removing non-academic subjects from the syllabus. First, they would have more time to spend on their interests and they may get better results in studying academic disciplines. Besides that, their average grade   can increase in case if, for example, their physical form is not good enough.
	But, from the other point of view, there is a lot of a use in non-academic disciplines. For example, there are people who don’t have an interest in academic disciplines, but are doing very well in sports— so, for such students physical education is an important part of syllabus. For those, whose priority is studying academic subjects it is also useful to acquire such basic skills as cooking or to develop their physical form.
	In my view, all students need non-academic subjects at least a few hours a week and such disciplines should not be removed  from the syllabus.
