The graph below shows us the percentage change in places where students lived in their education period from 1960s to 2000s. 
As we can see renting room in a shared house or flat with other students was more popular than other types of student accommodation during the period between 1960s and 2000s.  However, students rented room or a flat and students paid guest with a host family had the same percentage (35%) in 1960s. Later the popularity of living with a host family began to decline with each decade. In 2000s, the difference between renting room in a shared house or flat with other students and living with a host family as paying guest was huge (70% and 5% respectively). The percentage of students who lived in hall of residence varied from 20% to about 13% during all five decades. Students lived at home with own family had the lowest percentage in 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, but in 1960s and 2000s living at home was as popular as living in hall of residence.
Thus, it can be concluded that students do not want to live alone or in family. They would like to expand their circle of acquaintances, have new friends and be more independent. That is why young people want to live with other students.
