On the given chart we can see the prediction of the level of illiterate men and women in different regions of the word made for the year 2020.
It can be divided to three parts: developed countries in which the level of illiteracy is lower than 10% of population, Latin America and East Asia in which this level is higher but still rather low and Sub-Saharian Africa, Arab States and South Asia where the level of illiteracy is exetrimely high.
In all countries the level of women’s illiteracy is higher than men’s. Interesting that even East Asia isn’t the most illiterate region, the difference between men’s and women’s education is the biggest, the level of women’s illiteracy is twice as high as men’s.
