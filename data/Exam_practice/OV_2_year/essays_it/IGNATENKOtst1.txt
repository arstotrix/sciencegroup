The given illustrations provide information about how changed the amount of 3D screens throughout the period from 2005 to 2011 and for 3D film releases from 2005 to 2012. On the graph which illustrates changes on the market of screens we can see, that in the initial point the quantity is close to a zero. Then, it starts rising slightly till the year 2008(from less than 3000), since when begins a noticeable growth. The number of released digital 3D screens continue increasing till 2011(where it gets about 40000), but in the end we can see that the growth decelerates. Going on to observing the second chart, which is about global 3D cinema releases we can see a strong correlation between an amount of screens released and an amount of films. As it was in the previous graph, in the beginning the number of cinema releases is slightly higher than a zero. The most significant growth falls within the period from 2008 to 2012 and it gets its maximum, which is more than 70 films per a year in the end. We can also see how many animation film were released in comparing with live action. So, till 2008 exclusively there was only animation. In the 2008 about a half from all cinema releases were live action cinema. The percentage of live action continue increasing till the end and in the last year more than 40 action films are released, while animations are only 25. That is all we can say about the two illustrations.
