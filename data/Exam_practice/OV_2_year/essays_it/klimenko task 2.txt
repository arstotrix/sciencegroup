Nowadays, there is a belief that non-academic school’s subjects aren’t really useful and the syllabus should be rewritten so there will be extra place for academic subjects. But is academic success so important as society makes it.
One the one hand, these non-academic subjects are extremely important for children. First of all, school always used to be taken as a stage of educational process at which children are supposed to broaden their knowledge as much as possible. Only in that case they could choose their future activity according to their own experience. I think, that such a jobs as a sport trainer or a chef in restaurant aren’t less important than a scientist, maybe in some ways they are even more, because they are related to our everyday life.
On the other hand, there are people who think that the time devoted to teaching non-academic subjects could be used for teaching other ones better, because there is a huge gap between what is given in school and what is asked at university. Moreover, non-academic subjects are not only a waste of time but also a distraction from what children really need and there is no way to concentrate on, for example, math after a big marathon during PE.
In my opinion, the real problem is included in the over-grown prestige of academic success and higher education as it is. It causes lack of workers  in other kinds of activity and, for example, in Italy there is no one who wants to continue to work on family farms to produce wine or tomatoes, because every single young woman or man has at least a bachelor degree.
In conclusion, I want to say that it is really important to stop non-academical workers’ and staff’s shaming because all the jobs are important to society’s well-being. And for those who are worried about their children not having academic success there are a lot of examples of successful people who even didn’t finish school.
