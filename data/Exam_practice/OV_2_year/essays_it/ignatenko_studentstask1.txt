Now I’m going to observe the given chart, which provides an information about where students resided over five decades from 1960 to 2000. According to the graph, in 1960s students were likely to live in the room, sharing house of flat with other students or to be a paying guest with a host family (35% for both rates). Percentages for those, who accommodated in students halls of residents  or at home with their own families are quite lower, but also equal as previous two — 15% each. In 70s rates of residents of students halls and shared flats have increased by 20% and 40% respectively. The rate of students, living in shared flat or house kept growing till 2000, where it got its maximum — 70%, and that is the highest percentage presented on the chart. Percentage of those, who lived as paying guest, on the contrary, decreased with every decade and by 2000 reached its minimum (about 5%). Oscillations of other rates over the whole period were rather slight. Rate of students living at home started declining, but it didn’t get lower than 5% and latterly almost returned to its initial point(about 15%). Percentage of halls residents ranged from 12% to 20% and finally set at the level slightly below 15%.
To sum up, we can say that by the end of observed period the most common type of students accommodation became living in a shared room or flat and the less popular — living with a host family.
