At the given chart it is shown the level of male and female illiteracy in different regions for the 2020 year.  First thing that can be mentioned is that the percent of female illiteracy is always higher than a percent of a male one in the same country. Sometimes this difference is not very big, but sometimes the gap is really huge. For example, in the developed countries both figures are less than 5%, in Latin America they both are about 10%, but in East Asia and Oceania the level of female illiteracy is more than two times higher than a male one (in that region women illiteracy rate is 20% an men one is less then 10%).
In such regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, Arab States and South Asia both figures are much higher. For men, it is about 30% in Africa, a bit less than 40% in Arab States and 35% in South Asia. Female figures are about 48, 52 and 55 percent.
