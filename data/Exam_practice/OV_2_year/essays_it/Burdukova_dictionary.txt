Nowadays some people are convinced that dictionaries should be made by  professional lexicographers while others, and I am among them, feel that crowd-sourced dictionaries are really advantageous.
There are a few reasons why I am in favour of making crowdsourced dictionaries. To begin with, making dictionaries with the help of the general public saves time, it, actually, speeds up the process of compiling dictionaries. Thousands of people can participate in this process simultaneously to deliver results faster than lexicographer could ever achieve in-house. What is more, the crowdsourcing organization uses knowledge, user experience or creativity of the online volunteers. Therefore, opening up to crowdsourcing and public input is an excellent way to identify new talent. A task can attract many very skillful individuals that were unknown.
Nevertheless, some people may argue that unknown resources are not good in making dictionaries because they are not professionals and examples of questionable quality of their work can easily surface in crowd-sourced dictionary and spoil it. 
Personally, I do not find this statement convincing enough.  Everybody can find and make as many words as possible. Languages have no age or experience limit. Thus, people should help lexicographers in compiling dictionaries. Lexicographers can achieve significantly better results even with the little help of community. 
All in all, it is up to each person to decide whether crowd-sourced dictionaries are beneficial or not, but I am sure that its positives definitely outweigh its negatives.
