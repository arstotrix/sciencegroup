 The graph below shows the percentage change in places where
students lived over five decades. We can see types of student
accommodation from 1960s to 2000s.
 At first sight at this graph we can see that the most popular type of
student accommodation is a room in a shared house or flat with other
student. It is the first type of student accommodation in our graph. The
graph shows that this type became more popular over the years, from
1960s when it took 36% to 2000s when it took 70% after 40 years. Also,
we can see that second type of student accommodation which is a
paying guests with a host family lost position over the years, from
1960s when it was 36% (like first type) to 2000s when it was only 3%.
Two other types of student accommodation which are students hall of
residence and living with own family have about the same percentage
over the years.
 According to the graph we can make conclusion that today students
