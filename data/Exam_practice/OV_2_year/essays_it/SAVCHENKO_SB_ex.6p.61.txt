The diagram illustrates the four stages of erosion of headland.
In the first stage, we can notice that the rock in its weak areas initiated to be attacked by the waves, so the rock appears a crack.
In the second stage, this crack becomes larger and larger over the time. By the way, the connection area with the rock is less and less. Thus, the cave starts to look like an arch. There is an impressive example of natural arch in Dorset, which is named Durdle Door.
In the third stage, the water hits the roof (connection), so the arch becomes instable. At some point the arch breaks off and goes into free-swimming.
In the fourth stage, the stock eroded until it leaves behind a stump.
To sum up, the headland falls apart due to erosion. Erosion is caused by the waves, which are beating the rock and erasing it. The areas of rock become eroded, without any affection of human being.
