First of all, raw materials and manufactured components are stored together, then the production planning is done. At the same time production reserch is realized and then the design of the products is developed. After the production planning goods are assembled and inspected. During the next manufacturind stage all goods are tested. On that stage market research and advertising are also carried out. Afterwards manufactured goods are packed and dispatched to the saling premises.
