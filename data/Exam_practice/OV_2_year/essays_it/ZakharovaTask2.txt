Academic achievments have become the main factor of young people's success nowadays.as the youth becomes more and more ambitious and the schedule becomes more and more busy many people are ledto the question if non-academic sbjects are needed at school.
Some peope think that non-academic subjects such as P.E., cookery, photography and others are completely useless and should be eliminated because children need their whole learning time and concentration to improve their results, do their best and be succesful in future. And non-academic subjects are regarded as a barrier on their way to academic success.
Personally I completely disagree with that people, because non-academic subjects teach children qulities that must be very important in every person's life such as leadership, strengths and responsibility. Moreover young people can develop special skills that are useful in their independent everyday life (cooking, sewing etc). It is also worth saying that not every person wants to succeed academically, there is a lot of other areas which could be interesting and appreciated by young people. Some of them can't live without art, others want to succeed in sports, the third may dream about their own business.
That is why it is very important to give all the children the opportunity to develop their skills and talents, to do what their want to do. In addition Ican say that non-academic subjects are also important even for those who have chosen an academic career. For example, P.E. is a very good way to fight stress, to become more healthy, motivated and concentrated. 
To put all in a nutshell, I would like to say taht even those who want to succeed academically can't go without non-academic subjects at school.
