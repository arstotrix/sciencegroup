Nowadays students in schools are facing a grate lack of time. Many of them don’t have any free time at all. Sometimes, such a heavy pressure makes students unable to concentrate on some subject better. Thus, one of the ways to solve this problem, which is being very widely discussed nowadays, is to remove some subjects from the syllabus, for example to remove physical education or cookery. 
My opinion is that this way is not an excellent solution, but it is rather acceptable. Of course, physical education (or any kind of sport) is a very useful for child at least as it helps him to be healthier. May be, it is even more useful for a child subject like chemistry. Chemistry will never help to the journalist, or to the linguist, or to the businessman, but sport will. But the great difference between chemistry and sport is the fact that you can do sport without anybody’s help, but you can’t learn any scientific subject without a teacher. The same about cookery: you can easy find many different recipes on the internet if you really need it.
So, I think that to remove non-academic subjects from the syllabus is a rather good idea. This will give to students an opportunity to not waste their time at school on what they don’t really need.
