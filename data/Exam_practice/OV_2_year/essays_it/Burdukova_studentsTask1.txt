The given chart illustrates changes in the percentage of students who lived in different places during the period between 1960s and 2000s.
The most obvious trend in the graph is that the number of students who shared a house or a flat with other students increased steadily decade on decade, from 35% in 1960s to 70% in 2000s. On the other hand, the proportion of students who paid guest with a host family fell markedly, from 35% in 1960s to 5% in 2000s. Furthermore, living with family was the most unclaimed accomodation option among students, from 1960s to 1990s. However, in 2000s the percentage of students who paid guest with a host family went down and became the least in the table. Meanwhile, the figure for students who lived in dormitory fluctuated over the time period, with 15% in 1960s, peaking at 20% in 1970s and 1990s and decreasing to 15% in 1980s and to just over 10% in 2000s.
Overall, room in a shared house or flat with other students was the most popular type of accomodation among students over the whole period. This shows that the majority of students don't want to be alone, they prefer to live with their peers.
