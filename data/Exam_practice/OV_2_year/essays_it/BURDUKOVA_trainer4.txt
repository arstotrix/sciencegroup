The presented line graph shows the comparison of spendings on petrol in relation to salary for people in the United States and the United Kingdom.
As it is observed, the most striking trend is that the American citizens with the lowest income spend much more money on fuel than the English. While the Americans spend from about 4% to more than 5% of their income on fuel, their English counterpartsâ€™ spending lies within 0.5% to 2.8% of their income.
Moreover, it can be seen that there is an inversion in trend for the rich.  The percentage of spending on petrol in America starts to fall, as Americans get more money, while in the United Kingdom the percentage progressively increases.
In addition, the expenses are only equal for middle-income groups in both countries. 
To sum up, the percentage of income spent on petrol generally goes up in the United Kingdom, whereas in the United States it is declining.
