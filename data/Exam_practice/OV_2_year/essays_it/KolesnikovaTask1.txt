In this picture, we can see the diagram that shows us estimated world literacy rates by region and by gender for the year 2020.
Firstly, it can be noted that the percentage of illiteracy among women is much higher than among men. The highest illiteracy rates among women are in such regions as Sub-Saharan Africa, Arab States and South Asia. The figures are almost identical. In other three regions, the percentage of female illiteracy is much lower. Women of the developed countries are the most illiterate while women of South Asia are the most literate.
If we consider the percentage of illiteracy among the male population, we will see that it differs from womenâ€™s literacy. The highest illiteracy rates among men are in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. In Arab States the percentage of male illiteracy is the highest too but not so high as in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Men in Developed Countries, Latin America/Caribbean and East Asia/Oceania have the lowest percentage as women.
Thus, we can conclude that women of that regions are much illiterate than men. Also it may be noted that illiteracy rates in Developed Countries, Latin America/Caribbean and East Asia/Oceania.
