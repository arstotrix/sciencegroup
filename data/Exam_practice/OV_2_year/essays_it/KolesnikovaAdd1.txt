Every year the state of our planet is deteriorating. Polluted waters, the atmosphere and the soil, cut

down forests, destroyed the animals. Lakes and rivers are most in need of care, because it is one of the 

most important sources of life for all living things on the Earth.

The pollution of lakes, rivers, seas and oceans of the huge emissions of enterprises leads to the death of 

a huge number of sea creatures. Dying out entire species of fish that serve as a means of survival other 

animals and some people. Some marine animals mutate and become a threat to the other inhabitants of 

the rivers and lakes. 

It is also necessary for humanity to take care of rivers and lakes, because it is a huge supply of fresh 

water. People can not drink salt water of the seas and oceans, so they use fresh water from rivers, lakes 

and groundwater. In many countries (of Africa, for example), there are very few water bodies, so the 

purity of rivers and lakes is very important for them, otherwise people will die. 

Pure water has a great importance in human life, animal life, plant world, and nature in general. I agree 

with the statement that people need to think about the natural features such as rivers, lakes, seas, 

oceans, forests etc. All of them are the natural resources, which are vital to all living creatures on our 

planet. The humanity need to take care of the bodies of water, build more sewage treatment plants and 

to minimize waste emissions from the enterprises. If people are more concerned about the planet, life 

on earth will not become worse.
