The line graph given below demonstrates fuel costs compared to salaries of people from UK and United States. The income is divided into 3 groups: poor, middle-income, rich. Due to this division the difference in UK and United States is very visible.
It is noticeable that in the United States poor people spend the biggest amount of their income (more than 5%), although the percentage decreases at people with middle-income ( from 5% to 4%), and rich people (from 4% to 2.5%). The line increases from poor to rich.
In UK the line totally differs. The most spend on fuel rich people (about 4%), people with middle income spend (from 2.5% to 4%), and people with poor income spend (from 0.5 % to 2.5%). The line decreases from poor to rich.
To sum up, the graph shows an inversion between UK and United States.
