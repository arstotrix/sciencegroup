The supplied charts represent data on wildlife population from 2000 to the present. The first chart illustrates reasons for wildlife population changes in a particular area, and the second chart describes how animals of that area have been affected.
Obviously, the predominant reason for the population changes is habitat destruction,while the impact of diseases and introduction of exotic species were less significant . Moreover, 21% of wildlife population changes have been caused by pollution. Furthermore, the proportions of factors such as accidents and overexploitation through hunting and fishing have demonstrated moderate differences at 12% and 15% respectively. 
The second chart shows that figures of wildlife population have fallen to a great extent troughout the period. From 2000 to the present the percentage of butterflies and bees has dropped appreciably by over 40% for both species. Then, freshwater fish has been the second endangered animal in the in the observed period. Also, there has been a descending trend for reptiles and birds.
On the other hand, the number of mammals such as bats and foxes has rised by 23% and by 9% respectively. What is more, otters population has gone up, despite the number of water voles has fallen slightly.
To sum up, although population decreased for most species, there also has been an increase in population for some of them.
