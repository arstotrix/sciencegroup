The chart given in the task shows us illiteracy rates in 2020 for developed countries, Latin America, East Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, Arab States and South Asia.
We can see that percentage of female illiteracy is expected to be highest in South Asia and Arab States and to be the lowest in developed countries.  The difference between those two rates is more than 50%. Male illiteracy rates are predicted to be highest in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, they likely will be about 30% higher than those in developed countries.  Moreover, illiteracy rates in Latin America and East Asia are expected to be comparably low (they do not reach more than 20% both for male and female).
Interestingly, proportions of male and female illiteracy rates depend on the region. It will be the smallest in Latin America (about 5:4 respectively) and it is expected to be the largest in East Asia (about 3:1 respectively). What is more, surprisingly, even in developed countries the rate of female illiteracy is 2 times higher than those of male illiteracy, which is true for Arab States as well. Nevertheless, it is interesting that the rate of illiterate women is higher than the percentage of illiterate men in all regions and probably still will be in 2020.
To conclude, this is what I have been able to observe from the chart given in the task.
