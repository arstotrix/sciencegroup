The line graph illustrates how the revenue share spent on petrol varies for different social classes in the UK and the USA. The graph has two axes: the vertical for the percent of income spent on fuel and the horizontal for social classes. The latter is divided into three sections: poorest, middle-income and richest, but despite we are not given any numbers, we can see that the value is gradual. There is a dotted line for the USA and a solid one for the UK. The solid line begins very close to a zero, than increases significantly in the section of middle-income, and the percentage keeps growing till its peak(4%) in the last half of the richest domain where it starts falling. The line for the USA starts slightly below 4%. The highest point(5%) is reached in the section of poorest and then it decreases till the very end. To sum up, the most significant difference between two counties is presented for the poorest class and the more is the income level the less is the difference.
