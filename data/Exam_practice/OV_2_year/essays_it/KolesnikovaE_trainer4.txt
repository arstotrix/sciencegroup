The chart demonstrates what proportion of their income people spend on petrol in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. There are three types of people which are divided according to their income: the poorest, middle-income and the richest.
As can be seen from the line graph, the biggest difference is between people from the first category. The least wealthy Americans spend about 5 percent of their income, and English people spend a lot less money – from 0.5 to about 3 percent. Nevertheless, in America the more people earn, the less they spend money on petrol, while in England the percentage continues to grow. It is worth to noting that people from America and the United Kingdom who are in the lower-high class spend the same on petrol – about 4 percent.
To sum up, in the United States of America the percentage of income which is spent on petrol falls while in the United Kingdom it increases.
