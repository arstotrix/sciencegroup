Nowadays there is such opinion that non-academic subjects at school (eg: physical education, cookery) should be removed from the syllabus. It is believed that it can help children to concentrate wholly on academic subjects.
I agree with this statement because such subjects that do not require academic excellence take the studentsâ€™ time. Instead of these subjects can be used those ones that students will take the exam, that would increase the level of students. Such important subjects as languages, mathematics, literature and others should be planned more often than 4-5 times a week. 
On the other hand, non-academic subjects help students to be prepared for life. Physical education allows maintaining physical health and makes the habit of a healthy lifestyle. Cookery teachers cooking and it would help not spending money to purchase food and fast food. There are many examples but the moral following: non-academic subjects teach us to live in real life.
In conclusion, I would like to say that all subjects are important in school, but particular attention should be given those that will be useful in the future.
