The given chart shows world illiteracy rates by region and by gender for the year 2020.
As we can see, in each region females are more likely to be illirerated that males. Another striking fact is that amount of illiteracy in Developed countries is absolutely different from an amount of illiteracy in Developing countries, where probably illiteracy is widely spread among the majority of people living there. Actually, the level of illiteracy for males in such regions as Sub-Saharan Africa, Arab States and South Asia is slightly similar. Also illiteracy of females in those regions varies not much.
To sum up, the level of illiteracy among South Asian people or in Arab States is shocking. The government of countries in these regions should definitely begin solving this problem and support growth of literacy. People all around the world should understand the importance of education.
