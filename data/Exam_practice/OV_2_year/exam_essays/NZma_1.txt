I like to use Yandex Dictionary website. It is a collection of two-way dictionaries which gather linguistic information from several online-dictionaries. Users, who are often students, pupils, laymen, or anyone, interested in languages, can search a word and find its different meanings with examples of how one can put this word in speech correctly. Synonims are also available. I keep going back to this dictionary service because it is fast, understandable and – for the practice goals – enough- of- info way to get the idea which word I should use to express my idea.
