The diagrams give information about manufacture of frozen fish pies composed by salmon in this specific case, peas, sauce and potato. We can see all ingredients on the first diagram. They lie in microwaveable container.

There are different deliveries of the product: the one of potatoes is up to one month and the one of salmon is every 12 hours or less due to the fact that the fish is fresh.

Potatos are cut in slices, boiled and the process ends with theis store which will be used in a certain moment of the production line of the salmon. Generally, how we wrote before, the fresh fish has a reduced time of delivery and after that, it is added to it lemon juice and salt. In this moment it is ready to steam in the oven. As soon as the product is cooked, skin and bones are moved away and an extra check is made by one person (inspector) who guarantees that the fish has been cleaned and the other ingredients can be added.

All ingredients are ready. Everything is in order: prepared peas, prepared sauce and the potatoes. At the end of this process, the product now can be wrapped, freeze and stored ready to go to the shop.
