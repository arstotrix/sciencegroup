The diagram below illustrate the process of  manufacturing the frozen fish pies.

As we can see, fish pies are prepared in two different steps. At the first step we bring potatoes to the factory (in one month). There they are cleaned and peeled and after that they are sliced and go to being boiled. Moreover, manufactures (producers) add chili to them and then potatoes are stored and are ready for the next step. At the next step we bring fresh salmons to the factory and prepare them for the fish pies. Producers (manufacturers) add lemon juice and salt to make it more delicious (it takes around 12 hours) and then they put salmons in a steam oven to steam it. After that skin and bones are removed from them by special people and at the end a special expert inspects the salmons. Then prepared peas and sauce are added to the salmons, which have already been inspected.

Finally, potatoes and fresh salmon are mixed together and are wrapped with a microwaveable container and after that producers freeze the finished pies. Now fish pies are ready to be stored.
