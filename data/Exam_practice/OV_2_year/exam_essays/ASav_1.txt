I like  using a social network which is called Facebook. Facebook connect people from different parts of the world. Living in Moscow I can share with my friends or relatives with little pieces of my live (photos, videos, notes). I can text there, call my friends without paying.

Hower, Facebook is not only for communicating. Also it gives its users much  useful information such as world news, upcoming events, recipes, ectâ€¦
Nowadays, everybody uses facebook (and young children, and older people). Facebook helps to promote buisness  and find new partness. Many people who use the Internet are  inregistrated on Facebook. Unfortunatelly, it takes a lot of time.
