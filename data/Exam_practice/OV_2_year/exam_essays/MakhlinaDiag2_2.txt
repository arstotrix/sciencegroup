When I was back at school I never eaten well, as school food was not really tasty.  And I think, I 

was doing pretty well with my studies. However, I still believe, that eating healthy can make 

you more effective in any kind of work, because, as it is clear from the name of this type of 

eating, it provides more benefits for your health. 

Moreover, I suppose, it is obvious from the star, that eating clean and tasty food could make 

person feel better. From my own experience I know, that eating less sugar makes you feel more 

energetic and makes your intellectual skills better. And of course, good food is extremely 

important for children, while they are still growing and their body need a right source of 

energy. And still the quality of the food in most Russian schools is at least contradictable. The 

reason for it is not very unexpectable: the government just has not enough money to provide 

schools with better food.

That is why nowadays in Russia it is only parents’ responsibility to look after children’s eating. 

On the other hand, it is impossible to supply your child with hot meal everyday when there are 

no facilities for heating food in school. Also eating healthy may sometimes costs a lot.

To sum up, I think, that providing food for school children should be the government 

responsibility as the health of the nation as a government-scale problem. But as it is not 

possible in every country, it often naturally becomes parents’ concerns.
