There is an opinion according to which children have need to eat healthy food at school to learn effectively. And I think that it is pretty close to the truth, but let us summarize all the pros and cons of this feature.

To begin with, we all understand that with healthy food our brains work better and hardly. If you eat healthy and tasty meal, you are in better mood, so, as a consequence, you can better concentrate on your work or study. In this case, the most important meal for children is breakfast, because it gives “strength” and cheerfulness for the whole day. But when children are staying in school for a long time, they need to be “charged” after the prolonged mental activity, and the healthy meal is a good solution. But not in all schools the meals are provided.

What can I say about my school in my home-town? In our dining room the meals were provided, but they were terrible! The food in our school was really untasty and, unfortunately, very expensive in addition to its awfal taste. So after two years at school, my sister and I started to eat in dining room our home-made meals.

In my opinion, healthy meal at school is a very important part of children’s learning process. It helps to be full of power and energy to study and, of course, it helps to be happier. School authorities are responsible to provide food for school children, but if they don’t do it, it’s up to parents to take care of their children’s health.
