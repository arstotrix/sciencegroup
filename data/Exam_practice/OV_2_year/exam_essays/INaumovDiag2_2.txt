 There is a spread belief, that healthy eating is a truly important part of a healthy lifestyle and should be stick by everyone. In particular, it is significant for children to have the ability to study properly. I agree with this statement and think that a school's administration and parents should be responsible for the way children eat.

   Firstly, parents must supply their children with a good breakfast. It is a well-known fact, that first meal of the day is the most important. Almost all of the pupils eat something at home and then go right to school to have their lessons. In school they do not have time to eat anything long.That is why breakfast should be consisted of nutritious and hearty ingredients, which provide enough energy for children till they have their second meal.

   Secondly, learners must be able to eat well at school. Working day can be quite long and involve many activities. Pupils who are hungry have trouble in concentrating and perceiving information, that is why their academic results suffer. It is also should be mentioned, that food in school is to be of full value too. Children love all kind of snaks, but their increasing effect of energy level is only short-term. There is a need that every school has a special dining room, where children can eat healthy food.

   To sum up, in my personal opinion having a good and healthy meal is very important for children to learn faster and be more energetic, but this problem should be solved by adult.
