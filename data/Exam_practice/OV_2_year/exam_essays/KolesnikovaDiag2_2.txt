We all need healthy food every day. If we do not do it, we begin to wilt and feel bad. Child is 

growing organism that requires twice as many vitamins and other nutrients. Their absence may 

have a negative impact on children’s development.

The majority of people thinks that eating fresh healthy food is very important for pupils. It is 

hard to do something if the stomach is empty. Children spend a lot of energy because they are 

almost always very moving: they play something, run etc. In addition, some of the energy is 

spent on studying. Studies have shown that children who are hungry have trouble concentrating 

and become slow learners. 

My parents take care about their children and their children’s health so they make us take a 

homemade food to school. Due to the fact that I ate well for a long school day, I had the strength 

to study well. However, very often pupils do eat something at school for a snack because they do 

not have anything from home and food from the school canteen they do not like. These snacks 

can be chips, stale cakes or only something to drink for the whole day. It is very harmful. 

Moreover, in such way children do not get enough so can not be productive to study.

In my opinion, it is up to parents and schools to make sure that children eat healthily. Schools 

should have good school canteens with delicious healthy menu. Parents should be more attentive 

and give their children to bring a packed lunch if they do not like school food.

In conclusion, a healthy meal will definitely help children to study more successfully. However, 

both parents and schools have a responsibility to make sure that this is provided for them.
