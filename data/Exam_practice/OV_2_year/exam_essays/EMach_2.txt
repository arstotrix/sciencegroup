This two diagrams introduce us with how frozen fish pies are being made in the manufactures.  This information is given to us in step by step scheme pictures.

There are two main parts of production line. The first part is preparing potatoes and the second part is processing the salmon. In general, potatoes production line is easier to organize and cheaper to maintain, so let’s have a quick look at the both parts of the process and make some comparisons.

First of all, what is important is that there is no human force needed for potatoes preparation. All is done automatically. While in salmon’s part there is for example a special person who inspects the quality of the product. There are also more difficulties with salmon delivery than with potatoes delivery, because it is essentional to deliver salmon in less the 12 hours to keep it fresh.

To sum up, making a fish pie turns out as being quiete a complex process as all cooking processes which involve dealing with fresh meat or fish.
