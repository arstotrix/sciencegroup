The two charts show information on crime in the United Kingdom for 2002. The first chart provides information about the relationship between age and crime. Quite expectedly, people donâ€™t commit crime before the age of eight. Then the crime rate growth gradually up to approximately 3 per cent for twelve-year-old teenagers. Between 12 and 16 years, crime rate increases very sharply up to 70 per cent, reaching 80 per cent at the age of 20, and then it decreases to 20 per cent at the age of 28 as sharply as it rose before. The older age is characterised by reducing crime rate, which falls to slightly below ten per cent at the age of 60. 
The second diagram classifies the property crime in the UK into 4 types: violent crime, property crime, drug crime and public order crime. The most commom crime in the United Kingdom is the violent crime with 46 per cent of total amount of crime committed. Property crime and drug crime are two times less prevalent with 23 per cent of the former and 22 per cent of the latter. The least frequent is the public order crime with only 9 per cent of it. 
As we can conclude, the peak number of crimes committed is between the ages of 12 and 28, so the most crimes are committed by teenagers and young people. Moreover, the most common type of crime is violent crime, what makes us think seriously.
