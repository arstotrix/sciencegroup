I want to describe the Russian National Corpus’ website. It’s  corpus, a sort of the storage of texts with special linguistic marks in them, like mode and tense of the verbs or case and number of the nouns. The RNC is used by various people to various purposes. Somebody who learn or teach Russian can search in the corpus some collocation of the words to see is it possible to say so, it is the only way or are they other variants that are more or less frequent. Linguista use this site for doing their researches, because you can search not only exact forms but also use lexico-grammatical search, or download the frequency lists.
