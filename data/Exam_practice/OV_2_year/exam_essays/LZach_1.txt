As a 21st century person I use a lot of websites in my everyday life, but my favorite is TUMBLR. This is a large blog platform containing all types of blogs dedicated to an endless variety of subjects. It offers an opportunity to read and follow otherâ€™s blogs (all new posts are displayed on your dashboard) and to create your own blog, where you can reblog all posts you like and create your own original content. You can publish all sorts of data you want: texts, pictures, photos, videos, gifs and music. You can also write  messages to other users. Tumblr is used mostly by young people, it is especially popular by young artists and writers who publish there their works to become popular and  get a feedback on what they do.
