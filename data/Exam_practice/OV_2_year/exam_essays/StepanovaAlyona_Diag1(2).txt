Nowadays many people believe that pupils should study only academical subjects at school.

I completely disagree with this statement. From my point of view, firstly, school should give children knowledge which is useful daily life. Because some parents are so busy that they do not have any time to explain their children, for instance, how to cook meal. Secondly, there should be some classes when pupils can relax and change a type of activity.
But,on the other hand, if you want to become a great scientist or just get a well-paid job in the future you should start preparing for entering a prestigious university when you are a child. Many academical classes can help you to make a choice of your future profession and can make your brain work in a progressive way.
In conclusion, I would like to say that we live in the century of the progress and that is why many people believe that at school non-academical subjects should be removed by classes of academical sciences.
