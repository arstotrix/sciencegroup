Some people are convinced that children effective learning includes a healthy meal at school and that. Others doubt it. There is also a discussion on whether the authorities should provide food for school children or if it should be provided by children’s parents. I will try to consider those issues. 

In my opinion, learning cannot be effective if children do not eat enough. Firstly, a child should have enough energy for to understand and memorise the information they are given. Secondly, it is much harder to get concentrated on learning when you are hungry and it is especially true for children. What is more, I believe that it is better if parents provide their children with a meal. As only this way all child’s preferences can be 

On the contrary, there is a viewpoint that food is not crucial in children’s learning process. The reason is that right after having a good meal a child should have some rest, which makes a study day much longer. Moreover, some people are convinced that school food should be provided by authorities for children not to carry to much weight to school.

 Although it might be true, I am still sure that children should eat healthily to learn effectively and that homemade food provided for students by their parents is much healthier.

In conclusion, questions of whether children should eat at school or not and if authorities should provide schools with food are widely debated.  Nevertheless, I believe that a good meal is crucial for a child when studding and that this meal should be given to children by their parents.
