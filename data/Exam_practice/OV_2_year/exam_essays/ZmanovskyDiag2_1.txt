According to given maps, there are a lot of changes in the range of facilities that can be used by tourists. All the changes took place at the left and central parts of an island, the right part was not changed. The geographical characteristics of the island had been remained throughout the construction period.
As we can see, a pier was constructed in order to make it possible and convinient to reach an island by a ship. Actually, there are two ships drawn near the pier. As for other transport issues, vehicle tracks were placed to connect the pier and a restaurant which was built to the North from the pier (at the opposite side of the island). Reception building is situated between the pier and the restaurant. There is a vehicle track around it.
One can consider establishing 15 new accomodations to be the main change of an image of the island. Six of them are on the left side from the reception. There is a footpath which connects a beach at the West end of the island (it is now allowed to swim at that area) and a circle vehicle track around the reception. Those accomodations are placed in a circle too.
The rest nine accomodations are located on the right side from the reception. Placed in a circle and connected with each other by a circled footpath, they lack a path to other facilities, though.
