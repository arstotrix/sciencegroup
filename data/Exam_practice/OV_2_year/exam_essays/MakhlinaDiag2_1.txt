On the picture, we could see two maps of the same island before and after construction of 

some tourist facilities. There four main features on the second map: the pier, the reception, the 

restaurant and the accommodations. There are also special swimming area, plenty of footpaths 

and the vehicle track. As we can see, there are two types of guests houses: the ones near the 

beach and the one ones that are further (there are more of them). I suppose, the second ones 

may be less expensive. And just between two types of the houses there is the reception where 

person could pay for his accommodation and get some information. However, as the island is 

not very large itself, there are still less than 200 metres between any of the houses and the 

beach. I think that is why there are not a lot of vehicle tracks on the island: you could go 

everywhere by feet. The pier and the restaurant are essential features for tourist island: you 

can not ship there without the first and you can not eat properly without the second. It is 

interesting that the right part of the island had not change. I think it was left as a place where 

tourists could look at the original island nature.
