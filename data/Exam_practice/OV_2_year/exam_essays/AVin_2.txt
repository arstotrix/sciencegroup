The diagrams provide the information about the process of manufacturing of frozen fish pies. A fish pie consists mainly from peas, fish and special sauce, it is placed in a microwaveable container and covered with thin-sliced potatoes.

The production of the pie begins with delivery of fresh salmon and potatoes. Salmon needs to be juiced by lemon juice and properly salted. Then it is cooked in a special steam oven, it’s bones and skins are removed and the quality of product needs to be inspected. The salmon is mixed with already prepared peas and sauces.

On the countrary to salmon, which can’t be kept for more than 12 hours before preparation, potatoes can be stored for a month. Then they’re cleaned and peeled (as with fish, the waste is disposed), properely sliced, boiled and chilled. Then it is stored and finally added to the mixture of salmon, peas and sauce.

Finally, the pie is wrapped in a container, properely freezed and stored or dispatched.
