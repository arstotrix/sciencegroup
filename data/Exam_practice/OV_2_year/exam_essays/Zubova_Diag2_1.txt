The given two maps show us the changes of island after the construction of some tourist facilities.

To begin with, there are a lot of kind of tents – important place for long-tern living or temporary accommodation. All these “houses” are connected between each other by footpath. Now after the construction you can go to the beach by this footpath.

As we can see, there is a reception in the centre of living area, so it is comfortable for all the tourists. In the Northern part of the island is situated a restaurant where tourists can pass the time in the evenings. For tourists’ comfort and convenience the new pier is appeared. From the pier you can go to the “high” sea on yachts.

What is important that the restaurant and the pier are connected among themselves by vehicle track, which is also surrounding the reception.

To sum up, there a lot of tourist facilities after the reconstruction of island and now it is more comfortable for living.
