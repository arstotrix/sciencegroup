To learn effectively, children need to eat a healthy meal at school. How true is this statement? 

Whose responsibility is it to provide food for school children?

There is an opinion, that a healthy food children get in school is an essential condition for 

learning effectively. 

On the one hand, there is a truth in this statement, because if children regularly get a 

healthy meal it will certainly help them to stay healthy and avoid some illnesses. Of course, it’s 

easier to concentrate on studying if one doesn’t have any problems with health. For example, when  

I was a school student, one of my classmates was often ill, and she had to stay at home for weeks 

instead of going to school several times a year, which caused a few problems with keeping up with 

other students and had an impact on hers grades. So, healthy food as a base for physical well-

being is very important.

On the other hand, many children like eating unhealthy food, and I think, despite that eating 

chocolate and cheeps is not very good for health, it can have a good effect on mood, which is quite 

important for studying productively.

To sum up the two previous paragraphs, it seems to me reasonable to provide a healthy 

meal, but not to exclude from school menu some sweetnesses or other unhealthy things children 

like to eat. 

I think, providing food for children is mainly a responsibility of schools, because that is the 

organization where parents will address if they will be not content with what they children eat 

during the school time. But it’s also good if the government will in some way control food available 

at schools and  even probably provide some help. 

To conclude, for children it’s important to have a good and balanced diet and school should 

pay some attention to what they provide in canteens.
