The two given diagrams show, how frozen fish pies are manufactured. The first one describes the structure of each pie, while the second one describes the process of manufacturing. As it is shown, the fish pie consists of fish and peas in some sauce with sliced potatoes on the top. The whole pie is placed in a microwaveable container. 

As the second diagram shows, the process of manufacturing of frozen pies is rather complicated. 

Before the stage of wrapping, potatoes and salmon are prepared separatly. Potatoes are delivered and after a certain period (not more than a month) come to a process of preparing. Then, potatoes pass throagh the stages of cleaning, pealing, slicing, boiling, chilling and storing for a time. As for salmon, after not more than 12 hours after delivering, it should be sprayed by lemon juice, salted and placed at the steam oven. Then, salmon passes through the stages of removing of skin and bones and inspection. After that, prepared peas and sauce are added and than the potato, which is already prepared, is placed on top of the mix. Then, the whole pie is wrapped, freezed and sent to the store.
