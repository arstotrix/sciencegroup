The two maps below show us an island, before and after the construction of some tourist facilities. At the first sign on two maps we can see that level of life increased very much. We can noticed big building in the centre of island, which named Reception. Also, we can see accomodation for people (tourists) on the left side and on the right side of the island. Footpath and vehicle track roads are done for tourists. If we would look at the left side of the second map we can notice beach line with swimming part.  Of course, tourists want to eat and one big restaurant is located in the centr of island behind of Reception. Also, tourists have sea-activities because we can see two yachts and one beautiful small pier.

	Summarise the information I can say  that it was very big tourism-project which are used much money. After the construction of some tourist facilities 80% percents of the island are changed by this project.
