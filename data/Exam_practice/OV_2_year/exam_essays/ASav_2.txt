Fish pie production line.

The diagrams give information about the manufacture of frozen  fish pies that consists of fish (salmon), peas, souce and potatoes, which are contained in microwave container.
There are two different delivery lines of the pie: first for potatoes (up to one month); second for fresh salmon (12 hours or less). The salmon must be dilivered  very quiqly, because it is fresh.

When salmon is delivered it is poured with lemon juice and salted. After that it goes to steam oven, then skin and banes are removed. At the next stage salmon meat is inspected by a worker. Next are added ingredients that remained (piece, sause). In the end is added the last ingredient â€“ potato.

Hower, before adding potato to the fish pie, it is automatically cleaned, peeled, sliced, boiled, and chilled.

The last stage is to wrap the finished product and freeze it. Then the product is stored until being dispatched to the costumer.

To sum up, this diagram shows a very long way of separated products to tasty fish pie.
