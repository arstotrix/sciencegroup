The diagrams show a fish pie and the process of its production.
 
A fish pie consists of potatoes, peas, fish and sauce. The upper layer is formed by sliced potatoes and there are peas and pieces of fish in sauce underneath. The pie is sold in containers suitable for microwaves.

The production has two branches at first. The first one is the preparation of potatoes and the second one concerns salmon. As far as the potatoes are concerned, they are delivered and stored for not more than a month. They are cleaned and peeled, which also includes waste disposal. After that they are sliced, boiled, chilled and stored until they are added to the pie.

Salmon is delivered in a fresh state. Lemon juice and salt are added, which takes place no more than 12 hours from the moment of delivery. Subsequently, salmon is cooked in a steam oven, then skin and bones are removed manually. At this stage, waste disposal is necessary. The following inspection is also manual.

Afterwards, the formation of a pie begins. Prepared peas and sauce are added and potatoes are put at the top. Then the pie is wrapped, frozen and packs of pies are ready for storage or dispatch.
