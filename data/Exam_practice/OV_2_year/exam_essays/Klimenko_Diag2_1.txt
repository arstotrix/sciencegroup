The given picture shows two maps of the same island before it has been reconstructed as a place for tourists and after it.

Before the construction of tourists facilities it was completely inhabitant island with two palm forests at the left and at the right of the central part of it and a beach on the west coast.

After the construction the island has changed very much. At the South coast there is a pier large enough to two boats fit in. From the South coast to the north coast where the restaurant is placed leads a vehicle track. The vehicle track surrounds a reception house that is situated between the restaurant and the pier. Not far from the reception and before the east palm forest there are nine accommodation houses with a footpath connecting all of them. The other six accommodation houses are on the left of the reception and they are also connected with a footpath that than leads to the beach were is a swimming zone.
