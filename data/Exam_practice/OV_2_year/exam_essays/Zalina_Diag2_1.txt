On the map we can see an island before and after some reconstruction made. As we can see, the accommodation buildings were built in circules and the reception was built in the middle between them. The restaurant was built on the north from the reception and the vehicle track connecting theese two buildings goes on to the south straight to the pier where the sailing area was constructed. The footpaths connect all accommodation buildings with vehicle track and with the beach area on the west part of the island that had been accompanied in the swimming zone.

All the tourists facilities expand for about 50 metres from north to south and for about 150 metres from east to west.

As we can also see on the map the eastern part of the island still had not been supplied with any kind of facilities as well as no swimming, sailing or other thone has been provided on the sea area on the north side of the island.
