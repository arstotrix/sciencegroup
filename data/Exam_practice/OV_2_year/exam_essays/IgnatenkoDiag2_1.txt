The drawings given in the task illustrate the two different maps of an island: one before the

construction of tourist facilities and another after that. On the first map, which is a bare island, we 

can see some trees and a beach on the West. On the other map many facilities are added. The 

North part of island now has a pier, and the beach on the West is able for swimming. Reception is 

constructed on the centre of the island and closer to the South edge we can see the restaurant, 

which are connected with each other and with the pier by a vehicle track. On the left and on the 

right are situated fifteen houses of accommodation. They are connected with footpaths, and the 

one on the left also leads to the beach. Itâ€™s pleasantly to note that the most part of trees was left on 

its place. So, despite the fact that the island was well equipped for tourist, it seems that nature was 

not affected too badly.
