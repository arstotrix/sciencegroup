The two maps below illustrate an island that has no any tourist facilities on the first map and the second one includes the construction of needed facilities.

 To begin with, if we look on the first map, we can only see some palm trees, sea and beach, most of the places are empty. But on the improved version of the island we can admire a lot of small cottages, which guests can rent and in which they can stay.

 Moreover, In the centre of the island there is situated the reception area, where tourists can check in and make a reservation. In front of the reception you can see on the one side the restaurant, where you can have a meal and relax, and on the other side of the reception there is the straight road to the sea from the pier for boating.

 Furthermore, after the construction of some tourist facilities there was constructed the swimming area with the swimming pool next to the beach.

 To conclude, we can see that many facilities were established on the island in order to provide tourists with all needed facilities (accommodation and food area, entertainment, road tracks and so on). We should also admit that the idea not to cut the trees after the reconstruction was great, because guests can admire amazing views around them during their rest and relaxation on the island.
