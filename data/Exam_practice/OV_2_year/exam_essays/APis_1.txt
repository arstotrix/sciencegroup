Speaking about my favourite websites I couldn’t  mention such image-board as pinterest.com. This website provides great amount of different pictures, sorted by cathegories like colour, theme, picture or photo and many others.

It may sounds silly for the first time, but this website can be very useful. For example, if you suffer from the lack of imagination or if you need some ideas about your look, design of your flat, dishes for your party and what not Pinterest.com can be also useful for people that fond of design, architecture, drawing and other fields connected with art. 

To tell the truth, for me it can also be a “time-killer”.  Sometimes I suffer from insomnia and during this period I can spend hours listing hundreds of pictures. Sometimes such activity helps me to fall asleep.
