There is no doubt that the Internet is changing the world and the society. In particular, it is at the forefront of the current progress which results in a great many phenomena becoming obsolete. Therefore, some people suppose that newspapers might soon cease existing. However, there are several points that reinforce the opposite opinion.
The popularity of the Internet as a source of information is undoubted. Firstly, it requires fewer expenses both to provide and to obtain information. Secondly, availability of the Internet access is increasing with the technological progress. What is more, the Internet provides the opportunity to store overwhelmingly huge amount of data, whereas archives of traditional newspapers take far more space and are inconvenient to conduct search in.
However, newspapers are still in great demand since it is much more convenient for a lot of people to read traditional newspapers. To begin with, text on paper is perceived more easily and it is possible to write necessary notes, which is crucial for some people. Moreover, paper copies do not depend on the quality of connection and, therefore, people cannot be interrupted by the problem of access when reading a traditional newspaper. In addition, newspapers are much easier to distribute which may be vital on some occasions.
I presume that the number of newspapers produced may decrease but a paper version will not die out entirely. The newspapers might exist in both formats and the Internet one may be more extended but there will still be demand for a traditional version of newspaper.
