A fish pie is dish made of peas, fish, sauce and potatoes that are put in a microwaveable container.

Before fish pies go on sale they go through several stages of the manufacture.   

The process starts with the delivery of fresh salmon. After that it is seasoned with some lemon juice and salt. The seasoned salmon is steamed, filled and then inspected. Itâ€™s important to note that the time gap between delievery and steaming cannot be more than 12 hours. The next stage is adding prepared pease and sauce. And the last stage before wraping the pies, freezing and storing them is adding pre-cooked potatoes. They usually go through several stages as well. After delievery, they get cleaned, peeled, sliced, boiled, chilled and then stored untill they get into the fish pies. 

To sum up, the manufacture of frozen fish pies is a complicated process that includes many different stages.
