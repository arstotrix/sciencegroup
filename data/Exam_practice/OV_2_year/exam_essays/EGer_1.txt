Currently I frequently use Russian National Corpus, which is available online. It was created approximately ten years ago and it is being developed now. The corpus comprises more than 220 million tokens, which is fewer than there are in rutenten but unlike rutenten, it Russian National Corpus is balanced which is essential for reseach.

There are several subcorpora in Russian National Corpus, for instance, the Corpus of poetry and the parallel corpus, and new ones are implemented from time to time. The corpus is morphologically tagged and a part of it includes disambiguation done manually.

The important feature is the developed search opportunities. It is possible to search by a token or a lemma, specify grammar tags. A lot more parameters are available for searching.
The corpus is used mainly by linguists who carry out research concerning Russian. Nevertheless, it can be used as reference of one is interested in the usage of a word.
On the whole, Russian National Corpus provides the opportunity to apply both qualitative and quantitative methods in the research and also serve as reference. Unfortunately, few people not famillar with linguisties are aware of its existence.
