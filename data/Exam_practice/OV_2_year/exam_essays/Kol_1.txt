Iâ€™d like to tell you about such website as Kinopoisk. This site is dedicated to film and cartoons. There are a lot of information about every movie what you want. When, where and how it was made, what actors participated in it etc. Also there are some information about different actors and actresses, their biographies. The website is equipped with convenient functions and pleasure design. Yoy can register and make your own special lists of movies what you had watched and would like to watch. As I think , kinopoisk gives people the opportunity to know everything about their favourite films and cartoon, to find friends with the same interests and to have access to different trailers. This site is free and every person can use it.
