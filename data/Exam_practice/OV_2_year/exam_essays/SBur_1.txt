My favourite website that I really like to use is buro24/7.com. This site is particularly about fashion and healthy lifestyle. There are a lot of columns that are written by famous people and bloggers who have an interest in fashion industry. The site is come under several sections such as: beauty, fashion, architecture, culture e.g. and it is extremely convinient to use because you can choose one section that you are interested in and the site will provide you only with information on a specific theme. Actually, I believe that every person all around the world is interested in fashion uses this site. Even boys can find something important for them, for example, music news or new released albums. I extremely like this website because of its bright and stylish interface and new improvements every day.
