The website I really like using is Grouple. This website is devoted to different kinds of modern asian culture such as japanese anime and manga, korean manhwa and doramas, various books of modern asian authors. This website is very popular with people interested in asian culture, with people who want to practice listening to japanese and korean speech watching anime and doramas as all the content on this website is provided with subtitles as well. Grouple also gives its users an opportunity to share their own translations of manga or anime. As for me, I keep visiting this website because my favourite series are being uploaded there weekly and there I can find any other manga, anime or dorama I would like to watch or read or some news about future releases.
