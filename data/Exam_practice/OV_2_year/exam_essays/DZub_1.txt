As my boyfriend is hockey player, I am trying to be interested in his favourite game, so I often use the website of Continental Hockey League. This website is very useful because it gives a lot of information about all the teams of KHL, their players, etc. If you want to know more about history of your favourite team or its anthem, you can use this site! Of course, there is information about certain games. I often use it to watch online translation of our favourite team Salavat Yulaev because this team is from Ufa and we canâ€™t go to all the matches to the ice rink.

I think that this website is used not only by hockey fans or hockey players, but also their lovers because at this site there is a online-shop. And also this site will be useful and interesting for journalists (i.e. sport journalists).
