These two pictures show information about how an island changed after some tourist facilities were built on it.




Considering the first map, that represents the island before any constructions on it, we can see a blank territory, on which there were only a few palms and a beach zone in the west of it.

Turning to the second map, it can be seen that there are quite a lot facilities have been built on the island. The first thing to be noted is that there are now 15 tends have been constructed for tourists to live in. 9 of them, constituting a circle in the middle, are connected by a foot path with each other, and 6, surrounding some palms in the west side of the island, are connected not only with each other, but also with a beach zone. There is also a reception in the middle of the island and a vehicle track which is around it and which connects it with a restaurant on north and a pier on south. 




Overall, these changes have made the island a great place for tourists to spend time.
