The diagrams illustrate a structure which generates electricity from wave power.
The mechanism consists of a turbine, a column, a chamber. Air passes through the turbine outwardly, while water wave rises. Then air again passes through the turbine, while sea wave leaves the sea wall.
The mechanism generating electricity from sea waves sits on the cliff.
The Diagram A shows a process when waves come to sea wall, and the diagram B gives information about a process when it leaves the cliff.
The Electricity appeares from roatation of turbine and the stream of air.
