It’s a complicated question, whether the food can increase learning abilities itselves or not.

On my opinion, even if it can’t no one could deny that the hunger can decrease an ability to concentrate and the concentration is an important part of the process of learning. Me, for example, I’m never able work properly if I miss breakfast. On the other hand, big amount of food in stomach can make one sleepy and fast consumption of a meal isn’t good for health so it’s important to give a big break for a lunch. The quality of food is also important because nowadays children eat a lot of junk food and became unhealthy. Eating a pizza or a burger gives a lot of energy and reduce hunger but not for a long time, it’s way more better to feed children healthy meals with greens, and fruits, and products that accord to some scientists can help them to learn (like nuts, for example).

I think that the gouvernement should be responsible for providing food to schools because it’s an important part of the learning process. This food doesn’t have to be expensive because not all children have money for it. Of course, maybe it’s  easier when parents of each child will decide themselves what he or she need to eat (at least in case if he or she has any food allergies) and will give them home – made lunch. But cheap (or even free) school lunch may be more affordable to poor families then home-made.  And if all children in class will eat the same food there will be no room to bulling someone for what they eat.
