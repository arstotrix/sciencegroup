As I think, many people of my ages do, I like using the website “vk.com”. It gives a lot of communication oportunities: sharing some posts, photos, videos or just short messages. There are also loads of music and even books, which are difficult to find on other sites and I find it very useful. As I mentioned above, many people of my age use this site, so it is mostly used by teenagers, but people of other ages use it too.
