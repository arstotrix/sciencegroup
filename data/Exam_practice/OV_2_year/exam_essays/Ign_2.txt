The diagrams given in the task illustrate the process of frozen fish pies manufacturing. The firts one shows the pieâ€™s cut, where we can see all constituents. There is a layer with a potato on the top , on the bottom we can see some peas, fish, sauce, all together placed in microwaveable container.

The second and the last diagram illustrates the manufacturing process. We can see two conveyors involved. Both lines beggin from manufactury components delivery. First conveyor works only with potato: it cleans, peels, slices, boils, chills and finally stores the vegetable and passes it on the second line. The second conveyor beggins with preparing salmon by adding lemon juice and solt and passing it to the steam oven. After that skin abd bones are removed from the salmon manually and the fish is inspected. The next stage is mixing the salmon with prepared peas, sauce and potato. Eventually, comes product wraping. After the pie is prepared, it is frozen and stored or dispatched.

To conclude, it is interesting to note that almost the whole process is automatizated and only skin and bones removing and inspection are done by people.
