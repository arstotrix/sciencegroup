Two maps provide the information about how an island has changed after the construction of some facilities for tourists. 

To begin with, the island was completely empty before special places for tourists were built. As we can see from the map of the island after the construction, now a tourist who comes to the island can find where to eat (a restaurant), where to go swimming securely (a beach with a special swimming zone), where to stay for a night (there are 15 special guest houses). After arriving on the island a tourist can see the pier from where they can reach a reception or, if going further, a restaurant. Guest houses are situated on the right and on the left of the reception. There is also a footpath leading tourists through accommodation area to the beach, if turning on the left on the way from the pier to the reception.
