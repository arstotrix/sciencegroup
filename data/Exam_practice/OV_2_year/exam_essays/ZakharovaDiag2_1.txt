The given illustration represents the comparison of an island before and after the construction of some objects for tourists. 

In general, we can see that the island appearance has changed dramatically and a great amount of new buildings and other tourist facilities has appeared.

First of all, it can be appeared that the pier was build in the southern part of the island and in the western end of the island, where the beach is, was equiped and prepared for tourists swimming. Concerning the buildings: the reception and the restaurant were placed in the middle part of the island and some accomodation shaks were build in the both sides of the reception. Also there are some footpath routes and a vehicle track on the island at the moment. The vehicle track leads us from the pier and around the reception right to the restaurant. The footpath goes through all the accomodation places and then turns to the beach.
