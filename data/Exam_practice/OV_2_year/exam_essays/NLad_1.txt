Vk is a social networking website. It’s a free website that allows you to keep in contact with friends or find people you’ve lost touch with.

It offers many capabilities for users. You can send pictures, audio, messages. You have a profile page with information and status updates, so you can tell everyone what you are doing.

It is very popular social networking for young people in Russia. Every student has a profile of it. We communicate with my group in this social networking website.
