The supplied picture illustrate the information on how the construction of some tourist facilities changed the life on an island.

The picture consists of two maps. The first map shows us how the island looked like before the reconstruction and the second map gives us a view of the same island but with significant changes. As we can see the island was practically empty, there were no buildings, no areas for entertaining, no swimming zones. Obviously, there were no tourists at all because they didnâ€™t have some place to stay even for a night. However, after one reconstruction was made the appearance of the island definitely changed. We can see, that a hotel  reception in the center as divided accommodations with bungaloes was built there, also a big restaurant near the sea was constructed. Moreover a pier for boats and ships appeard not far from the entrance to the reception. Thus, tourists from all around the world can visit the island and spend their holidays at the hotel, swimming in the sea, laying on the beach and eating fresh food in the restaurant.

In addition, with the help of reconstruction of the island the government surely made the income of citizens much more bigger.
