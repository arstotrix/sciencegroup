Prepared food is a very comfort type of food if we focus on the time needed to make it ready for eating by a consumer.  From the manufacturerâ€™s point of view it is, however , much more complex.

As for example, we can see the diagrams representing the process of making Frozen fish pies. In such pies there are several important parts: fish pieces and peas which are drown into special sauce and the line of boiled potato at the top of the pie. All the pie is served with the microwaveable container.

Before a pie is bought by consumer, it makes a long way through different parts of manufacturing process.  First of all, potatoes and fresh salmon are delivered separately to the manufactory in the period of up to one month and 12 hours or less respectively.  Potatoes are cleaned, peeled, and sliced. Boiling is the next step, after which potatoes need chilled. Fresh salmon, spiced with lemon juice and salt, goes through a steam oven , and then skin and bones are removed by manufactory workers. (this part is later administred by an inspector). Salmon is mixed with peas and sauce; then, potatoes are added. Wrapping machine brings a whole pie together and packs it. The last part is freezing, after which pies are ready to go to supermarkets, stores, dispatches.
