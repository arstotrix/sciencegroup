One of the most wonderful websites I’ve ever seen is “Deviantart”. This website gives its users a chance do share their visial art creations with other people. Deviatart is a big internet platform where you can upload your paintings, and photos. This website also has very simple and convinient search system including tags and categories. To my mind, this website gives people a great opportunity to find people sharing their interests and hobbies. A lot of artists, photographers, cosplayers and models use this website. But a lot of people who doesn’t creat anything have a profile on “Deviantart” : you can just make a gallery of works you like. As for me I usually use this website the same way.
