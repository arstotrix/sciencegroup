It is believed that school children should lead a healthy lifestyle and eat a healthy meal at school in order to learn better.

 From my point of view, children should eat healthy products not only at school, but everywhere. On the one hand, if we are talking about the ability to learn and study more effectively, I assume that it is more important to have a square breakfast (meal) at home than to eat at school. It is known that if you want to spend your day useful, you should have a good breakfast because It improves our mood, helps to restore energy and work better throughout the whole day.

 On the other hand, there are school children who study until late and it is important for them to eat a healthy dinner (lunch) at school. Firstly, when a child gets hungry at school he can not concentrate on his lessons and he can not understand all the material that the teacher gives him. Furthermore, if we speak about a healthy meal, I think that all children prefer more eating unhealthy chocolates and biscuits that are sold at school's canteens rather than choose healthy food. For example, when my sister studied at school, she liked to eat only unhealthy crisps and choco pies, and these eating habits affected her educational process badly. I believe that school administration is responsible for providing a healthy meal at school and also parents should not be lazy and should prepare their children some healthy food from home and give them in order to eat it at school.

 All in all, I assume that healthy food is very useful for children in order to provide their growing body with healthy products and vitamins. It also gives them extra energy and helps to work more efficiently. So, parents and school administration should take steps to provide their children with healthy meal at school and at home.
