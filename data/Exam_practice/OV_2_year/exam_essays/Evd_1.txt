There are a lot of websites that I use every day, but my favourite one is TED. It is a global community which welcomes people from every discipline and culture and unites people who share common interests. I suppose that this website helps people to understand the world better, to learn deeper a subject they are interested in (for example literature, science, technologies, music). It also allows us to relax and just to explore the world around us. Speaking about people who use it, I am sure that TED is popular both with adults and teenagers. 

All in all, I really enjoy TED, because it broadens horizons and helps to relax from boring lessons.
