First of all, a pier has been constructed in the cove on the southern side of the island. From the pier, a blacktop vehicle trach has been laid to the reception and restaurant buildings, which have also been built recently. The restaurant is situated on the northern  side of the island, overlooking the sea, while the reception is more or less ?distant from the northern and southern shores.

To the east and west of the track, a number of cottages have been constructed for tourist accommodation. Those are interconnected by footpaths. There is now a designated swimming area near the beach.

The entire eastern side of the island remains unpopulated. It is interesting that no vegetation has been cut down during the construction process â€“ all the palm trees remain where they were previously.

Also worth noting is the fact that the footpaths interconnecting the tourist accomodations have been arranged in a shape somewhat reminiscent of palm fronds.
