Nowadays governments of all countries invest great amounts of money in different kinds of arts and they would rather spend their money on public services. Some people are sure that our states can use this money wiser and spending of taxpayer funds on «cultural» purposes is a waste of money.
To be honest, I can’t agree with this statement, while. Of course, the situation is indeed very complex and is connected with the notion of art and it’s functions itself. It’s not quite clear, what is the Art and what role music, theater etc. have played in history of mankind and what is the reason of it’s existence in modern societies. However, we can not deny that there must be a practical and applied function of it, otherwise it would not have being existed with the appearance of Homo Sapiens. And if the arts are represented in any cultures of any historical period – why don’t we need to protect and support different kinds of it?
We have stated that the pursuit of art is in our human nature. However, strictly speaking, it is for society to do some kind of art. Even the most poor societies exhibit a strong pursuit of art, they draw pictures and play music while their lives are endangered every single moment of every single day. Therefore, why shouldn’t our prosperous society take care of art and artists.
The final reason that governments should support art with investments is that in our industrial society it will be very hard for aet to survive, while not all kinds of art are able to gain money. If artist are forced to act and create by economical laws, it will be possible that after 100 years there will be no art at all.
To sum up, I want to say that public services are also extremely important, and governments should always firstly think about citizens and their needs. However, Art is a need of every human being, too.
