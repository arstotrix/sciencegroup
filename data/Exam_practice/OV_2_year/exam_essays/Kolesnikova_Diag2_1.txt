These two maps demonstrate different changes that happend on the island after upgrading this place for tourism where were made accommodation and entertainment facilities.

Turning to the first map which means the island before constraction, it can be seen that there are a lot of free space in the centre of the island. On the right side of the land there is a palm forest and on the left side there is a beach.

Moving to the other map, as it is evident from it, there are some facilities have been built. First of all, was made a reception that is almost in the centre of the land. On both sides of it were built 15 houses as an accommodation for tourists. Behind the reception was made restaurant. On the opposite sea shore was built a pier. The beach is for relaxing and swimming in the sea now. All the elements of  the complex are connected with each other by roads. From the pier to restaurant and around the reception there is a vehicle track. Every part of the accommodation system and the beach are connected by the footpath.

Overall, after the construction, the island has become an amazing place to rest.
