To learn effectively, children need to eat a healthy meal at school. 

    Healthy food choices are not only a significant issue for children but also for 

adults as well. Everyone needs to eat healthy and maintain a nutritional diet in 

order to fully maximize their cognitive and physical stamina throughout the day. 

But, how true is this statement and what do people think about it? 

    Most adults agree with the notion that children should eat a healthy food. It 

will be a problem for children if they are not getting enough vitamins from their 

diets. When a child is hungry or suffering from malnutrition due to poor diet, he is 

unable to absorb lessons from school. As a result, children with poor diet will be 

at risk of becoming poor students. If you were to compare children who eat 

breakfast to those that don't, you would see a stark difference in the academic 

performance of these two groups, a difference that would significantly favor the 

children who ate breakfast. Academic performance depends not only on healthy 

diet but also on the teachers, who must demonstrate enthusiasm when teaching 

their students. 

     Unfortunately, nowadays many parents prefer to give money, then prepare 

healthy meal at home. Because of that, some children buy food at school canteen. 

Children don’t have experience, or understanding of the importance of a well 

balanced and healthy diet. When the decision is given to them, with their parents 

money, they often make poor dietary choices. That is why it is important for 

parents to prepare their meals for them.

      In my opinion, healthy food will give energy to children and will greatly benefit 

children’s cognitive function. All parents are obliged protect their children from 

eating bad products and to prepare  good meals for their children at home and at 

school.
