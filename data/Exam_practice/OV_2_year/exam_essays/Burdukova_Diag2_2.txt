In today’s fast-moving world many people, and I am among them, maintain that to be more successful at studies children need to eat healthy food and the government should take responsibility to provide meals for schools.

First of all, children spend the biggest part of the day at school, therefore they don’t need to be hungry even if they have breakfasts and dinners at home. Moreover, meals themselfs need to consist of healthy and nutritious products to provide children vitamins and some other elements which help the brain stay working.

Also children need to know how to keep fit from childhood and they need to know that having a chocolate bar of a pocket or biscuits for snack is really harmfull for their health even if it is tasty. I believe that if the person has a balanced diet he will be in a good mood which will help him to learn or work effectively.

For instance, when I don’t follow my diet and eat a lot of sweets and junk food I fell exhausted, get tired very rapidly and can’t concentrate on some important things always losing attention.  But when I’m trying to eat healthy meals I usually get powerfull and efficient at what I am doing.

Furthermore, I am sure that the government should provide food for school children. As far as know it is cheaper for parents to pay for food from government than to buy it in supermarkets. And also if the government takes responsibility to buy and provide healthy food for children at school it will be better organized and easier to get contacts of some farmers or manufactures that make this type of products.

To sum up, I believe that it is serious question and the government should think about food at schools more properly because it is really important nowadays to eat healthy meals in order to learn more effectively.
