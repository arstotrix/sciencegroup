The given diagrams show the process of fish pie production and a contain of the fish pie itself.

The production consist of two lines: potato line and salmon line. Potatoes are delivered up to one month. On the manufacture they go to the line, where they are automatically cleaned and peeled. Than waste is trown out into special waste disposal. While the peelless potatoes are cutted into round and thin slices. After cutting, slices are boiled in the special pot which is linked with the chilling machine. After being chilled, potatoe slices get stored and go into potatoe dispancer which is placed on salmon-preparation line. 

As for the salmon, it’s delivered much more frequent than potatoes, no more than 12 hours from the fishing boats to the factory, because fish can’t stay fresh for a long time. On the line fish is spread with lemon juice and salt and after it’s cooked with a steam. Factory workers remove skin and bones and than their work is inspected. There is only one place in the factory where they use people insteaf of machines. Further on the line salmon is mixed with peas and sauce and covered by potatoe slices, it can be seen on the other diagram, that the potatoe slices are only on the top of the pie. Finally, the pies are wrapped, frozen and delivered to the stores.
