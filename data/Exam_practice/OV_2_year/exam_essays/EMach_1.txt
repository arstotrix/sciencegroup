I really like lingualeo.ru. This websites gives its users a lot of opportunities to study english in various ways. For example, you can read a book in english and then learn the words from reading that you didn’t understand, by playing games. However, it’s basically designed only for the speakers of Russian. It can be used not only by students, but also by teachers who wants to include interactive materials in their lessons.
