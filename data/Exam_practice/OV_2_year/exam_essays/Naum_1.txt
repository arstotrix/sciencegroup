I have been using Internet for a couple of years and since then Iâ€™ve chosen some websites that I visit daily. But vk.com is the one I most often browse. It is a social network and one of the most popular websites in my country.

The website helps its users to stay in touch with their friends and learn new people, but there are a lot of different opportunities that it gives. For example, users can update and broadcast their news, play games, watch videos and listen to music for free.

Almost everybody have an account on vk.com nowadays, but main visitors are teenagers.
