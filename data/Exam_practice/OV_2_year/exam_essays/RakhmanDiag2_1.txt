In the given picture we can see two maps, showing an island before and after the construction of some tourist facilities. At the first map we can see a small island, which is about 200 meters from East to West and about 50-60 meters from North to South with only one beach on its West coast. According to this map, there were no constructions on the island before it moved to the condition which is showed on the second map. A lot of facilities such a reception building, a restaurant and 15 accommodation buildings have been constructed. The reception building can be found in the middle of the island, surrounded by a vehicle track, which is leading from the pier in the South part of an Island to the restaurant, which is located in it's North part. The accommodation houses are divided into two parts, consisting of 6 and 9 buildings. The bigger part is the most eastern part of this tourist village, the smaller is situated on the other reception's building hand. There are footpaths, connecting accommodation houses and leading to the beach, in which there is a swimming area now.
