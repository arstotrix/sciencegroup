Having an appropriate meals and following the eating regime during the day is very important for children as they need to get enough vitamins and energy to grow and study well. As all we know the traditions of providing childrens with meals are different in different cultures.

In major countries parents pay monthly fee to school cafeteria which provides their children with meals once or twice a day according to the policy of the school. Unfortunately, in most schools it means quite poor and not really tasty dishes but there are always portions for each student so none of them and up starving unless they choose not to eat anything themselves. Most usually it is possible to make an arrangement with the cafeteria if a child has any allergies or other medically encouraged diet.

On the other hand, in many countries parents prepare some food for their children at home and they bring it to school in lunch boxes to have a snack during the brakes. This way it may be cheaper to follow childâ€™s special diet if there is one and parents can organize meals for their children according to their budget or preferences. However, such lunc boxes do not assume child to have any hot meal during the day and they are usually taken away from younger students by bullies. 

As for me, I strongly believe that nourishing and hot meals are very important for children as they spend most part of the day at school, get tired and need to recharge from time to time in order not to miss anything and keep up with their studies effectively. According to my own experience, lunch boxes can be rather havy or large so it might be difficult or inconvenient for child to bring it to school by him/herself. So for me the most preferable way of providing children with food at school is the one made by school cafeteria. All in all, one can always start providing their child with lunch boxes even if there is a cafeteria at school.
