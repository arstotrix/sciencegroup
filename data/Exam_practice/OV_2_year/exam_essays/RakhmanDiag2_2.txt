Most people agree that to learn effectively, children need to eat a healthy meal at school. But whose responsibility is to provide food for children? Some people say that it is the school who has to feed them, some people say that that's parents' responsibility.
 I think that a healthy meal is an extremely important part of a successful education. When students are hungry, they think only about food, not about studying. For example , when I was at school, my parents gave me money for buying a meal. Sometimes I preferred to save the money for myself, not to spend it in school. That leaded to the lack of the attention I paid to the lessons, because the only thing that I wanted was the big plate of something tasty and surely not the new portion of knowledge. Thus, I think the good meal can not be excluded out of the school student's timetable.
 It is not an easy question who has to feed children in school. On the one hand, that should be parents' responsibility, because they feed their children anyway, why shouldn't they give them food to school? On the other hand, a sandwich is not so healthy as a plate of soup, which is not very easy to take with you.
 I think, the school has to provide the hot meal to its students, but it has not to be free. This way, parents will pay for their children as they have to do, but the children will still get a healthy hot meal instead of a sandwich or something like this.
