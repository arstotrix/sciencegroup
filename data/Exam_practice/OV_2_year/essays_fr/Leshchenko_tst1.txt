The graph shows the amount of 3D cinema screens  from 2005 to 2011. The chart shows the number of 3D cinema releases from 2005 to 2012.
The graph indicates that the change in the number of 3D cinema screens was minor from 2005 to 2008 (below 10,000 for three years). The sharp rise began with the 2008 when the figures increased to 40,000. 
The chart demonstrates that the change in the number of film releases was always steady from 2005 to 2008. Animation appeared in 2008 and quickly began to grow to 2012. From 2008 to 2010 animation and live action were equal (it was less than 10). From 2011 to 2012 animation became more than live action.
To summarise, the main features of 3D cinema screens and film releases were such that the increase in number was impetuous  from 2008 to 2012, animation prevailed over live action since 2011 to 2012.
