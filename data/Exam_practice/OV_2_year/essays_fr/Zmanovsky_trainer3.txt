Given graph represents data on how much income (in %) people of the United States and the United Kingdom spend on petrol for their cars. People from both countries are divided into three groups according to their wealthyness: people with poor income, middle-income citizens and the richest ones. The horizontal axe shows the income, and the vertical axe is reserved for the percentage of income spent on petrol. There are two lines on the graph correspond to the countries mentioned above.
Forms of lines and their underlining functions differ for some reason. 4% of income is spent on petrol in the group of the poorest people of the United States. There is a little increase within this group up to 5.2% approximately for people of middle-poor income. For the rest part of the graph you can see a slow linear decreasing of money spent on petrol down to 2.5% for the richest people. Data form the United Kingdom show another trend: the poorest people spend about 0.5% of income on petrol, and this number grows into eight times more number as the income of people grows. This growth stops as soon as you are getting closer to the richest people and then the vector is changed. For the most rich people of the UK it is about 3.5% of income spent on petrol.
Why there is such a difference between the data from the UK and the US? It is very difficult to answer this question not taking into account some other social variables and factors. So, the data is inconclusive. However, we can expliciate the difference: both for the UK and the US there is a growth of expenses in the beginning of a graph, but there is a distance between growth peaks (for the UK — up to the richest people, for the US — within the poorest people group), after which there is a slow down and decreasing of expenses percentage. Also, variation of numbers is more narrow for the US data.
