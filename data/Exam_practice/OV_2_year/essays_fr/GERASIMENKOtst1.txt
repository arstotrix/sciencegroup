The first chart shows the trend concerning the number of 3D digital screens between 2005 and 2011 and the second one shows the tendency of cinema releases in the period from 2005 to 2012.
The number of  3D screens  shows the S-curve of growth. The increase was relatively slow till 2009 and then the boost took place lasting till 2011, when the number of 3D screens reached approximately 35,000 and the growth subsided. As far as 3D cinema releases are concerned, the overall growth was still steady in 2012 but there is a difference between the number of live action films and animation. From 2005 to 2007 only animated films were released in 3D and the number of releases was quite low making around 3 films a year. In 2008 live action 3D films emerged and the number of them grew from 2 in 2008 to 47 in 2012. Compared to live action films, the increase in number of animated 3D films was not so drastic as only 26 of films of that category were released in 2012.
On the whole, the patterns of the increase in number of digital 3D screens and of 3D cinema releases are quite similar, which could reveal the tendencies in the 3D technology in general.
