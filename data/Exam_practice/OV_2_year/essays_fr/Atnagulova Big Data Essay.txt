Due to the increasing speed of informational growth nowadays people of all ages and interests have to deal with Big Data in lots of various ways. But it is still unclear whether Big Data is for our sake or not, whether people should open their minds to it or avoid it every possible way. 
Some people insist on extreme usefulness of enormous amounts of information. They say that world is changing no matter whether we like it or not, so we have to keep up with these changes, broaden our mental horizons to accept Big Data in our lives and take the best of it. 
On the contrary, other people say that overfilling our lives with Big Data and opening our minds to it constrain basic human rights. They keep referring to the Big Brother watching us theory and the possibility of machines insurrection due to its' possible evolve and creating its' own minds. 
But I still think that these ideas are quite too fantastic and thus almost impossible to happen, especially the idea of machine revolution. I think that real mind is something much bigger than just the set of numbers in a computer code. Computers simply cannot make something that they were not encoded to do by people. It also cannot make it's own decisions as it relies on the mathematical and physics data only. What computers will never be able to have is psychology.
Anyway Big Data has already become an integral part of our lives. The world disaster that would get us back to the Stone Age it is not likely to happen, so as willful ignorance is the loose of the control it is our high need to keep up with the growth of information and make an advantage of it.
