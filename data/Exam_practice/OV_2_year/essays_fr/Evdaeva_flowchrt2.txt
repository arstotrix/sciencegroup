The line chart below provides information about three London museums which were visited in June, July, August and September 2013. 

To begin with, we can notice that the graph is based on three famous museums of London - British Museum, Science Museum and Naturally History Museum. Most people (between 500000 and 750000) preferred visiting the British Museum during the summer months. On the contrast, Science Museum was the least popular one. The number of visitors was decreasing gradually from month to month (from 400 thousand in June to 300 thousand in August), but after that there can be seen a significant rise in the number of visitors in September to 450000 people. As for the Natural History Museum, we should note that this museum was popular with visitors in June (approximately 570 thousand people went there), but it began to receive fewer visitors by July-August. The number of people who visited it dropped to 380000. In September the Natural History museum was again in demand and about (around) 480 thousand people went there on an excursion.

All in all, we can conclude that the British Museum was the most popular with the visitors during the summer months. Also, the number of visitors for all the three museums fluctuated throughout June, July, August and September of the year 2013.
