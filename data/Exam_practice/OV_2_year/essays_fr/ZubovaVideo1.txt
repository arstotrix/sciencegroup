As all the things, crowdsourcing has its pros and cons. Collecting new words into the big and famous dictionary is expected to be very educational and enlightening. You can do new discoveries â€“ for you and for other people and also you can share your knowledge with the same stakeholders as you are. Crowdsourcing is considered to be interesting and exciting experience for all the linguists and lexicographers in particular.
But if the estimated new word is not famous, who could know its real meaning? Who can guarantee that it is not the curse or entrapment? In this way, crowdsourcing seems to be risky. It is a precarious situation, in which the developer has to take responsibility for their proposal. And also a lot of new words can be really meaningless. So I think it should be approached with caution.
