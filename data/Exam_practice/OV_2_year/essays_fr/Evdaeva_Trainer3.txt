The given graph demonstrates the percentage of income people spend on petrol in two different countries - the United States of America and the United Kingdom.

First of all, it can be seen that drivers with the lowest income from the USA spend more money on fuel (approximately 4-5% of their income) than British people of the same social group, who spend 0.5-2% of their income. Moreover, we should mention that the more money American people earn, the less money they spend on petrol. We can see the opposite situation in the United Kingdom, where the percentage of money spent on fuel increases if people earn a lot of money. 

It is important to mention that the percentage of money that is spent on fuel is equal for British and American people with above-average income (they spend 4% of their income). Furthermore, the richest people from the United Kingdom spend nearly the same percentage of income on petrol as the poorest American drivers (do?) - 4% of income.

All in all, the graph below shows that people from the United Kingdom and the United States have different attitude to expenses on fuel.
