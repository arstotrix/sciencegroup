The charts represent the situation which local wildlife has been in from 2000 to present. The first chart provides reasons for population changes, while the second one shows the change in population figures concerning various species.
As far as the main reasons are concerned, the prevailing one is habitat destruction, comprising 43 per cent. Nevertheless, other factors are significant as well, for instance, pollution, overexploitation and random factors, for example accidents, making up 21 per cent, 15 per cent and 12 per cent accordingly.
All the reasons mentioned in the first chart led to the changes shown in the second chart. The overall trend is downward but there are exceptions. Thus, there has been an increase in population of some mammals such as a bat and a fox. The rise constitutes 23 per cent for the former and 9 per cent for the latter. Moreover, the population of an otter, which is an aquatic mammal, has also risen by 9 per cent. The rest of the species introduced in the chart have decreased in number. The most drastic drop of 43 per cent can be observed concerning the population of bees. The population of another insect, a butterfly, has fallen by 42 per cent, which is also a tremendous number. Therefore, it is insects that have suffered most but freshwater fish has also been affected. 
In general, various reasons have had an impact on wildlife population changes, most of them, however, being the human interference. The result of the influence is the decreasing populations of most species.
