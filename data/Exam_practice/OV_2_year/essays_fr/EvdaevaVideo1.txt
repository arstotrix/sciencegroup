Erin McKean is the dictionary editor and leding lexicographer who wants to invent more and more words. To achieve her goal, she has created Wordnik, an online dictionary that evolves with language itself. Anyone can add new words and definitions, tag words with related meanings and find/learn new words.

 As I know, one more example of the crowdsourcing might be the creation of the Oxford English Dictionary. At that time the edition appealed to the public with a request to send variants of the terms with their potential contexts of use. As a result, over a period of 70 years the edition received more than 6 million letters from the public.

 I believe that it's really a good idea to give all people an opportunity to participate in the process of creation of the dictionaries, because day by day there are appearing new words,  some of which become so relevant and widely used that they undoubtedly should be written in the dictionary in order to allow all people learn them and keep them in mind. But it is also important to add in the dictionaries not all words, but only those which are of current importance and might be useful for people.

 I would like to complete my essay with truly amazing words of McKean: "A word without its source is like a cut flower. You know, it's pretty to look at it for a while, but then it dies. It dies too fast". I definitely agree with her statement which means that if someone decides to propose some new word, he/she should explain why this word might be interesting and useful; it is also important to add some contexts in which the word can be used. Otherwise, the word can be described as nonsensical one.
