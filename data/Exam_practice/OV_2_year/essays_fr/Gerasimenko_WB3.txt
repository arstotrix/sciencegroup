It is common knowledge that artistic talent is required to succeed in creating art. Nevertheless, Art classes at schools involve all children regardless of the extent of their talent, which is controversial. Some people consider it an integral part of education whereas others believe it is a waste of time.

From my point of view, all children should participate in Art classes they not only detect the most capable pupils but also lessen stress which pupils are under because of the amount of information they are expected to process nowadays. Art provides children with the opportunity to express their feelings and thoughts. Moreover, working with paints and pencils may be enjoyable for everyone in the class. 

Contrary to that, there is an opinion according to which pupils that are not talented should not waste their time at Art classes. It is stated that such children ought to concentrate on subjects that may presumably be more useful for their future life and career. Furthermore, constant failings in art may discourage children from studying in general and have a destructive influence on their self-confidence. Apart from that, it is Art classes where the distinction between capable students and outsiders is the most evident, so those who lack talent are said to slow down the educational process.

However, I strongly believe that Art classes are an important part of education. Apparently, some children do develop a talent providing they have encouragement and opportunity to practice.

On the whole, it is essential for all students to have the opportunity to attend Art classes and create pictures as it has a positive impact on their state of mind. In order to avoid children without inherent talent being discouraged, adequate teaching and individual approach are required.
