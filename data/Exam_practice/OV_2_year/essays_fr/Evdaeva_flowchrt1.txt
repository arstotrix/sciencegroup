The given diagram shows us that goods go through many stages, starting with the storage and ending with their dispatch for sale, before they are put up for sale. 

To begin with, it is important to note that raw materials and manufactured components are the initial components of the manufacturing process. 

At the first planning stage it is decided how and in what quantities the stored materials will be processed in order to create sufficient quantities of finished products. But we should remember that the production planning depends on the design stage which consists of the market research and testing of products. When we do this research, which is influenced by the product sales, we must remember about the advertising, which may help to increase the demand for goods. The product analysis, which is also a part of the design stage, shows us what products and in what quantities is profitable to produce. 

As for the testing stage, I suppose that this stage is important in order to reveal serious problems in the finished products. And if such problems are found, manufacturers/producers will be able to make some modifications/improvements in the product's design. 

All in all, we can see that consumer goods manufacturing is a complex process. The manufacturing stages involve the storage, assembly, inspection, packing to the sales methods whereas the research stages include market and product research, design and the advertising stage.
