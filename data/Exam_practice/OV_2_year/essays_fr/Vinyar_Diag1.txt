Dear Professor,
We have observed the illiteracy rates of different populations over the world and structuralized our data according to gender and geographical factors. As we have discovered, the rates of illiteracy can be divided into six groups by regions and societies: Developed countries, Latin America/Caribbean, East Asia/Oceania, Sub-Saharan Africa, Arab States and South Asia. Additionaly, in every region the measure of illiteracy rate is different between male and female.
Our data represents two parametres: illiteracy rate for each gender in the region and the difference between male and female illiteracy rate. The most lower rate of illiteracy was discovered in society of developed countries: about 1% for males and 2% for females. In general, the rate in Latin America region is higher: 10% for males and about 12% for females, but it also shows little difference between males and females. The situation changes with East Asia region, where the difference between two genders is distinctive^ 20% for females and 8% for males. Both Africa and Arab States show slightly common high results 31% for males and 48% for females in Africa and 29% for males and 52% of females for Arab States. Finally, the South Asia region is considered “the most illiteral” region: 34% for males and 56% for females.
As this data shows, in all observed regions the illiteracy rate for females is higher than for males. However, males and females differ in all the regions in variable ways, as well as some regions strongly differ too.
