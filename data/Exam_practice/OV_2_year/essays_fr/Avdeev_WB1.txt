The bar chart gives information about the places students lived over five decades.

At the beginning of the forty years period, the ratio of students living in a shared house and the ones living in a host family was the same – 35% each. Of the remaining 15% lived at home with their family and the other 15% stayed at students’ hall of residence. By the end of the forty years, the figures for those living in a shared house and for those living in a host family had seen significant changes. The former had doubled while the latter had fallen by 30%.

Meanwhile the figures for the ones staying at students’ hall of residence and the ones staying at home with their own family were rather fluctuant. The former reached its highest point at 20% in 1970s and 1990s and then eventually dropped to 12% in 2000s, whereas the latter saw a downward trend until it hit its lowest point resulting in 5% in 1980s which stayed the same in 1990s and then at the end of forty years it increased by 8% ending up the same as the former.

Overall, it’s clearly seen that young people prefer more independent type of accommodation nowadays, which is well showed by the figures from the chart.
