The diagram represents the stages of headland erosion. As we can see the erosion begins in the weak areas where water affects the rock and first holes appear. Some time later small holes turn into a bigger ones, then into a small cave witch expands and finally an arch appears. Further, due to the combined influence of water, gravity and wind small rocks continue to separate from arch's top and walls, it expands even more and become higher and higher. A piece of land connecting a stack with the surface becomes thinner and finally vanishes. Then separated stack, which is more susceptible to the natural effects, destroys little by little until there is only a small stump left and in the end it escapes completely. By this time new piece of headland starts to retreat. So we can distinguish five different stages in the erosion of headland: hole, cave, arch, stack and stump.
