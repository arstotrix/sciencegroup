The two charts below give information about the number of global digital 3D screens and 3D cinema releases during the period from 2005 to 2012.
According to the first (line) graph the overall number of 3D screens increased gradually from 0 in 2005 to approximately 3000 in 2008 and achieved the highest position by 2011 (35000). 
As we can see on the second chart, 3D live action films were introduced later, but they were more popular with people than the animation ones. There was released roughly the equal amount of animation films from 2005 to 2007 (approximately 5), but after that this number had increased to 25 by 2012. As for the live action films, people began to release them in 2008 and the number of such films was increasing significantly from year to year (from 6 to 70). 
The general overview is that from 2008 there were introduced more digital 3D screens as well as live action films. It means that from this year more and more people started to watch such films and that is why the number of digital screens also increased.
