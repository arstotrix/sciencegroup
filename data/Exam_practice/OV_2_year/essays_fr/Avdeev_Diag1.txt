Today’s young people experience more and more pressure in studying. So, one of the ways to reduce the pressure would probably be removing non-academic subjects. But would it be really that helpful?

I personally think that this idea may not be that bad but of course to some extent. First of all, there are a lot of students who actually enjoy those subjects. Some of them use PE or cooking as a way to relief the stress or distract themselves from constant studying. Moreover, there are people who see those non-academic subjects as their future. For example some students want to become a chef so attending cookery classes would be a great opportunity to learn something. To sum up, I think those kinds of subjects should be left optional, so if you want to attend then – go for it but if you do not, you can focuse of something else instead.

However, many people think that non-academic subjects (e.g. PE or art) help young people to find themselves and giving them the responsibility to choose what to learn and what not at such a young age is not a good idea. So, it is better to introduce them to those subjects, show them what they really are.

Although, it might be a good point. I still think that putting young people under so much pressure (combining academic and non-academic subjects) is way too much. So, if some parents want to introduce their children to some non-academic subjects that can always sign them for local sport, cookery etc. classes.

To sum up, I think education should be more flexible in general, so students at school could always choose what they want to learn and what they are not interested in at all.
