The chart represents the distribution of the amount of exercise among employees of two departments. The table shows the absenteeism of employees for different number of days per year.
The chart reveals that most employees in both departments take between 5 and 10 hours of exercise per week making 50 per cent in Birmingham and approximately 47 per cent in London, so the difference in the percentage is slight. However, the rate of workers exercising less than 5 hours is more than two times as high in London as in Birmingham. The former is 35 per cent and the latter is only 15 per cent. Moreover, fewer people in London department exercise for more than 10 hours per week than in Birmingham department. All these observations provide the opportunity to conclude that the employees of London department exercise less in general.
As far as absenteeism through illness is concerned, approximately equal number of people, which is around 379, showed no absenteeism and had to be absent due to health problems between 1 and 5 days a year in Birmingham whereas the gap between those categories in London is tremendous, where 158 people did not miss workdays because of illness while between 1 and 5 days a year were missed by 594 people, which is almost four times as many. The part of employees having missed more than 5 days a year is approximately equal in both departments making a quarter of the total number of the people fallen under study.
On the whole, Birmingham department tends to have healthier employees than that of London which can be observed both in the higher rates of employees taking more than 5 hours of exercise per week and in a lower number of employees absent from work due to health issues.
