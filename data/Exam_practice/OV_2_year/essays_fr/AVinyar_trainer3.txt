The graph represents information about the amount of money people spend on petrol in the USA and the United Kingdom.
In order to represent information, people are divided in groups depending on their income: the poorest, middle income and the richest. In the United Kingdom it is true that the poorer people are the lower percentage of their income they tend to spend on petrol, while in the USA the situation is quite different. The poorest UK people spend approximately 0,5 percent of their income on petrol, and the amount of earnings spent grows up to nearly four percent  for upper middle class, for which it is same as the American one. 
At the same time, the USA poor people spent about five percent of their income on petrol, and, unlike UK, the amount of money they spent decreases with increasing of people’s wealth to 4 percent. It should be noted, that the poorest group of poor people spends less on petrol – nearly 4 percent. Two countries have one thing in common – for the richest people the percentage of income spent on petrol tends to decrease: for the USA from 4 percent to 2,5 and for the UK it decreases slightly slower – from 4 to 3,25.
