In 1960s 15%  of students living in students hall residence or at home with their own families each has decreased to 5% in 2000s. However fell in the percentage of students living in hall residence had been increasing untill 1970s then  fell to the original rate in 1980s, increased again in 1990s and finally fell by 2000s while the percentage of students living with their families had been falling steadily untill 1980s and increased rapidly by the last observed decade.
