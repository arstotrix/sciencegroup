This chart represents the results of the literacy rate research in different parts of the world. According to the chart both men and women in Developed Countries have the lowest rate of illiteracy while in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia more  than 30% of the researched men appeared to illiteral. Also more than half of the women in Arab States and South Asia have been found out to be illiteral. Generally women in all the researched areas are less literal than men in the same areas according to the research. All in all the results that had been had can be explained the following way: Developed Countries have achieved more significant results in all the areas of people's lives so education system is more productive there and people need to be highly educated to keep up with the pace of life there. As the country is less developed comparing to all the other countries people there are less educated and the gap between men and women is broader because these societies are more traditional and women have different life role than in the Developed Countries.
