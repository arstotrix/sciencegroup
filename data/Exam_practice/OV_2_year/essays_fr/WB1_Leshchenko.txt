  At the beginning of the forty-year period, the percentage change in places where students lived demonstrates the main trends.
  We can see that in the 1960s most students lived in a shared house or flat with other students or were paying guests with a host family. –ê small number of students lived in a student hall of residence or stayed at home with own family. Since 2000s, however, the figure has changed significantly. The amount of students who lived in a shared housing increased from 35 to 75 per cent, while those students who lived with a host family had fallen to just 5 per cent. Amounts for students living with own family or in a dormitory changed, but it is a minor change.
  A more detailed look at the graph reveals that overall changes were not always steady. The number of students living in a shared house has increased significantly compared to other indicators.
  Obviously, the most popular type of accommodation is a room in a shared house as this level had exceeded all others.
