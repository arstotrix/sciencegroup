The graph represents the dynamics of accommodation choice among the students in the period of five decades from the 1960s till the 2000s. In the 1960s percentage of students sharing a house or a flat with others formed 35 per cent and was equal to the rate of those who lived as a paying guest with the host family whereas in the 2000s the former variant became twice as widespread chosen by 70 per cent of students and the latter has lost its popularity with only 5 per cent of young people having preferred it. On the whole, number of students living in a shared house or a flat showed a continuous and steady increase. On the contrary, the rate of variant of being a paying guest gradually subsided.

As far as other accommodation opportunities are concerned, percentage of young people living in a studentsâ€™ hall of residence was fluctuating between 13 and 20 per cent throughout the five decades. Fewer and fewer students were choosing to live with their families from the 1960s to the 1990s with the minimum of 5 per cent but the tendency changed in the 2000s, when 15 per cent of young people lived at home.

In general, various types of accommodation were popular in the 1960s but a clear tendency to the prevalence of the single variant of sharing a house or a flat with other students is observed throughout the decades.
