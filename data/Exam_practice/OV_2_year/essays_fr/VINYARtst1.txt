The two schemas represent information about increasing of the number of digital 3d screens and 3d cinema releases between 2005 and 2012. It can be assumed that in general the dynamics of changing of both numbers are quite similar and represent the dependence between them.
During the period of time between 2005 and 2007 the number of releases of digital 3d screens and 3d movie releases were extremely low (about 1.000 and 1 respectively). Moreover, all the 3d films in the cinema were animations. Things began to change in 2008 when the life action films appeared. The number of both 3d digital screens and 3d cinema films increased about twice. With each following year we can observe the accelerating growth rate of both numbers and the percentage of live action films in number of cinema releases, too. In 2009 it was about 13 cinema releases and about 9.000 of 3d screens, in 2010 it was more than thirty 3d film releases (about 10 of them were live action) and more than 20.000 digital screens. For number of digital 3d screens we have information about 2012, but by the chart of 3d cinema releases, where in 2012 we can observe an enormous number of films released (more than 70), we can predict that the number of 3d screens will rise too.
