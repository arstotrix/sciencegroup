The graph shows us how much people of different income level spend on petrol in United Kingdom and United States.
It is significant that the middle poorest people in America tend to spend the greatest amount of money, more than 5%, on petrol compared to all other classes in both countries. But the wealthier people in America are the less money they waste on fuel. On the contrary, in the United Kingdom the tendency is that the sums spent on fuel rise with the increase of peoplesâ€™ prosperity, so the poorest social class spent much less than 1% of their income on petrol then the middle one which spends about 3-4% and it is still less than the richest do. But there is a slight change in the British richest class witch results in the fact that the wealthiest part of British population tend to spend less money than the poorer one of the richest class. This way the richest rich people in both countries aim to spend less than 4% on petrol.
However, people in both countries on the break of middle and richest classes spend nearly the same sums on petrol, and people from the first half of richest class waste an equal amount of money on petrol.
