On the map we can see two possible sites for new school and each of them has its own advantages and disadvantages. The first site is in the quiet countryside so the sounds of town wont disturb children from lessons, the air there is also rather clean and there is no town bustle so the physical education lessons can be held outdoors. On the other hand, second site which is in town centre would be located more comfortably as it would take almost the same time to get to school whichever part of the town children live in. But there is no traffic zone on the second site so parents wont be able to give their children a lift to school by car. But the absence of traffic zone in town centre also provides enough safe space for children to study and walk after lessons. However, as many children from nearby towns Sturry and Chartham go to school in Canterbury first site would be more suitable because it seems to be almost at the distance from both of the towns and it is close to the main road.
