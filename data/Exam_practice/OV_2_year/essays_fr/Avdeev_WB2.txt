The given chart illustrates information on the amount of time employees from two departments of a major company spent on exercise in the year of 2012. 

It can be clearly seen that the employees form the Birmingham department got more exercise then those from London. Although, the percentage of people who spent on exercise between 5 and 10 hours per week is almost the same (50% for Birmingham and about 47% for London), about 35% of the employee from the London department got less then 5 hours of exercise per week whereas in Birmingham the staff who spent that amount of time on exercise is only 15%.

The table shows the number of days the employees werenâ€™t present at work due to illness in the year of 2012. Overall, the number of people who were absent from their work in London is higher. For instance, in the Birmingham department there were 380 people per 1000 employees who did not take any days off due to being ill while in London there are only 158 employees who did not do that.

To summaries, the staff from the Birmingham department got more exercise then those form London, which might be the reason why they had to take less days off due to being ill.
