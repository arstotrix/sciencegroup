Nowadays a lot of things in our future depend on our academic success, on our studies at school and university. And many people think that non-academic subjects don’t give us opportunity to wholly concentrate on academic subjects and they should be removed from the school syllabus. I totally disagree with this statement, but let us see the pros and cons of this method.
On the one hand, it is good when your brain always ‘on work’ and fully concentrates on studying and getting new knowledge and information, so you can know more than you will do some extra things.
On the other hand, constantly working mental children will tire faster and may have problems with health like headache or problems with eyes. It is helpful for our brains to have a break. And all of us know that physical education and physical activities are good and very useful for health and subjects like sport classes will never be extra at school. Of course, subjects like cookery, art or music can help children to have relax and to discover new talents, it can be important for girls, at first.
To sum up, I want to say about my own life experience. In my maths school academic subjects were always alternated with non-academic like volleyball, needlework, chess and cookery. And I can say that these subjects helped to get new information after break ‘with new forces’. So I believe that people who think that non-academic subjects don’t give opportunity to concentrate on learning are not right.
