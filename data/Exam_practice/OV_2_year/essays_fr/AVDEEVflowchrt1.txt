There are a lot of stages that consumer goods go through before they eventually go on sale. 

The manufacturing process starts with obtaining raw materials and manufactured components. When that is done, they are stored until the production planning stage is over. After that, assembly finally starts and it is followed by multiple tests to make sure that the quality of the products lives up to consumersâ€™ expectations. As soon as it is over, the assembled goods are packaged, dispatched and sent for sale. 

The research department carries out product research to determine the design of the product. However, the design is also influenced be testing and market research. Sometimes adjustments have to be made after the testing stage. Market research has the role of deciding the design of the product as well and it usually depends on sales. More over, market research helps to develop an advertising campaign.

In summary, consumer good manufacturing is an extremely complicated process that includes both manufacturing and research methods.
