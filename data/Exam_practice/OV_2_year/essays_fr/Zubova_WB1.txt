The chart below gives the information about the percentage change in place where students lived over five decades from 1960s to 2000s.
As we can see, the main trend is that all the time the majority of students lived in a room in shared house or flat with other students. From 1970s to 1980s there was a surge in numbers of students living in a shared house from 40 to 60 per cent, and then this number gradually increased to 70 per cent. 
On the contrary, in 1960s there was a big amount of students living in a host family, but by 2000s this percentage decreased to only 5 per cent.
It is obvious that the amount of students living in studentsâ€™ hall or residence was always on about the same level  -- 15-20 per cent.
By the way, the number of students who lived at home with their own family was not always very big. From 1960s it gradually decreased to 5 per cent, but in 2000s students living at home were about two times more than in 1990s.
