The graph represents the percentage of income people of different social class spend on petrol in the United States of America and the United Kingdom.
As far as the USA is concerned, the decrease in the proportion between expenses on petrol and income depending on social class is observed. Thus, the poorest Americans tend to spend up to more than 5 per cent of their income on petrol whereas the percentage of expenses on petrol drops from 4 to 2.5 per cent with the increasing income of rich people.
The trend in the UK is the opposite. The higher the social class is, the bigger the percentage of income is spent on petrol. Petrol comprises only 0.5 per cent of income obtained by the poorest British, while people from the highest social class spend from 3.5 to 4 per cent of their income on petrol.
The point where percentage in two countries matches concerns people with the income slightly higher than that accepted middle. In both countries people of this class spend approximately 4 per cent of their income on petrol.
On the whole, the overall tendencies are significantly different in two countries but the most remarkable difference lies in the class of poorest people whereas the richest people behave similarly in the UK and in the USA.
