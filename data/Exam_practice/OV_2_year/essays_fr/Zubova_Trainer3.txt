The given graph shows us the information about the correlation between income of people from USA and the United Kingdom and the amount of money they spend on petrol. It is significant that the poorest people in the United Kingdom almost do not spend too much money on petrol â€“ this indicator tends in average to 2 per cent of income. But their richest part of population used to spend almost 4 per cent of income on fuel.
On the contrary, the poorest people of the United States spend more money on fuel, but this indicator of richest group tends only to 2 per cent. 
We can see that the middle-income groups of both countries tend to spend approximately the same part of their income on petrol. 
To sum up, the indicators of outlay on fuel in middle-income and richest classes of the USA and the UK go pretty equally.
But it is very intriguing figure that there is a big difference in numbers for poorest segments of population.
