In our developing world we are always faced with Big Data. It is in shop signs, advertisement on billboards, on the radio or in newspapers and magazines. All what we read in books, all what we see on TV or in Internet – that is Big Data. Data surround us and we don’t know what they will be for us in the next moment – joyful or sad, good or not so.
And of course, we don’t know how we will react on this data.

Recently my boyfriend and I have watched the French-Belgian film ‘Le Tout Nouveau Testament’. This is a story about girl whose father was God. Little Ea had decided to get back at her father and snuck into his home-office. She did an unimaginable thing – she sent to all people of the world their date of death. So people were faced with Big Data! And some of them were unbearable afraid, they realized that how much they hadn’t yet done. Does anyone want to know such type of data?

It depends on person how to treat Big Data. It depends on person how to interpret Big Data. Undoubtedly, Big Data is often very useful and handy. It helps us every day and on every step. As Kenneth Kukier said in his talk, Big Data will help us to grow, to get promoted. For the most part, Big Data will improve our lives. But do not forget that some data may be dangerous or false. It is our need to be attentive and careful with Big Data.
