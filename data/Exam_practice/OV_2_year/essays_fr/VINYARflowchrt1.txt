This diagram shows the stages of process of manufacturing and adjustment of consumer goods. In the process of production, we should take into account two main properties: the transition between one fabrication stage to another and the flow of information, which was got on a particular stage, back to previous stages. The information feedback is undoubtedly necessary, because it can enable adjustment of manufacturing of the product. 
The manufacturing begins with raw materials and manufactured components stored in a warehouse. In this stage the design of a product have to be determined. Considering design, materials and components, the production planning begins. Information from this stage flows back to the storage stage to change the amount of supplies.  Then the product needs to be assembled, inspected and tested. The information from these tests serves as a feedback to the design stage. 
After this, the product proceeds to steps of packaging, dispatch and sale. The information from the sales of the product needs to be given to the stages of production planning and to market researches.  By the analysis on the research stage, new design, packaging and advertising strategies and technologies can be developed.
