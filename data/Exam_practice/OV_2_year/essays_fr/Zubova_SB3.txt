The given charts provide the information about the percentage of eaten food by two different groups of students and the table below illustrates the relation between the diets and students’ health.
As we can see, students from the group A eat more healthy products – they eat 20 percent less food with a high fat content than students from the group B.  And what is natural that in the group B there are twice as many students with overweight as in the group A.  
More than a third of students in both groups eat cereals. 
Also, there are the same rates of eaten fish in both groups but it’s really small percentage – only 5 percent of the diet plan. 
What is more, the students from the group A eat much more fruits and vegetables compare to students from the group B – 30 percent to 10 percent respectively. 
Moreover, students who eat more healthy food have fewer illnesses in the past year and their rate of attendance at classes is higher than students’ with another diet (90 percent compare to 75). 
All in all, the given data helps us to reach a conclusion that diet may have an impact on the health level and on students’ absenteeism and academic achievement.
