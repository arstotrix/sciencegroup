Nowadays, many people think that art subjects are very useless and should be removed from the school syllabus. Every point of view has their pros and cons but, personally, I don’t fully agree with this mention. There are a lot of people who will disagree with me because they believe that non-academic subjects is just a waste of time and it only bothers children to wholly concentrate on main subjects.

Of course, you have to do your best and study well at school and university for gaining success in future. And the more you work on a certain subject, the more you know and can.
But all need the rest and little refreshment. At school it can be art classes like painting and drawing. And it is not so pointless making children who lack artistic talent to do it. 

At first, art classes can help children to discover new talents and skills. Even if the child doesn’t have truly outstanding skills at art, these classes might be very educational and entertaining for him.  And who knows how it might affect his future because art helps to create our personality, our way of thinking.  While you are a child, you have to learn all the subjects from the school syllabus to become versatile man and all of those subjects may be useful in your future profession.

All in all, the art classes may help to expand children’ horizons and to open up. Art can’t bring negative effects and emotions. So, people who believe that children should concentrate only on subjects for which they may have more aptitude are not right.
