Today education plays great role in peopleâ€™s lives. It helps to get a good job, to understand the world, to become intelligent and so on. That is why many people go to universities, get a degree or even become scientists. However, every person starts their education in school where they take physical education or cookery aside from main academic subjects. Some people believe that these subjects are unnecessary.
In my opinion, these subjects are not as important as academic ones but are still need because it is common knowledge that active rest is more beneficial than passive one and these subjects give pupils opportunity to have a break from difficult brainwork. Moreover, physical education helps to stay healthy.
However, some people believe that non-academic subjects are unnecessary and pupils should be concentrated only on academic subjects or can do these activities like cooking and sport on their own. Nevertheless, I think that these subjects teach pupils different types of activities and help to find a hobby, which may be important because they help to overcome stress or just relax. During the study, it is very important.
In conclusion, I would like to say that non-academic subjects are still necessary in school but they should not take too much time or there are should not be too much homework. Still, the main purpose is to give pupils academic education and non-academic subjects should not interfere.
