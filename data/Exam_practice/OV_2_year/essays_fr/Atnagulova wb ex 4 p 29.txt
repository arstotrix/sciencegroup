We all had Art classes at school and we all had different attitudes to it. Some students even insist on Art classes to be canceled because not everybody has any artistic talent.
As for me, I think that every student should attend Art classes because arts are what teaches us to see the world in a different way. Arts help us improve our imagination, become more patient, it makes us think broader.
On the other hand, they say that very few students have any artistic talent so the rest of the students are fated to keep getting bad grades and have no chance of graduating from school with good diploma. It is unfair to make them waste time on subject they are not and will never be good at while they could be doing something more useful.
I am totally agree that you cannot draw good if you have no talent to it but also I think there is a way out. For example, schools can suggest students a choice among several types of art so you will have a chance to choose something you can do better. Also, I think that art teachers should be less strict grading students in ordinary schools because arts in not an area of main specialty for such students.
To sum up, I would like to point that no matter whether student is good at arts or not getting to know it better can be useful anyway. Someone who had studied arts even very little will always be a clever interlocutor, an interesting person with tenacious mind. You will never suffer from knowing even a bit of arts.
