As far as I am concerned, the most interesting fact is that the percentage of students who preferred to stay in a shared house or flat with other students increased gradually from 35% in the 1960s to 70% in the 2000s.

It can be also noticed that from year to year staying with a host family was becoming more and more unpopular and the number of students who tended to choose this type of accommodation decreased from 35% in the 1960s to 5% in the 2000s.

I should also add that the number of students who lived with their own family had the least percentage over three decades, except the 1960s and the 2000s when the percentage of teenagers who lived in the students’ hall of residence and the percentage of those who chose living with their parents was equal.

All in all, we can see that the most preferable choice of accommodation for students over the whole period was considered to be a room in a shared house or flat with other students. As for the students` hostel, the number of people who chose this type of accommodation fluctuated in different decades and in the1960s it had its highest percentage – 35%.
