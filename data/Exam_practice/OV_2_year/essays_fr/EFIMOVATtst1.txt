The chart and graph show changes in amount of 3D screens between 2005 and 2011 and the number of 3D films between 2005 and 2012. It is clearly seen that the number of both releases and screens has grown very rapidly. Also it is obvious that amount of screens is closely connected with number of films.

Though in 2005 there were almost no 3D films (the number of released movies from 2005 to 2008 almost remains the same) and until 2008 they were only animated ones. In 2009 the amount of films and releases both began to increase intensively and in 2011 40 000 screens and 50 films were released. So the biggest rise was between 2008-2012 years. Also it may be noticed that amount of action films had increased relatively high. For example in 2009 there were about 5 action 3D films and in 2012 there were about 50 ones.  So they overcome 3D animated films in popularity.
