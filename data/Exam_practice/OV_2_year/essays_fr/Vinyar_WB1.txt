This graph represents the changes in accommodation choice preferences of students from the 1960s to the 2000s. There are three types of accommodation observed: “room in a shared flat with other student”, “student’s hall of residence”, “guest with a host family” and “at home with student’s own family. 
In the 1960s staying at student’s hall of residence or at home with family showed the same equal percentage – 15 percent. The rate of student’s living in the hall of residence shows quite no dynamics of change: the values are between 20 and 12 percent for all five decades. The number of students staying and home tends to decrease with 15 percent in 1960s and 5 percent in 1990s, but has actually increased in 2000s up to 12 percent, which is also a percentage of “hall of residence” students this decade.
In the 1960s percentage of students sharing a flat was equal to the percentage of students living with a host family (35% each). Every decade the number of “flat sharing” students increased for 5 percent and 20 percent from 1970s to 1980. It has formed a completely different situation in 2000s: 70 percent of students share house or a flat with each other and only 5 percent continues to live with a guest family.
In general, students tend to become more and more independent with their accommodation choice. More and more of them share a flat with each other, while number of students living with parents or other families is decreasing.
