Some centuries ago, when the science was not developed, many people got their food only by hunting and planting. It was vitally essential for men to be physically strong and for women to be good housekeepers. Nowadays the situation has changed, education is becoming more and more important , that is why some people insist on removing  non-academic subjects from school programme.
As far as I am concerned, children (especially in the primary school) should develop harmonically. There is an opinion nowadays that academical success is the most important for young people. But who said that this opinion is right? What if only on PE, cooking or music classes the child will understand that he wants to be a sportsman, a chef in the restaurant or a musician? If these subjects will be removed, practically we can lose some future medals on the Olympic Games, some world-famous restaurants that could be opened and some new Mozarts. 
Moreover, it is no doubt that every person needs to be healthy. The easiest way to achieve it is to do sport regularly. But if a child wonâ€™t get used to sport exercises at young age on PE, he probably will never get used to it. And speaking about cooking: everyone should be able to cook basic simple meals, especially girls. Their mothers sometimes are too busy to teach them, that is why cooking lessons at school are an ideal solution.
To sum up I would like to say that it is stupid to deny the majority of academic subjects nowadays. But every person should also study non-academic ones, at least on basic level. That is why physical education, cooking, music, etc. cannot be removed from school programme.
