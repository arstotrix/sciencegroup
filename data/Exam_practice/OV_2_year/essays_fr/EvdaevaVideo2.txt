I agree with the words of the famous data editor Kenneth Cukier who said in his lecture that big data gives us an opportunity to perceive old information in a new way, to see more of the same thing we were looking at.

 I assume that more data allows us to see better. Imagine, that you are a marketing specialist, for example, and you want to collect and analyze huge amounts of data about what products people buy most often in the supermarkets, in what quantities, and what products are, on the contrary, not in demand. On the basis of the collected information you can build the marketing strategies, anticipate (predict) defecit and surplus of the definite products, define what exactly make customers buy some and ignore other products, how to attract people's attention to unpopular products and so on. Big data is an extremely important tool by which society is going to advance if we use it effectively. We should not forget that there also may appear dark sides to big data as well. Big data is believed to transform how we live, how we think and work, it can even steals our job if we do not use it carefully.

 All in all, I suppose that big data, analysis of which allows researchers, analysts and business users to make better and faster decisions using data that was previously inaccessible, is useful for all people. But as Susan Etlinger, an in industry analyst said in her speech: "We are not passive consumers of data. We shape the role it plays in our lives and the way we make meaning from it, but to do that, we have to pay as much attention to how we thing as how we code", in order to avoid the problems which big data may cause if we use it ineffectively and incautiously.
