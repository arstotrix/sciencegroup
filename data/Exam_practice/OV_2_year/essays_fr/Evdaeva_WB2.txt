The charts below demonstrate food preferences of students of two different groups and give information about their general health. 
To begin with, I would like to note that, according to the pie charts, teenagers from the group A in comparison with the group B lead a healthier lifestyle. Their diet consists of 22% of vegetables and 8% of fruit, while students from the B group consume only 5% of both fruit and vegetables. The pie charts also show that there are some similarities in the amount of products that teenagers tend to eat. For instance, both groups eat an equal amount of fish (5%) and cereals (35%). Nevertheless, the level of food with a high fat content eaten by the group B (50%) is significantly higher than in the group A (30%). 
A table, which provides information about the general health of students, shows that there are twice as many overweight teenagers in the group B (20%) as in the group A. Moreover, students from the second group are more than twice as likely to be ill (to be in poor health) as students from the first group (12% versus 5%). As a result, 25% of students from the B group miss classes, while attendance at classes of the first group is high - 90%. 
All in all, it can be seen that if teenagers lead unhealthy lifestyle, they can have not only health problems but also problems with studies.
