The chart below shows us the information about estimated world literacy for the year 2020. The chart includes 6 columns with regions and each column is rated in two parts by gender.
As we can see, the main trend is that men all over the world are more competent than women.
In developed countries people set the bar high and there are less than 10 per cent of illiteracy. But on the contrary, in South Asia there is more than a half of population is not very competent. In the Latin America and Caribbean region it is the same level of illiteracy for men and women and it is not so high (about 10 per cent).
For Sub-Saharan Africa and Arab States there are approximately the same numbers of illiterate people: about one third of men and fifty per cent of women.
As for East Asia/Oceania, there is extraordinary fact that there are illiterate women as twice as more than illiterate men. But all these numbers are estimated and it can change for the year 2020.
