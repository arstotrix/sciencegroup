Both charts represent the proportion of the types of food students used to eat. The table below the charts gives us some information that could have been connected with students' diets.
As we can see, the parts that fish played in general ratio are the same in both groups, 3%, as well as the parts played by cereals, 35%. In group A the quota of fruits is 3% more than in group B but still fruits were not very popular with students. 22% of vegetables in general proportion is just a bit less than the 30% of fat food consumed by students in first group while in second one highly fatty food stands at the half of general consumption and vegetables had only 5% among other products.
Thus we can see that the part of overweight students in group B was twice as more than in group A. Ratio of ill students in first group also appeared to be more than twice as less than in second one and they had an extremely high rate of attendance rather than students from group B.
