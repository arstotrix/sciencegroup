The chart represents the estimated distribution of illiteracy rate at 2020 depending on region and gender. On the whole, there is a clear tendency for more women being illiterate. The difference is slight in developed countries and Latin America and Caribbean compared to Arab States where the gap is tremendous. Moreover, in all parts of the world more than a half of men are literate whereas in Arab State the number of women exceeds fifty per cent.

As far as correlation between illiteracy and the region is concerned, a gap between developed countries, Latin America and Caribbean and East Asia and Oceania on the one hand and Sub-Saharan Africa, Arab States and South Asia on the other hand is observed. The rate of illiterate population in the latter regions is higher. In general, the population is the most literate in developed countries and the most illiterate in South Asia.

The observed tendencies in the distribution of illiteracy rates can be explained by differences in educational opportunities depending on a region and gender inequality prevailing in developing countries.
