The given chart and graph illustrate information about 3D cinema screens and film releases.
To begin with, we can see that number of global digital 3D screens had a sharp increase in 3 years from 2008 until 2011. For many years before 2009 this indicator had been at the level of less than 5000 of screens. But in 2011 this index reached approximately 40000 screens.
Moreover, according to the right chart, the rate of live action in global 3D cinema releases was on the 0 level until the year of 2008. In 2008 the rates of live action and animation were the same and their total amount was only 5. In the next years it really increased and in 2012 the total amount of 3D cinema releases reached more than 70, what is twice as many than in 2010. And all in all, this information can help us make a proposal that nowadays these numbers even more and increase every year.
