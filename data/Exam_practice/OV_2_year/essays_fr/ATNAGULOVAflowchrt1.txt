The diagram represents the process of manufacturing consumer goods. First of all raw materials and manufactured components are being delivered to the storage. At the same time the product research takes place and when the research is finished the design of the manufactured product begins. When the final design of the goods is confirmed the production planning stage begins which sends its feedback to the storage and then leads to the assembly of the future product.
