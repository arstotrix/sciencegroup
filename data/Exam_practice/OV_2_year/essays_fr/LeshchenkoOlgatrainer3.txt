The graph illustrates what proportion of people spend on petrol in the USA and the United Kingdom. It shows three sections: the poorest, middle-income and the richest.
It can be clearly seen from the graph is that the biggest difference is beetween the poorest sections: American low-class people spend about 5 per cent of their income, while English people spend only from 0.5 to 2.5 per cent. However, the proportion of fuel decreases steadly in the middle-income section (20%) in the USA, while United Kingdom doubles significantly and fabuolsly (30%). It gives information that the cars in the USA are not much used by middle-income people, and in the UK it is on the contrary. 
Overall, the percentage of income spent on petrol  generally gets higher in the UK than in the USA.
