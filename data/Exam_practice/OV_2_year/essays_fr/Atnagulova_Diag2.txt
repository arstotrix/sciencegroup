Life all over the world keeps changing constantly. Pace of life becomes faster and faster and there is a high need for people to use their time rationally from the very young age. Teachers and students think of optimisation of educational system and when children and their parents find out child's strongest side they want to place focus on it and waste as few time on other subjects as possible. That is why some disciplines become unpopular and people insist on them to be canceled.
As for me I am partly agree with such a notion because the less time you spend on improving your best skills the less competitive you become comparing to other people that also want to преуспеть in your area. It is also much easier to concentrate on one or two subjects that you like most than to spend time trying to do your best in 15 different areas you have problems concentrating on.
On the other hand they say that first of all children should become people so they need to be aware of basic knowledge every person should know such as las, human rights, physics laws, sociology, literature, they need to know how to speak correctly, children should be healthy, strong and should know how to survive in society because it is what makes them people. And I cannot deny the importance of these basics as they are justified to be in such a focus. 
All in all I think that study hours spent on non-academic subjects should be maximally shortened to help children improve the skills they want. But in the same time parents should explain their children the importance of such subjects and help children improve them outside the school. For example, mothers can reach their daughters housekeeping, can do sports together with their children and so on. Because nobody can live without the basics.
