The series of diagrams shows coastal formation of sedimentary rocks. The process begins with the rainfall when cracks in the mountains are filled with rainwater. The water in the cracks freezes causing the cracks to expand due to the increase in the volume of ice compared to that of water. Pieces of rock are eventually dislodged and fall into the mountain river. They move down carried by the current till they reach the ocean where they can settle down. The heavier the rock is, the closer to the coast and the bottom of the sea it would settle. Thus, layers on the sea bed are formed. Through time, the elements are cemented owing to chemicals in the seawater. Finally, the sedimentary rock is formed.
Thus, this process shows how powerful water can be. It is perfectly capable of destroying rocks even in the form of the rainfall and carrying their fragments over long distances.
