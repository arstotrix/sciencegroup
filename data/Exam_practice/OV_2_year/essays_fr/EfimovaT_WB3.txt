Art is important part of our lives. Especially visual art. We all enjoy it in different way. Some people create paintings; some design things with help of technologies and others do not have desire or ability to create something and they just like to observe pieces of art. However, all children learn painting and drawing in Art classes in school in the same way. So should pupils, who do not have ability to draw and paint well, be removed from Art classes? In my view, they should not be. 

For a start, the separation of children with ability to draw from others cannot be fair. Obviously, every child has its own manner and particularities in creation and if this manner differs from the pattern, that teacher gives, it doesnâ€™t mean that child is untalented. It means that his way of expressing himself is individual. However often teacher does not often explain such things and children get upset because their paintings do not look similar to the pattern though often it is not so necessary. 

Controversially, some people think that pupils with a lack of talent may slow and irritate talented children. Though I suppose that in every subject there are pupils who are doing better or worse than others. Undoubtedly, no one will remove a pupil from math if he has some problems with it. For those who has a talent to a particular area there are often created extra classes or even schools with particular specialization. 

In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that art is a reflection of the world around us and our personal feelings. It is better to teach children to express themselves instead of telling them who has a talent and who has not.
