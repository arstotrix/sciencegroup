On the given graph we can see how much people in the United Stated and the United Kingdom spend on petrol. The information about the percent of income spend on petrol is given by the vertical axis, and the information about financial class is given by the horizontal axis. Two lines present graphs for USA and UK. The biggest diversity of two lines could be seen in poorest financial class. In the UK, the poorest citizens spend the least percent of their income on petrol, while in USA people with the least income spend the largest percentage of it on petrol. This basically means that the amount of money spends on petrol in the USA is approximately constant for people with different incomes. In general, part of graph, which presents USA, gradually goes down, which confirms the hypothesis given above. As for the UK graph, it on the contrary gradually goes up, which basically means, that the amount of petrol people use in this country is not a constant, but depends on the income.
To sum up, the graph shows, that the attitude to spend on petrol is rather different in the United States of America and in the United Kingdom.
