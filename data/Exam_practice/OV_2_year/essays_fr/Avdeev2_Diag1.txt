I’d like to present you the results of the research that was carried out to estimate illiteracy in different parts of the world. For each region there is one number for each gender (male and female). So, it was found that the most developed countries are the most literate – 1% and 2% of illiterate population. They are followed by Latin America/Caribbean where the illiteracy rated are by about 9% more so it is 10% of male population and 12% of female. After that goes east Asia where the rates are 8% and 20%. So as you can see there is a big difference between man and woman is that region. The same tendency continues in other regions where male population tends to be more illiterate, for example Sub-Saharan Africa where the rated are 31% and 48%. The next 2 regions are pretty close to the latter. So, in Arab Stated there are 28% of illiterate male population and 52% of illiterate female population. It south Asia it is 34% and 56.
