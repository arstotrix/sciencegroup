There is no doubt that one of the aims of education at school is the acquisition of thorough knowledge about the world and society. Nevertheless, a range of non-academic subjects is presented in the school syllabus, which causes controversy. The question arises whether such subjects are required.

In my opinion, non-academic subjects are an integral part of education. Firstly, they develop other skills than subjects demanding only brain activity. Moreover, these lessons provide students with opportunity to distract from contemplating problems posed at academic lessons. In addition, a part of students can succeed in those particular subjects and reveal talents that would not be noticed if there were no such subjects in the syllabus.

On the other hand, profound knowledge is significant for future success and some people state that non-academic subjects prevent students from acquiring it. Excluding them from the syllabus would contribute to amount of knowledge gained be children and amount o time students can devote to academic development. As for non-academic subjects, they can be presented as electives.

I strongly believe that the absence of non-academic subjects might result in students being under stress because of the overwhelming amount of mental activity without physical exercise and other activities which are provided by the non-academic subjects.

On the whole, non-academic subjects are essential for balance in educational process. Providing students with necessary skills, they help students stay healthy and knowledgeable not only in academic matters but also in areas related to everyday life.
