It is generally believed that there is no sense in making children who are not talented in art visit classes of drawing and painting. Other creative or practical classes can be much more useful for them. I completely agree with this statement. 
Firstly, all the people have different potential for arts , and it is not fair to estimate works of all the students by certain mark system.A child can be very hard-working but not talented in arts, he/she will not achieve great success in it even if he/she does his/her best. Thus, such kind of classes can be stressful for students. The same story about the obligatory classes of music at school. For example, my mother has no ear for music and she told me many stories about how she was upset with her not very good marks for music classes and how stressful it was for her.
Secondly, for some children studying such subjects is A waste of time. From my point of view, students should have an ability to choose what subjects to study. So, in case if they lack artistic talent, school should give them a list of subjects which can be chosen instead. A person who is genius in physics can learn drawing, get bad results in it without knowing that he can achieve great success if he choses physics classes instead.
To summarize, students shouldn't be encouraged to attend classes which have powerful negative impact on a child's nervous system and feelings. It might be a good idea to focus students' attention on subjects which they are interested in and help them to progress further.
