Nowadays more and more people believe that students should devote all their time at school to the academic subjects, not to the non-academic ones.

As far as I am concerned, non-academic subjects, such as physical education, cookery (for girls) or even hobby groups are considered to be an important part of the learning process. I believe that students attend classes in order to become well-educated and intelligent. Moreover, school education gives them an opportunity to gain new knowledge that can help them to achieve a success in their future life. 

However, I think that students should relax from long and sometimes very boring classes and non-academic subjects can help to achieve this goal. Sport, for example, can help them to restore energy, to relax, to keep always fit and healthy. Otherwise, they will become tired and exhausted and they will not have enough energy to learn better and to receive new information during the lessons. Cookery, for instance, may be very useful for girls, because they will not only relax, but will also learn to be good wives, who can cook delicious and incredible dishes for their future husbands and for a family on the whole.

All in all, I assume that it is a false belief that non-academic subjects disturb students. Undoubtedly, they should not be removed from the school curriculum, because no matter what you do, you must not forget to relax for a little in order to achieve better results during the learning process.
