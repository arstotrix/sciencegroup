The graph shows information about the number of digital 3D screens that were produced in the period of 7 years (form 2005 to 2011). 
Looking at the graph, it is clearly seen that starting from the second half of 2005 the number of digital 3D screen that were produced began to increase.  In just almost 7 years the figures went from 0 to approximately 38000. It is also can be stated that from the year of 2008 to 2011 the number of 3D digital screens saw a sharp increase (going up from 3000 to 3800).
The chart illustrates the information on the global 3D cinema releases divided by two types: live action and animation.  We can clearly see that starting from 2008 the number of 3D cinema releases increased dramatically (going up from 5 to 75). It is also can be clearly seen that in the beginning of the observation the ratio between animation and live action was about 1:2. Then at the end of the period it became about 3:1.
 To summaries, looking at both the chart and the graph, we can state that the number of digital 3D directly correlated with the number of 3D cinema releases.
