The graph illustrates the change of preference in choice of accommodation of students. Overall, the most popular type of accommodation (room in a shared house or flat) increased but stayed the same through all five decades. 

In 1960s the most popular types were room in a shared house\flat as mentioned above and accommodation with a host family (35% each type). This was far higher than two other  types: students’ hall and home with family, which had approximately 15%. However, throughout five decades the gap between the first two types increased because percentage of choosing shared room doubled whereas percentage of students who stayed with host family decreased in more than half. 

In comparison with these types, the other two changed slightly. The percentage of students who preferred students’ hall kept changing between 10-20% whereas the preference of staying home with own family decreased gradually to 5% and then float again to approximately 13%.
