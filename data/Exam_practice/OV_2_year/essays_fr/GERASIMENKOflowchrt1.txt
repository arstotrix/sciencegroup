The diagram represents the process of consumer goods manufacturing and the pattern of information flow accompanying it.
Production begins with the acquisition and storage of raw materials and manufactured components of the intended product. In the meantime, product research is carried out. Its results are relevant for design which influences the production planning. When the production is planned, feedback is obtained how materials should be stored, and the assembly begins.
After the product has been assembled, it is inspected and subsequently tested, which provides new information for designers. Meanwhile, market research is conducted, its results being also relevant for the design of the product. Moreover, its outcome has a profound impact on advertising process and on packaging.
Tests having been performed, the product is packed and despatched for sale. Sales show the efficiency of the whole process of manufacturing and provide valuable feedback for market research and production planning. The information obtained enables the adjustment of the production.
