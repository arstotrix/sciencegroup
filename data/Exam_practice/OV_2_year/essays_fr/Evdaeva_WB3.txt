Art classes at school play an important role in the development of children and teenagers. Nevertheless, there are people who believe that students who do not have artistic abilities should spend their time on more useful and interesting subjects for which they may have more aptitude. 

In my opinion, this is the wrong approach.To begin with, people think that painting and drawing classes should be removed from the school curriculum of those children who lack artistic talent, because it is just a waste of their time. Moreover, if talented classmates succeed in drawing but children who cannot draw well do not, their self-esteem can drop and they may feel depressed.

I disagree with this statement and personally believe that while you are a child, you should learn all subjects that are included in the curriculum, because you are not old enough yet to understand what subjects exactly will be useful and necessary for your future life and profession. First of all, there are a lot of famous artists who were not good at art subjects at school, but then started to create masterpieces, which we can admire until today. Secondly, even if some teenagers do not have outstanding skills in drawing, it might be enjoyable and educational for them. Furthermore, art can help children to express themselves and their feelings.

All in all, I assume that all pupils benefit from art subjects, such as painting and drawing, because such subjects broaden our horizons and give us an opportunity to relax from other difficult academic subjects.  So, I think that it is not pointless making children who lack artistic talent learn art subjects, because, as people say, no knowledge is ever wasted or to be despised.
