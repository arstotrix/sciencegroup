The map shows two possible variants of sites for a new school planned to be built in Canterbury. The former comprises building the school in the countryside close to the housing area. The latter implies that the school can be built in the town centre. 
As far as the first site is concerned, it may be quite green which could be advantageous for children.  At the same time, it is close to one of the main roads and, therefore, unlike the second site, first location excludes any inconvenience concerning getting to school by car. The drawback is a considerable distance between the school and the town centre and most of the housing area. Moreover, being closer to Sturry it is further from Chartham, which may prevent children from the second town from attending the school.  
As for the second site, the distance between the school and housing area as well as both cities is approximately the same, comparing to the first site. However, the absence of traffic zone in the town centre is likely to cause problems with taking children to school by car, which may be convenient for some parents.
Both sites are equally distant from the university. On the whole, the variant of building the school in the town centre could be more preferable as distance plays an integral role as far as school is concerned. As for traffic, the school is planned to be located not far from the border of pedestrian zone so the problem mentioned above can be considered minor. Thus, the second variant could be more suitable.
