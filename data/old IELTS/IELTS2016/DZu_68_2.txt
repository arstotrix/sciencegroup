Nowadays global warming and air pollution become one of the most important problems all over the world. Some people think it contributes by air travel, but others disagree. So, let us consider some facts.
As far as I am concerned, that air travelling cannot affect to air pollution the most. There are a lot of other factors. Also, it is impossible to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. Firstly, it is a well-known fact, that air travelling became the most popular way to travelling last 15 years. And if people stop flying how do they accross the Atlantic, for example, or other destinations? They will travel by boats, which will take more time and give more different fumes for air pollution. Secondly, global warming is a long process and it seems to me depends on companies and plants too. From this fact we see, that the government should reduce the amount of them too, which is necessary for country. But not all people share my point of view. They believe, that introducing laws will be stop global warming. They believe, that if people are not travelling by planes, the amount of gas fumes in the atmosphere can decrease.
But, I strongly believe, that it is better to introduce other laws to stop air pollution. Maybe it is better to plant trees and open different projects for solving this problem, like an eco-projects.
To sum it all up, better to say, that the government can affect to air pollution and global warming, but not introduce laws to reduce the amount of planes. There are a lot of more useful ways to solve this problem.
