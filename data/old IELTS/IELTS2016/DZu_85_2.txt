People live in a modern society. Time is accounted to be a great value today. Almost every person tries to save it, using, for example, the fastest kinds of transport. Air travel is useful invention for contemporary world. However, it has lots of drawback. Pollution and global warming are one of them. Should the governments reduce the quantity of air travels?
I suppose that the restriction of such kind is going to be harmful and useless. How the one or two laws would regulate air travelling sphere? There would be many other factors to control. For example, huge crowds of businessmen and tourists will need to relocate using different kinds of transportation. The explosion of its capacities would be needed. Moreover, various organisations will have to hire more and more staff in order to sustain working process in a proper way. Secondly, such laws would be a disaster for a national economy. Air travelling is a giant sphere that brings money to budgets through various taxes. Reducing this, government will have to find other way to fulfill their “wallets”.
To sum up, introdusing the restrictional laws is the last way to help to our nature. People should overcome the problem of pollution properly. It can be reached, for example, by reducing every “dangerous” sphere by little.
