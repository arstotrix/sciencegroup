The given graph illustrates how investment in renewable energy changed over the course of 7 years (from 2006 to 2013). The figures are given for both developed and developing countries and as a world total. First of all, it is clearly seen from the graph that starting from the year 2006 the amount of investment in developing countries saw an upward trend: starting from a bit less than 25 $ Bn investment gradually increased to about 110 $ Bn and then in 2013 it decreased to approximately 80 $ Bn. As for developed countries, overall amount of investment was significantly bigger but the figures were fluctuating reaching their highest point of about 175 $ Bn in 2011 and the lowest point of approximately 100 $ Bn in 2007. The figures for world total were flactuating as well with the highest amount of investment of 279 $ Bn in 2011 and the lowest of 168 $ Bn in 2009. To sum up, it is important to note that investment in renewable energy in developed countries is far more significant for the world market.
