Many people considered that air travelling causes a great air pollution and a global warming. There is an opinion that a lot of travels are unnecessary and it should be reduced by law.
there are two sides of this question.
On the one hand, air pollution is a big problem of modern people life, and the damage to the environment caused by this is really big. One of the disasters it can lead to is Global warming. Even today for example in Alaska there are rapidly rising water levels and ice erosion. Many towns and settelments in Alaska are affected by it and are in danger.
But on the other hand, air travelling is a little part of the problem. Air pollution is caused not only by flights but by such things as factories, big amount of cars in cities, and many others. The main problem is in the whole technical progress, not only air travelling.
To sum it up, it’s important to say that definetely, air travelling causes a damage to environment, such as air pollution, but people should look wider at this problem. There are many ways to change the environment situation, and reducing the amount of air travel is not the best solving for this question. People can build less factories, buy less cars and some other things. So, government shouldn’t reduce air travelling.
