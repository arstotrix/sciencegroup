There is no doubt that nowadays, in comparison to past times, there are a lot of families all over the world in which both spouses earn money and therefore have to reduce the amount of time spending on family relationships and especially on their relationships with children. It is also can be noticed that more and more children have different problems and challengings which their parents are not able to take part in. As a result, it leads to generation conflict and misunderstanding between such closest relatives as children and their parents. Firstly, the possible reason, which is forming this quite conspicuous problem, is that the modern life working conditions motivate people to find work in office and spend there 6-8 hours of their day. Moreover, work places of vast number of people are often really far away from their homes which is also forcing people to spend 2 or 3 hours a day to get to this work. All of it creates all atmosphere at home when lots of parents are able only to pick their children up to school and have dinner together. One of the possible solution of this problem is to modify most of current jobs in terms of on-line working conditions, which can give people a chance to work at home and to be involved into their children life more consistently. Secondly, it can be underlined that the number of women who put their career in the first place increased sharply during the last century. It also can be true reason why lots of modern families face problems of reducing of amount of time which such families are able to spend with their children. The situation may be changed by using a time-management. Parents should plan their day better in order to find time for their children. They also should scarify their own spare time to be sure that they pay enough attention to their children.
