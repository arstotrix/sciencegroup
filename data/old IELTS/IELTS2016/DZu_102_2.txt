We live in 21 century and sometimes we can’t imagine our life without air travel. In fact this method of transporting produce a lot of air pollution and global warming. But for my opinion government should not reduce the number of flights.
Firstly, air travelling is the most fast type of movement. I think that our life is too short to spend it in trains and cars when you can travel by air. Also I think that planes is most comfortable and safe type of transport so we need to use it. In 19 century people spend weeks and months to get Asia from Europe. Now you can end this journey for 10 hours. This as awesome.
Secondly, our government should introduce laws to reduce the number of pollution, not flights. They should write laws that make flight companies to set up some modern filters in their vehicle. I think that it can cardinally change the problem with air pollution.
Some people, who stand against air travel, usually say that amount of toxic and poison elements can not be reduced by filters, according to them, flights are dangerous. To this people I can say that there are millions of cars all over the world, which spoils our air too. If we want to reduce the number of air travel and planes, we need also to demolish millions of car, to solve this problem in complex. This will stop human progress for hundred years.
In conclusion I want to say that planes and fast travelling became a big part of our life. Majority of humans in Europe and USA use this type of moving very often. If we want to solve the problem of global warming and air pollution, we must use another methods. Our future can’t exist without air travel.
