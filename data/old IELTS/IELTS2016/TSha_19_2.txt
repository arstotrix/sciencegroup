Nowadays there are a lot of colleges and universities which include only female or only male students. Usually they are close and elitary places and in other universities the numbler of girls and boys is fluctuated. As a result, some people believe  that universities should create equal places for males and females. But, to my mind, it is impossible.
First of all, there are some jobs, which requare good physical conditions and specific sides of character like politely or keeping calm constantly. It is hard to imagine that a lot of boys pass exams in the medical university and then become nurses or medsisters. Also we have a few policewoman and woman, who work in the millitary sphere.
Secondly, the visiting of subjects is a choice of every student. If universities create the qwote of number of male and female students, some girls and boys will lose opportunities to visit theese lectures  becouse free places may be ended. In developed countries with the highest level of education and with large opportunities of studying, it is impossible. In my opinion, universities should get a chance to choose subjects by both male and female students.
In connclusion, I would like to say that the getting education is the choice of every studend. Universities and goverment should not prevent it, accepting equal numbers of lecture visitors. There are a lot of special universities and schools, there is opportunity to study for only girls and only boys. So, I think that this dividing will have not benefits in the future.
