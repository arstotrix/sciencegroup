Nowadays, we show a great concern about the environment and try to act eco-friendly. As air travel has been proven to affect the level of air pollution, governments should creat laws to reduce the number of air travel for leisure and business. 
This point of view is hard to agree with. Firstly, airplanes became part of our life. It is hard to imagine the trip to longdistant areas without them. Secondly, air travel is a huge business that will lose a pile of money if the law is introduced. If it happens it will also have a large impact on the world economics which no one wants to have.
On the other hand, it is impossible not to think about the environmental problems the air travel causes. Nowadays, when we fight anything that may lead to a global warming such threat can not be overlooked.
However, there are some problems with the realisation of the laws that intends to reduce the amount of air travel. One of them is the control issue. Government may order aviasales companies to lessen the number of flights, however, it can not influence people's minds and other companies and firms needs for trips.
To sum up, despite the problem of air pollution the reducing of air travel laws are hard to be introduced because of people's habit, economic problems and non-aviasales companies needs. So, if humanity wishes to safe the environment it has to think of other ways because this one has a lot of issues.
