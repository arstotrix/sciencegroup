The charts represents how the amount of children without access to primary education had been changed from 2000 to 2012 in three different regions, such as Africa, South Asia and rest of World by gender.

First of all, the number of girls, who did not have an opportunity to get an education was bigger then numbers of boys without this opportunity in 2000 all over the world. However, in 2012 the tendency had not changed only in Africa.

The most dramatic decrease of the amount of such children was in South Asia, from 32,7 millions to 9,9 millions. In contrast, same index in other regions became smaller on a quarter from 43,7 to 32,7 millions and 23,3 to 15,3 millions in Africa and rest of World respectively.

The worst result was got in Africa, for example in 2012 this index was more then three times bigger then in South Asia, 32,7 and 9,9 millions respectively.

Overall, globalisation and increasing the living standards could explain aggregative tendency of decreasing the number of children without access to school education during those years.
