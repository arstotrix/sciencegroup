The graph presents information about differences in investment in renewable energy, which took place over a 7 year period from 2006 till 2013. The graph provides 3 types of data: about developed and developing countries, and a world total. The most noticeable point is that developed countries invested much more than developing ones during the whole period. It could be seen that amount of money invested by developing countries increased all the time. In 2006 they invested about $ 25 billions in renewable energy, while in 2012 this amount was more than $ 100 bn. After 2012 there was a decline so in 2013 developing countries invested less than $ 100 bn. Whilst investment of developing countries increased steadily, there were some fluctuations in developed countriesâ€™ investment. To start from about $ 80 bn the sum of investment reached its peak in 2011 a bit less than $ 200 bn were invested. World total amount of investment altered on this background too. In 2006 the sum was $ 100 bn, from 2009 to 2011 it dramatically grew and reached a peak with $ 279 bn. Overall, the general trend which graph shows is the increase of investment from 2006 to 2011 and the fallowing decline in both developed and developing countries and total in the world.
