There is an opinion that the most efficient way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences, but not everyone agrees with that. On the one hand, there is a point in that idea, because if a murderer, for example, will be kept in a prison for a longer period, he won’t be able to harm other people. Such strategy in some way isolates potentially dangerous people from other world.  But on the other hand, there are several downgrades in that approach. Choosing that way of coping with crime implies that we presuppose the impossibility of personal changing. By isolating criminals the justice doesn’t give them any chance to become better and stigmatizes them as excluded from the society for the rest of their lives.  To my view, there could better ways of reducing crime. First, we could try to think about reasons which causes crime activity. For example, to my knowledge, there is a proved correlation between an average income level and an amount of crimes. So, if government imposes very high taxes and the average wages are rather low, probably changing state financial politics may help to reduce crime. Second, government can try to improve methods of working with prisoners: provide psychological help, pay more attention to their education and so forth.   To conclude, long prison sentences may be considered as effective in a way that they don’t help to cope with problem, but rather hide it. And if we won’t to reduce crime level, a deeper analysis of social situation in country is needed.
