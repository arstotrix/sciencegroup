Today people can not imagine their lifes without using transport such as cars, trains, plans and so on. It is really convenient, but there are some ecological consequances of using this machines. Speaking about air travels we can see that it involve air pollution and grobal warming because of burning fuel that sent into atmosphere. There is an opiniot that goverment should introduce several lows in order to decline the number of flights. I somewhat disagree with this statement.
I agree with the position that amount of air travels should become less, because harmful things that sent into the atmosphere during burning the fuel are cause some issues such as global warming, air polution. On the one hand banning some air trips help to decrease harmful consequances for nature, but it can not solve the problem. There are a lot of transport, that burn the same fuel.
Fmom my point of view goverment should introduce laws that support science which create  ecological fuel, for example, machines that worked on water. The air trips the fastest way of trawelling, therefor it is the most convenient in modern life. If the government introduce laws that reduce the amount of car travels, it will be more useful, because there are a lot of cars and partiqurary everyone have a car. Some people believe that many cities today become a one big trafic jam. Reducing the number of cars can help to decrease burning a lot of fuel and then to decline the harmful consequences. Today many people in big cities prefer using a bycycle.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the introducing laws that reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure is not useful because there are a lot of another harmful transport that have bad influence on environment.
