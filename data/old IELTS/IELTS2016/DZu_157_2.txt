Aircrafts provide the opportunity to travel fast and with comfort. There are some opinion about huge damages are produced by planes. Should the modern humanity take control under to air sphere?
I believe that government should enact the laws which regulate the air surface. Unfortunately, the 20th is a proof of harmful activity of humanity and that is the reason why nature started be aggressive to people, it becomes the reason of tsunamies, earthquakes and etc. I suppose 21st century should show the appropriate way of communication between nature and people. The travel limitation could be a good example of proper attitude to the mother Earth. I mean not only reducing the amount of air travel, cars also do a huge impact. Car sharing is positive sign of attention from peopleâ€™s side.
Moreover, restrictive acts should touch not only transport sphere, also industial factories should get energy from unlimited nature sources like sun, wind and etc. It definitely helps to improve situation with air pollutions.
Otherwise, there are some people who have a different point of view, they assume that air travel restriction could not help and, moreover, cause new problems linked with communication. For example, a person who achieved the limit of trips by plane could not to reach another part of Earth in emergency cases like family troubles. This rule is violated our freedom in such situations. I think that this problem could be solved easily by exeption in the law about emergency cases, in this way people could reach any part of Earth in critical situations.
To sum up it should be mentioned that people have to pay attention to nature conditions and try to protect environment for our future generations.
