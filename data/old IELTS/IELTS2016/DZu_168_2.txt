Nowadays some people suppose that air travel is one of the causes of air pollution and global warming. Introducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure is offered like a decision of the problem by such people. As for me, air travell does not pollute atmosphere as it is made by other things. So, it is not the main reason of global change. In my essay I will try to prove my point of view.
On the one hand, air travel is used in contemporary society all over the world every day. People travel by planes for business and leisure because they have wish, money and opportunity. Obviously, goverments can introduce laws to reduce the amount of travel but it is decreasing of human rights. As for me, it is better to make prices higher for plane tickets and then less people have opportunity to travel.
On the other hand, it is silly to ban our travel in any way because it will not be so effective. Much more reliable is to decrease number of caus which pollute the planet a lot introducing carbon dioxide. Goverments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of cars; for example, only one car for one family. Another opportunity to improve the situation is to make cars working with solar energy cheaper.
All things considered, global warming is an enormous environmental problem and it should be solved but not by reducing our travel which is necessary for both business and leisure.
