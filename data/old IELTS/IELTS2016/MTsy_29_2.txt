Some people regard air travelling as a way of air polluting and one of reasons of global warming. They take into example some evidences. so one need some methods of restriction of exploiting airships. For example, reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure. The question which is arising is whether to limit the amount of acting transport or not to. Consequently, there are two opposite views.
I do not agree with this suggestion for governments. Firstly, I cannot understand what is a criteria of necessity of air travel. How some people decided that one business trips and leisure trips are necessary and other are not? I think it is subjective to a certain extent. Second reason which I am not for reducing the number of flights by is that, on my opinion, there is not alternative kind of transport. Air ships are convinient because of their speed, comfortability and ability to shift on long distances.
Thus, I believe that such measures as banning of a part of flights is not the optimal measure, because it seems to me that there are other ways of pollution which are more detrimental, and in order to save the environment, one should begin with them.
