Today, our world rapidly changes itself. Life of people becomes more convenient because of modern technologies. And air travelling are available for most of people. So, there are a lot of plane flights every day and this situation plays a big role in ecological condition of our planet.
Some people think, that air travelling is one of the most harmful things for ecology. But, to my mind, it is not so. There are a lot of other various problems for our planet. For example, cars. Their harm for environment are much larger because of the quantity. Every day billions of cars pollute an atmosphere with litres of gases. Actually, this factor is in the first place in the list of problems to my opinion. But it is not possible for governments to forbid car riding, because of their convenience in our life. Thus, air travel is not so considerable problem for us from the ecological point of view. Aircraft industry rapidly develops, all over the world. It changes our life, positively influences economics of most countries and promotes world technological progress. If governments reduce air travel, we will walk some steps back in progress time and will injure all humanity.
