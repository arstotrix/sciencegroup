It is believed that air travel harms greatly our environment, making such problems as air pollution and global warming. Somebody thinks that new laws that will reduce the number of air travel, should appear. As for me, I totally disagree with this opinion because I think that it will not help people to avoid these problems.
Firstly, I think it is necessary to say that reducing the number of flights and maybe cancelling them, will not solve such problems as air pollution and global warming because there still will be many other things that will cause these problems.
Secondly, everybody knows how popular is travelling nowadays. People spend a lot of money for the journeys of their dreams, in such form helping to the economies of many countries. Such countries as Spain will not exist for so long without travellers, because nearly the half of the economy exists with a help of tourism. I think that reducing of number of flights will make many people angry, because they choose air travelling because of its comfort which is provided by air companies. It is well known that nowadays thravelling by plain is more comfortable and faster comparing with other transports.
In conclusion I would like to say that government should better make laws in other spheres, such as education and medicine where changes are really needed or should better control people who really damage air environment.
