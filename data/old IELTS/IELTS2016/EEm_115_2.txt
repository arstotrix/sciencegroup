It is not a top secret that that airplains and transportation in common brings lots of disadvantages to the air “health”. Nevertheless, governments should not control the amount of travellers because of such situation. In this essay we will discuss such an issue.
First of all, it should be mentioned that movements from continent to continent, country to country is nowadays a need for businessmen, workers and for spending holidays. Air travel is the only way to move faster and to prove the pace of your life. Law reducing will not help the solving of environmental problems but will cause economical troubles in lots of countries.
One more argument is that air population is caused by lots of factors. Manufactures, cars and so on damage the ozon layer and air not less the airships. that is why we can match that reducing the number of passengers will not save the nature.
Last but not least, the laws to reduce the amount of air travel is not the best solution. Much more environmentally save will make an technical laws to air companies. This way to protect is better for all the consumers and producers. Each air company will buy new transport and producers will get an possibility to develop technologies.
However, some people and organizations like “Green peace” do not see the disadvantages and their main reason is that decreasing of passengers will cause the decreasing of airplane’s park all over the world. Laws will give a chance to discover new ways of protecting the air environment of planet which would be able to help next generations to survive.
To sum up, my opinion is that technical laws of airplanes standarts, economical development caused by the increase in air technologies and business duties of all the people around the world overweight the disadvantages of reducing the number of passengers travelling by air transport by laws making.
