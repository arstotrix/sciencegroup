The given line graph depicts the amount of money spent on renewable energy between 2006 and 2013 by the whole world wide. The bar chart presents information about two groups of countries: developed and developing. As for as the line graph in concerned, the investment experienced a rapid growth during the first 2-year-period from 100 $ bn to 171 $ bn. This was followed by a slight drop in the year 2009. But then trend recovered and rocketed to 279 billions, reaching a peak of investment in renewable energy. Next came a rapid and remarkable fall to the level of 214 $ bn. What about the bar chart, the data about developed countries absolutely copies the world trend. Their investment saw a moderate increase firstly, dipped a little jumped to the peak of about 180 $ bn and went down significantly to the point of 214. Developing countries showed continuous growth reaching a peak in 2012, as opposed to developed countriesâ€™ peak in 2011, and then started to fall. Overall, what stands out from the figures is that not only apparently developed countries spent more money on renewable energy sources than developing ones, but also that world total investment in this area correlated with countries of developed level in a considerable way.
