In the process of inductrialization the ways of usage of the air transport has reached a wide rage. It’s obvious that more people fly more than make a contribution to the environmentall pollution. However, I share the author’s opinion only on 50 percent.
According to scientists’ claims global warming is to be unstopable without any strict measures. Only governments, as the monopolists o fimposing prohibitions or frames on this od that people’s activity can prevent our planet by the air pollution which is one of the main reasons of global warming. For instance, the politicans may involve some borders for the number of flights to be taken inaconcrete perion of time and huge fees for the air corporations as a penalty for not following the rules.
In fact, there are some negative consequences of these measures for ordinary people. It’s clear if such a category of laws will ‘-regulate air traffic world-wide companies will try to get their money by increasing the price of the tickets. It seems to be very actual for business and leisure flights because these groups of plane usage construct almast all the air travelling sphere. That’s why it would touch almost everybody’s wallet if governments dropped serious actions to reduse the quantity of flights. As a result, it will contradict the world’s tendention to industrial development and globali ation.
In the conclusion, to save our environment politics ough to juxtapose the introduction of specific rules which will control air travel with the ability of simple citizens to carry out their own businesses and activities. In other way it will lead to unpredicted consequences.
