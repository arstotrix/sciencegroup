Some people believe that there are too much enviroment today. In the same tie other people think that this way of travelling is the most convinient, that’s why they are not going to change the way they usually travel.
I partly agree with the second point of view and have my own thought on this topic.
First of all, I agree with these people because I suppose that plane is the fastest and one of the most comfortable way of travelling.
Secondly, I am sure that air travelling is not the main cause of warming and environmental pollution. According to my opinion different fabrics make much more harm for our nature. In this case it should be more important to think about all these fabrics, also about cars which cause global warming too. In other words, there are so many causes which are more important than air travelling about which we just don’t mention.
But on the other side there are too much airplanes owned by different businessmen now. Moreover, some of them use this kind of transport very often.
Due only to that fact, that our nature spoils by airtravelling, the amount of flyghts of rich people should be reduced. But it shouldn’t have any influence on travelling companies which just help tourists to get from place to place.
But everyone knows that with a desire everything can be done even with a banning law. That’s why I suppose that rich people will be able to find different tricks to travell anywhere by plane.
Summing up, I’d like to say that, of course, we have to take care about our nature, about everything that makes our life easier. But goverment can’t just reduce the amount of flyghts even because of themselves. As all of us know they use it more often than anyone else. And as I support the second point of view, I suppose that people should take care about all problems which a connected to our enviroment and try to find sutable solves.
