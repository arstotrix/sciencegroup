Our environment at the edge of global catastophy and air travel have a significant impact on it. Could we allow governments to decide the amount of air travel to reduce air pollution and avoid global warming? I think it would be wrong. First of all, I want to clearify my opinion. It is a common knowledge that man’s activity damages our planet a lot. All factories, gases, transports lead to unchangeable and global consequnces, but it also makes our life better, our travels more comgotrable and faster. Refusing from it would not be a solution of all problems we have on Earth. It just remides refuse from technical development and back to the past. Today we allow government to control our flights to reduce the risk, tomorrow they won’t order to build houses and cars by hands and after tomorrow they would say we must ride the horses instead of vehicles. I believe that more regulation from government in private life would not solve the global problem, but create another. Secondly, air pollution and global warming is concerning for everyone, not only for politics and not only them have a power. Sewing our environment is an exellent purpose which needs everyone to be involved. Not use achols, drive eco cars are eco friendly cars, grow more plats and trees around your home, find alternative sources of energy and using solar energy are things we could do. Build houses from natural thing for as to do. It does not require something special from people. All we need is just to want save our planet. All in all, the whole process is a long-term, there are many solutions to avoid the catastrofy of environment has been suggested and more are uncovered. It is absolute dear that sewing Earth is not mission for politics, but mission for humanity, and control our lives by governments is not the way to complete it.
