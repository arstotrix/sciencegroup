The charts give information about changes occurred in using Facebook network among people and produce some reasons for this changing in the period from March 2012 to March 2013.    First thing to be mentioned is that there is two noticeable changings: the reduction in amount of desktop users from more than 140 million to less than 140 million people and the highly increased number of people who use mobile phones from less than 60 million to nearly one hundred million people. Now the reasons for using Facebook should be discussed. In 2013 39 % of people say that they use this network for sharing photos or videos, while in 2012 54 % of respondents gave that reason. The reason called "receiving updates" maintains through years. In 2013, comparing with 2012, less people use Facebook to see funny pictures or learn about ways to help others. It is also must be said that the biggest number of respondents use Facebook network as a mean of sharing photo and video materials and the lowest number as mean of learning how to help others both in March 2012 and March 2013.   After all, the amount of people who spend their time in this social network is decreased if we compare March 2012 and the same month of 2013 year.
