Nowadays there is a discussion of air pollution and global warming because of air traveling. Some people think that amount of traveling by air for leisure and business should be shortened. Other people believe that it is impossible to be done.
I agree with extension that amount of air traveling could be and should be shortened. Firstly, in modern world there are plenty of other ways of traveling, some of which are even more comfortable and convinient than air traveling. For example, whole Europe has modern railway trails which make traveling by train fast and comfortable. Secondly, most of the time people travel by air just to save some time and because of facilities and leisureness of such traveling. However, it is obvious that saving environment from pollution is more important than that.
Nevertheless, there are arguments for air traveling. The most significant one is that sometimes it is impossible to use other ways of traveling. For example, traveling between continents is possible only by plane or sea, and sea traveling is obviously longer and sometimes is not suitable. Moreover, sometimes person needs to get to another destination fast because of many reasons, e.g. business problems, so the only way to do it is by air plane. For example, some people cannot travel by sea, car or train due to sea illness and so on.
To sum up, it may be concluded that both sides have their arguments. However, problems of pollution and global warming are real, so society, government have to do something with it. The one of the ways in this sphere is to reduce the amount of traveling by air wherever it is possible.
