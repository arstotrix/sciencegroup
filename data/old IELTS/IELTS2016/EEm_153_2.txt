These days we live in the modern international world where different far regions need to be conected in everyday life because they depend on each other. Moreover, air transport is the fastest way that we know to communicate between countries even though it gives away tremendous amount of wastes.
In my opinion, there are no other ways to travel so fast on a far destination which people with average income will be able to afford. Furthermore, air travel is one of the most achivements of 20-21 centuries. Without them our world would be much more complicated.
There is no doubt that air transport is one of the safest ways of traveling which were ever know on Earth. The statistics says that it is less dangerous than car or train transportation.
As far as I am concerned, there are numerous countries in the world that depends on tourism such as: Turckey, Maroco and a lot of europien residents. In case if air traveling will be declined those touristic parts of the world would be far gone into crisise.
Meanwhile, talking about such things as: air pollution, global warming and other climate issues on Earth.First of all, in order to incrise those conditions we should change the all structure of energy in the world and get rid of every oil litter that is used to provide energy, because otherwise by prohibiting air transport would only effect weak economics.
To summerise, air travel is one of the most urgent benefits of human kind and as all benefits come with price this one is not a exclusion. For now, we have to come up with something more innovative or just silently deal with consequencise.
