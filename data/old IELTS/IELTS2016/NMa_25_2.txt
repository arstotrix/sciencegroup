How many people use air travel? I am sure this number can not be a small. The air traver is very quickly, comfortable that important to business and leisure, but we unusually think about air pollution and global warming. And a lot of air traver is unnecessary, some people sure, we should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel.
So, ecological problems always were our global issue. Air polution, of course, one of the most important in this day. If number of airplanes which go up and sit down every day will be less, I suppose, we would be to brecthly easy, the air would be clearly. Besides, it is more safety to travel on train, and it's very expensive to use airplane in often trip.
In the over hand, the air travel is most quickly. The speed of airplane approximately 800 kilometers per hour. It can be very important for business trip. And the airplane is one of the most safety view of transport, without train. It is really a little chance to goes.
I partly agree with ideas about reduce the amount of air travel, because this transport more useful. I think, we should create the way to travel on air without troubled to air.
