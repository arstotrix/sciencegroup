The author supposes that air travelling is one of the main reasons of pollution and global warming. He says that it is the politician's task to tako some measures in order to reduce the number of air travel. 
As for me, I'm totally disagree with this statement. Because, on the one hand, airplanes threw some gases to the atmosphere, and it can damage the ecology. But it is well-known fact that the most of flight companies ude ecological fuel for their airplanes, as a rule, cerosine. And the damage effects from using this kind of fuel are much less than the pollution, providing by using cars, working manifactures, e.t.c. It's proved by scientists that airplane fuel is more ecological in many times than gasoline, or gases that factories give to the air. So, they came to the conclusion that using cars can give our planet much more damage than using air transport. Becaue the most of gases, which is left by airplanes in the air don't get down to the Earth, but mix with air on the level of around 10000 metres.
As for the global warming, I can say that there are a lot of another reasons for it. Last saturday I saw a documental film "The Global warming" on the Discovery TV-channel. And there were not any words about the damage effect of using airplanes! But producers gave a lot of arguments that the main reasons of global warming are gases from factories, too much cars using by people and the global changes in world's climate.
Overall, I can say that the author's opinion is not correct for 100%. Of coure using airplanes can cause som bad effect on the ecology of the Earth, but there are reasons that are much more important, and governments should pay more attention for them.
