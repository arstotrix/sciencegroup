The problem of pollution is an issue, which is often discussed in today’s world. Some people claim that air travel has a strong effect on our environment. At the same time, their opponents do not share this opinion. They argue that plans cannot pollute the air.
On the one hand, air travel may influence our environment. When we use plans, they produce some harmful gazes. These gazes may improve air pollution and global warming. In this case, new low, which will be created to reduce the number of air travel, may be really useful. As there are be less gazes, which pollute the athmosphere.
On the other hand, the reducing of air travel may have a negative affect on people’s life. Some families, which live far away from each other, will face the problem of disconnection. They will have some difficulties to arrange meetings. Moreover, such low will affect on the economic situation in the world. Enternational companies will not have an opportunity to lead their business. Unfortunately, the income there may be deerful. And world’s economic may face the erises. The consequenses of this situation will be seen on the population of developing countries. There will be more people, who live under poverty line. So governments will be able to introduce new lows, in order to overcome difficult economic situation.
To sum it up, the prevention of air travel may lead to some more dangerous incomes, than air pollution. Besides, global warming and the pollution of the environment are results of other human’s activities. And their travel can not be the main reason for their existence. It means that lows, which prevent air travelling, reduce air pollution.
