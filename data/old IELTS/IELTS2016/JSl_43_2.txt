There is an opinion that air travel harm to environment. In this case, governments should control this process via laws and tax. As I can see, it will not decrease pollution but decrease our opportunities to travel. Let us start to consider my point of view. To begin with, if governments will introduce new laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure costs of air company will increase and price of tickets will increase too. It is means that less and less people can use air travel. Instead of this, they will travel but other types of transport such as train or ship. Moreover, it is commonly known that trains have effect on environment too. It is means that people switche to use another types of transport which pollute air more than air travel. In this case, introduction of laws is unnecessary. Some people suggest that the reason of reduction air travel is that a lot of air travel is unnecessary. To my mind, it has certain benefit for people. For instance, each person in every moment can use air travel and pay less money. Furthermore, on the market the machanizm of supply and demand force the number of air travel to efficient amount without certain laws.  To sum up, governments should not create prohibitions for air travel because all types of travel are connected and reduction of air travel will cause only increase in price of ticket while air travel is necessary for people.
