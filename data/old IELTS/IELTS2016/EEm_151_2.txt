Nowadays there are a lot of people who strongly believe that travelling by plane could damage the ecology by air pollution and it is the main reason of global warming. Nevertheless, other people think that air travel is the most fastest way of travelling and the government should not introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel of business and leisure.
To start with, global warming could be caused by the number of reasons and air travelling is just one of them. For example, nowadays there are a lot of cars in big citys which are making dirty air atmosphere. Another important factor is that it is very popular to travel by plane and if the government introduce the law about reducing the flights it will be a reason of high prices on air tickets. Moreover, some people will lose the oportunity to see the world because of high price on travelling in generall.
Other measures could included that today there are a really big number of planes which are empty - fly very seldom. for instance, it is depend on unpopular flights and flexy timetable. It is true to say that if we would like to think about our environmental a little bit more our planet will be more eco-friendly to us in the future.
From my point of view it is incorrect politic to reduce the number of flight fro business and leisure. But what is need to solve the problem is create some programs to reduce waste and so on.
All in all, there are a lot of reasons for different ways of thinking and I respect all of them but I strongly believe that people could not stop the global warming just by stopping to fly.
