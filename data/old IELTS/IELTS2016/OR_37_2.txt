We live in the world where air pollution became one of the most important and major problem in our lives. To solve this problem some people think that governments ought to deal with that by air laws and took. But others argue that a lot of air travel is unnessary and we should not do anything. One of the most important responsibilities of government is a regarding envirement. That is why authorities ought to able to make laws for protecting our air. Perhaps it can be taxes on vehicles. Espessially for big cities where pollution problems are very crucial. Of course many people can say that our air is too much and nothing will happen. But I think they make a rude mistake. If we do not consider and carry about our nature (including air) it can lead to global warming.
