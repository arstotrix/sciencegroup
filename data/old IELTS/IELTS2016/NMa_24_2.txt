Nowadays, there are a lot of pollution problems on our planet. It is hard to argue that any air travel harm our atmosphere too much. Moreover, airplanes contribute to global warming, that is one of the most important world's problems. Some people believe that reducing the number of unnecessary flights can help to fight with these problems. However, I think that such solution can not solve this issue fully, because there are many other factors that impact world's pollution and global warming.
Firstly, I should say about air transport. With the developing of the ways of human transportation people invented the fastest one â€” air travel. It seemed to be the most comfortable, because of the ability to reduce time, needed to travel from one point to another. Air transport opened the world, where it was real to get to any place, for example, in 2 hours instead of 1 day. However, the damage that is caused to the environment is obvious even for a kid. People think that these fuel is the most harmful, but they do not think about other ways of transportation. I mean, the reducing of the amount of flights would lead to using such types of transport as cars, for example. It is cheaper to drive a car when person is travelling, however it is clear that it takes more time than travelling by air. Furthermore, the amount of car drivers is really huge, so their fossil fuels pollute nature greatly that is is even more dangerous. So, it is more useful for government to provide citizens with reducing car driving, which pollute more, and to encourage people for travelling by air that is saferand more ecologically friendly to the environment. 
To sum it up, I should say that the number of flights should not be reduced be laws, because air transport does not damage Earth as much as other way of transportation.
