Travelling by airplanes has a great popularity nowadays although such type of travel can really harm environment, air and water. Also it can cause greenhouse effect and, finally, global warming. The question is about government’s possibility to make laws about concrete amount of travelling by airplans as well as business or adventure trips. To my mind, such laws will abuse and ignore human rights exceptionally human Right of Movement. First of all, there are incredibly great amount of fabrics and factories, which also cause air pollution and global warming. So, air travel is not the only reason of pollution. Secondly, a lot of people can’t imagine their life without travelling, further more, air travel is the most comfortable, convinient and fastest nowadays. In addition, there are types of people, for whom such laws of reducing the amount of air travel will lead to the ruins of their business. Finally, as it has been said, such laws will ignore human rights, which are universal and inalienable. It is essential and vital for people to travel by their with as long as it used intellegently. To sum it up, in my humble opinion, governments should protect our environment different ways. It may sound straightforward enough, but  it gets incredibly complicated, as soon as anyone tries to put the idea into practice. Nevertheless, not only governments should care about environment but the ordinary people. For example, we can produce more ecological things and think about the amount of water and energy spended every day. Eventually, I guess that laws to redce the amount of air travel undoubtedly haven’t to be introduced. Governments should use another methods, which are not disturbing universal human rights.
