In our time, a lot of international firms prefer having their manufactures in the 3rd world countries, employing local workers. It is argued if moving the business to poorer states brings more advantages or it causes disadvantages. On the other hand, opening a manufacture in particular country which belongs to the 3rd world helps save a lot of money. This usually includes lower salaries because local workers often do not have a higher education or they just agree to be employed by an international company because of its popularity, prestige and so on. Moreover, the rent of offices and factories in developing countries is much cheaper than in developed countries, which estimates firms to move their business to poorer states of the world. For instance, famous fashion houses like Chanel, Versace, DKNY have several factories in South Eastern Asia. On the other hand, local workers from the 3rd world countries may cause the lower quality of company production. The problem is that many emplyees do not have specifie skills for some kind of jobs, but they are employed despite of this fact, making company save its money. For instance, the quality of some brands phones has become poorer recently, and maybe due to their manufacturing in China and other Asian countries which are at the low stage of development. However, nowadays many international companies take the quality of their goods seriously teaching their workers useful skills. To conclude, moving business to the 3rd world countries has both positive and negative impact on the international companies. I, personally, believe that a multinational firm could gain its profit and save a lot of money by opening a manufacture in a poorer country only in the case if its workers are taught how to do their job in a professional and provided by all the necessary things, which are needed for their work.
