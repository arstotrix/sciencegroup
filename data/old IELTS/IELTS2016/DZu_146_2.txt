Nowadays, the lack of environmental protection is very actual issue. There is a fact, that usage of aviation has a great impact on air pollution and makes green-house effect. They say, quantity of aviatrips should be declined by governments as it is not necessary. From my point of view, it is not appropriate measure for solving the problem.
First of all, there are many other factors, that influence on ecology. For instance, wastes from cars, trains, factories are not less dangerous. This measurement will not be a solution, but it will create many unconveniences.
Moreover, almost all air travel is very essential part of contemporary life as there is no more efficient and fast way to have a trip to do business, than planes. If there is no flights, humanity will lose its time in traffics even more than now. There would be great queues in railway and bus ticket departments.
However, not everybody shares my point of view. They say, useless flight should be reduced by state laws as half-empty planes are uneffective economically and destroying for nature. At least this solution will decline growth of green-house effect.
Taking everything into account, I want to declare, that this issue is very ambiguous. I partly agree with my opponents, but the reduce should not be great as it will distruct economics. By the way, there is a need to solve the problem from another side with other methods. For instance, to grow trees and plenties that produce oxide, ar to close unefficient and dirty productions factories.
