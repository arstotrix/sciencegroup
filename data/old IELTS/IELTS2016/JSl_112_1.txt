Presented picture illustrates worlds differences in the amount of investments in renewable energy in a period between 2006 and 2013. Overall, it can be seen from the graph, that the number of money that was invested in renewable energy in developed countries is considerably higher than in developing ones during all the period. In detail, the share of total worlds investments was rapidly increasing over the 5 years from 2006 and represents a significant upsurge from the bottom most point of 100 to the highest mark of 279. However, after 2011 an abrupt decline is shown and in 2013 the amount of investments reached the point of 214. As fro developed countries there was a steady uplift to 2008, when an unimportant decrease happened. But from 2009 to 2011 the amount of invested money was increasing and reached the mark of well below 200 from the point of well above 100 in 2009. After 2011 the results are reducing. Investments in developing countries were showing a gradual uplift from the point of nearly 25 in 2006 to the highest mark of well beyond 100 in 2012, but investments accounted for about 85 in 2013, that mean falling of the money, that was invested in renewable energy in developing countries.
