Nowadays, a lot of people donâ€™t think about air pollution but it is very important problem and one of the reasons of pollution is air travel.
Firstly, people should think about pollution because we are living on this planet and it is our home. To solve this problem people should think about alternative ways how to travel. For example, if you can go by train better to do it because are ecological type of transport. But air travel always faster than trains and you should buy tickets earlies than trains and make you time management.
Secondly, goverment should introduce laws or take more tax from private plaines. It goes positive because goverment can spend money from tax to solve ecological problems and of course air travelling not only one reason of pollution. Same situation is car with engine because planes have the same engine and it is critical for ecology. Goverment with scientists should solve this problems because nowadays we can see hybrid planes and cars. However, technology is very expensive and oil companies are needed in money. The have lobby in goverment and it is more important problem. Because to make clean our planet we need to change our opinion about the usual things. People must think about the problem of pollution and they need to have education because to know problem easier make ways to solve it.
In conclusion, today we have a lot of problems, every person have his private problems. But we should not forget about everyone problem and it is pollution. We live on this planet and we vote for our goverment and they should write laws to save our home because we can not be egoistics. Not only goverment must solve this problem but and all people. Every person must know that engine is worst for ecology and people need focus on alternative resorses like wind, solar energy and others.
