There is no doubt that justice should be fair and criminals should get punished according to the crime committed. The system should also prevent further crimes and, accordingly, a question arises whether longer prison sentences are efficient. Some people believe that the longer a sentence is, the more fear it evokes in the souls of potential criminals. Prison is considered to be hell on earth and it is supposed that a person would try to avoid it by all means if the sentence is long enough. Furthermore, longer sentences prevent a person from having a normal lifestyle for more years, which can be a terrifying perspective. Apart from that, dangerous prisoners could be kept away from society for a longer time and, therefore, cease to threaten life of people. On the other hand, prison changes a person rapidly so that criminals adjust to life there. It is obvious that prison alters people not depending on the length of the sentence. In addition, a lot of workforce kept in prisons doing manual work would not contribute to the economic welfare of a country. Moreover, longer sentences mean higher expences for a state, which can also have a negative impact on the economy. Consequently, economic instability may lead to crime rates increasing. Thus, this measure may turn out to be counterproductive. To my mind, longer sentences would not be efficient in reducing crime. I presume that introducing an improvesd system of fines is a more reasonable and plausible solution. Not only do they punish criminals and prevent people from committing further crimes, but they also can become a source of income for a country.
