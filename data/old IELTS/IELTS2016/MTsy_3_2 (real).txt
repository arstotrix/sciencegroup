Some people think that air pollution is a great problem of our modern world, but other think that travelling by plain is the most comfortable way to get the place you want.
The question is to decide what is better or what has more commons.
On the one hand air travelling is one of the most safe ways of getting somewhere. Moreover if we are talking about long distinations, it is unpossible to get their by train or by bus. If there is chance to get by this transport it will take a lot of days, and it is just waste of time or money. People, which travel for business, fly just for 2 days, and they will be not agree with the laws, which governments introduce. Besides, air pollution is a problem nowdays, not only because of air transport, there are lot of other causes for it.
On the other hand, air trnsport by itsself is created from damage for person materials, such as aluminium, and consists of boxing which pollute our autmosphere. Moreover travelling by train or bus can be much interesting, as you will see a lot of picteresque places of interest, take a lot of photos which will remind you about trip all your life.
To sum up every person should decide for himself what transport is good for him, there should be no rules which tell us what to choose. Even if the amount of air travelling will be reduced, the impact of other damage sourses will be no changed, and the world will be polluted in the same way.
