Some people believe that travelling by planes is harmful to the environment. However, others argue that air travel has become one of the most important features of 21st century. 
Although planes are useful for communication between different parts of the globe, they are causing pollution and other disadvantageous effects related to it. Firstly, they use a lot of energy and produce gases which destroy the atmosphere. Secondly, as the air traffic became really busy recently, it started to create noise and discomfort for people. Thirdly, as a lot of air communication is absorbed with business issues of global companies, ordinary people do not actually have profit from it.
On the other hand, almost every person likes travelling and therefore planes are being used by ordinary people almost as much as by corporations. It would have been nothing but sensible to start establishing taxes for all plane users with an attention being prid on the amount and volume of used traffic. If people want to be fair towards the environment, they should not divide themselves from other members of the global community. However, as someone could predict it would be difficult to change everyone for using planes equally, so big corporations would have to be more engaged due to a bigger extent of disruptive influence they cause to the environment.
In my opinion, the problem of pollution is very urgent nowadays and the air traffic is being a part of it. On the other hand, there is a plenty of other pollution causes and planes are just a part of a technical progress. Hence, the humanity should pay more attention to all pollution producers and not forget to look at the mirror at the same time. As no law or regulation on air traffic would help the Earth to remain healthy as long as people are causing harm to it on every day basis.
