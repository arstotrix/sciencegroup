Nowadays, many international companies move their businesses to developing countries and employ local workers. Their reasons are rather clear: the salary they should pay to their employees can be much less than in their home country. But is is good for the developing countries in which they move? And is it good for their own country's economy? I think that advantages of this development are more significant than its disadvantages. Firslty, it provides a possibility to get the job for local people, which could be not so easy to find without the businesses of these international companies. Otherwise, it can make troubles to local business, but this fact can be fixed by taxes that the international companies would have to pay. Moreover, those taxes can be a good aid for the local economy. Secondly, the profits, that international companies get from the movement of their businesses, can let them make the prices lower not only in the country where they move but also in their home country. Then, international companies can bring some goods, that are not produced in the country where they move. The appearance of such goods can not only improve the level local people wealth, but even create some new markets, which would be able to stimulate the local businesses. For example, the appearance of "Coca-Cola" in Russia gave local businesses an opportunity to make their own coke or other beverages like this as it has become much more popular than it had been before.Of course there are some disadvantages of movement the international companies' business to poorer countries, as it can be difficult for local companies to share the market with such giants, but, as I have already said, it can be fixed by taxes.
