The bar chart provides us information about changes in amount of money invested in renewable energy between 2006 and 2013 in developed, developing countries and in world. Overall, it can be seen that investments both in the world and developed countries faced a period of rise up to the year of 2011, while developing countries continued to increase their renewable energy investments and faced a decline a year later, in 2013. One of the striking features is the fact that though investments of developed countries fluctuated throught the observed period it can be noticed that there is a correlation between them and total worldâ€™s investments. They both dipped slightly in 2009 and also both reached their peak in 2011: 279 bn $ were invested in total, about 180 bn $ were given by developed countries. Another interesting feature is that investments made by developing countries were increasing steadily up until 2012. When they reached a peak of more than 100 bn $ invested, after that, in 2013, a slight decrease in amount of many invested was observed.
