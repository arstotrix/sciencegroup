In recent years there is a tendency of large companies to move the process of their production making on the territory of countries with the smaller level of development. Of course, this industries moving can provide  the citizens of poorer states with job. However, this process also has an impact on the country, where that business moved from. Below I will discuss both positive and negative sides of this issue. on the one hand, if the largest companies move their industries to the developing countries, it will cause the environment state transformation. To make it clear, when some of rich and developed countries move their main factories to the poorer one, the amount of pollution would became not so high, as it is nowadays. The concentration of the damaging substances in air and water will distribute more evenly through the world, what can undoubtedly improve the ecological state on the planet. On the other hand, if the biggest companies will move their industries to the other countries, the level of unemployment can drastically increase. As an instance, huge amount of factories workers will be left without their jobs. It would be considerably difficult for them to chanche the sphere of occupation or, as an alternative, to get the education of the other type. So, such industrial moving can became a reason of countryâ€™s labour market problems, although the poorer countries win. In conclusion, despite the fact that the moving of business to the developing areas can strongly improve the environment state in the whole world, it can also cause the labour market disbalance in developed and developing countries.
