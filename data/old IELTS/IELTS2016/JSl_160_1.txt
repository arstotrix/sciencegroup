The illustration gives an information on the renewable energy investments in countries with the different level of development in a 7 year period. Overall, as can be seen from the graph the sum of the investment in this field reached a peak of 279 billions of dollars in 2011. However, the sizes of the investment sums are not the same in the developed and developing countries. It is clear that in states with the smaller level of development investments steadily increase since 2006 to 2012, where they exceed a 100 billions of dollar mark. In the next year after that developing countries slightly decrease their payments on renewable energy. Despite the fact that the investments of countries with the smaller level of development rise approximately on 70 points. It can not eventually reach the level of high-developed countries. Furthermore, it can be noticed that the level of renewable energy payment fluctuated during the all period in high-developed countries. The peaks in the different types of countries are not alike. However, to the end of shown period the differences between countries as for renewable energy investments, gradually decrease from 40 to 20 points on vertical axe.
