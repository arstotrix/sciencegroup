The pick of it was in 2011 when the amount of money donated to the environmental program reached more than 150 bn $. Developing countries also payed attention to it, however, as it could be seen from the graph, amount of money invested in, during the same time period, always was much more less. The pick of activity of developing countries was in 2012 when it reached a little bit more than 100 bn $. The main trend of the graph was the sharp rise of amount of money since 2009 and to 2011. After there was a dramatic decline until 2013.
