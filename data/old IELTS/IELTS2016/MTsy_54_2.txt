Some people think that air pollution and global warming are depend on air travel, that is why they are sure that governments should introduce laws to stop air travel if it is not for business and leisure. Other people consider that air travel does not influence on atmosphere and they can continue their travellings by using the plane. I partly agree with the second view.
On the other hand, it can be observed that almost all of planes use destroyed material for flying that is why there are harmful gas in atmosphere which pollute air. In the othe words, if people start use, for example, trainf, they will help up to safe air and stop global warming.
On the othe hand, why I am sure that air travel is not so harmful how other people believe is a modern technology. Modern technologies can people not only solve personal problems, but also save our atmosphere, because if we returne on 20 years ago, we could see that it was other planes with destroyed materials and harmful gas. Secondly some people feel more comfortable when the travel by plane, because they are sure that everything will be ok, they have a good service and the moving is faster that is why nervois people keep calm.
In conclusion I would like to say that air travelling has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming, but mostly it is not so dangerouse as 20 years ago. In the contrary it is safer and travelling by plane is more convenient than other ways of arrivings.
