In developing countries unemployment is a frequent problem, and employment of local people rises the wealth of population and of government itself. But not only the host country gets profit: an employing company makes profit on cheap working power, because employees from poor countries are ready to work for less only to have a possibility to earn some money for living. &nbsp;To continue, there is a range of disadvantages. The first one connected with a treat of a company to local employee. As a fact that is eventually spoken about in mass media, local workers are often treated badly during the working period. They do not get enough sleep, the conditions they work at do not correspond to stated norms and rules.
