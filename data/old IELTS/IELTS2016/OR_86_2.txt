There is no doubt that the last century has given to people an amazing possibility to travel around the world by air. Some people have a great need in any kind of air travel, however, there are those who think that governments should create laws in order to reduce air travels and air pollutions that air travels have influence on. Personally, I tend to think that amount of air travel should not be reduced. First of all, people prefer traveling by air to any type of other travel because of possibility to make the journey faster. No other kind of transport may be as fast as train is. Secondly, todayâ€™s airplanes use some kind of oil that can not be named as hio (or natural) one, however, is safer that it used to be many years ago. Last but not least, the redundance of air travels may provide troubles and conflicts between people. For instance, one may have no opportunity to take part in one important business meeting somewhere because of the lack of the tickets. Admittedly, there is an opinion that traveling by air leads to problem in ecology (air pollution, global warming). That people argue that spechial laws may change the situation, so they do their best to influence politicians. To sum up, I want to say that I strongly respect opinion of other people, but I believe that my view point about necessaty of any type of air travel is right because morden planes are safe enowgh and are created in order to minimalize problems, dealing with air pollution.
