Nowadays people travel by air all over the world every day. On the one side, air travel can cause air pollution and global warming, but in the other side, travelling by air is the most convenient and fastest mean of transport. In my essay I will present some cons and pros of air travel. To begin with, planes burn millions tones of fule during every flight. As a result, it can cause air pollution. Moreover, it results reducing of the oxygen and ozone procentage in the air which means that it is really hard to breathe freely. Secondly, it has been proven that air travel contributes to global warming. That means that world ices begin to melt and the average temperature on the planet grows. This can cause the rising of sea level and changes in coastlines. On the other side, air travel is the most convenient way to move. People believe that it is more likely to travel with children by plane because it is not so energy consuming like travelling by train or bus. Moreover, plane trips take less time than another means of transport. For example, if a person would like to get from Saint-Petersburg to Anapa, it will take him 4 hours travelling by plane and nearly 2 days by train. To sum up, weighting up pros of air travel like convenience and fast of travel and cons like air pollution and global warming cons will definetely overweight. To my mind, governments should reduce the amount of flights as it is harmful for the environment. If we wonâ€™t prevent the damage of the nature, we would not have any space where to live.
