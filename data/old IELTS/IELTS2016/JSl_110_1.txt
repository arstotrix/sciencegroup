Overall, the amount of money, spent on renewable energy has changed significantly over the period, though the patterns of change were different. As well as the world total investment, the quantity of money spent on renewable energy by developed and developing countries, has reached the peak in 2011, accounting for 279 dollars in world total investment and accounting approximately for 180 and 100 dollars in developed and developing countries respectively. However, despite having almost similar tendencies , as is observed, the amount of money spent on renewable energy by developed countries is almost twice as that of developing countries, in particular, accounting for approximately 25 dollars in 2006 and more than 50 dollars in the same year by both types of countries.
