There is a danger from air pollution and global warming caused by air travel. Some people say that goverment should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure and consequently reduce air pollution. From, my point of view it is not good idea, cause due to speed of nowadays aircrafts they are the only opportunity for millions of people to get the destination point in sufficient time, second problem is the problem of law. So the thesis is that a lot of air travel is unnecessary, so governments should introduce laws to reduce amount of air travel for business and leisure. Firstly, it can be reduced if only can be find sufficient alternative to air travel, but we can not see alternatives on modern market. Second, due to the fact that we have no alternatives as fast are comfortable as air travel, we can not reduce amount of air travel. Law issue. First of all, we should invent judicial, law mechanism which will reduce amount of air travel around the world, so it is about international law. It will not be easy to cooperate, because every country has its economical and political interests. Second law problem is that introducing laws to reduce air travel for business and leisure government hits rights of different groups of people (businesmens, tourists, average citizens) by banning them from air travel. In my opinion, government have no right to behave like that. To sum up, I want to say, that is we have some kind of technical problem, we should not reduce the volume of right of average citizens, but increase brain activity to solve technical problem.
