The graph represents data about investing in renewable sources of energy. As it is clearly seen, the investments had been increasing until 2011 and then began to fall to 2013.  Generally speaking, developed countries invested more in renewable energy than developing ones. Though it seems that difference of the amount of investment between two counties fluctuates: it decreased from 100 billion to 50 billion than rose to approximately 150 billion to 2011 and then fell again. The number of overall investment increased from 100 billion dollars to 279 billion dollars in 2011 and then decreased to 214 billion dollars in 2013. However between 2008 and 2009 it remained steady about 170 billion.  Â  Overall, the amount of investment increased from 2006 to 2013. And both developing and developed countries started to spend more money on renewable sources approximately twice more in 2013 than in 2006.
