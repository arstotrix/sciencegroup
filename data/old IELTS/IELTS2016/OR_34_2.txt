Nowadays in many modern families we can see, that both parents work, and their children spent less time with them. The main reason is that child needs money. If parents are going to make a baby. They need many things – from pampers and child’s bed to the good education. Also we shouldnot forget about medicine – while the woman are pregnant, she spents much money for that. The older kid is, the more money he or she needs. When child is grown up, he or she need the education, and on the West almost every education must be paid. The situation becomes more serious, if you have more than one baby. Cause of these reasons one parent just has not possibility to pay everything by himself or herself. To solve this problem parents usually try to find a good nanny, who can seat with child or children while parents are at home. But the logic is very simple: if you stayed child with nanny, he or she would be chanding. In our country the idea of nannys is not very popular. Russian people prefer to stay child with grandparents. In my opinion, nanny is not a good idea, I will not stay my child ith stranger, even she is a nanny. I think people should to find an other way to solve the problem. In the conclusion it can be added, that there is no sence to be a parent if you do not spend enough time with your child. The best way, of course, if you have opportunity to not to work both parents, but, unfortunately, often it is not an option.
