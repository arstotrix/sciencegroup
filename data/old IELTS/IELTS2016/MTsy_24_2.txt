It goes without saying, that in our modern and rapidly change world the atmosphere is polluted with millions tonns of dust, so it is extremely significant to find wys to prevent this catastrophe. Governments are of opinion, that banning unnecessary air flights is an effective way to save the environment and to prevent global warming. This essay will examine my point of view on this burning problem.
As for me, I am the follower of the theory, that government should not reduce the amount of flights in order to tackle environmental problems. Firstly, air travel is necessary for travelling on huge destinations. It is fast and convenient for business people, for families to reach the place they need. Besides, there are millions of foreign visitors in every corner of world, who used plane to get there. But what if the air flights would be reduced? All these people will use buses, trains, cars for travelling, so the atmosphere will polluted with dust more than even now.
Secondly, if businessmen and ordinary people will not get an access to air plains, unternational unions are going to be destroyed, because will be no opportunity to communicate with other communicate with other countries as well as before. Furthermore, ordinary people and families will not have an opportunity to visit foreign countries, to develop their minds and broaden their look.
Thirdly, not only planes contribute to global warming and pollution. Factory and plant furms, people’s wastes are more harmful for our planet, that only planes. So it is extremely important to take some measures to cut the quantity of another sources for atmosphere’s pollution.
To crown it all, it can be said, that society must ensure steps are taken to prevent the environmental problem from deteriorating futher, and the reducing of air travel is not the suitable way to tackle this problem.
