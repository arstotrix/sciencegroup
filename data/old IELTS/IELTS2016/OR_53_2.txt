The problem of air pollution and global warming has become extremely vital in the last decades. As it has been proved one of the main factors which contribute enourmously to this problem is air travel. Thatâ€™s why I strongle believe that introducing some laws to reduce the amount of flights must be introduced by government. First of all, a lot of air travel is really unnecessary. Thousand of people use air travel for business and leisure when they can choose another ways to get to their destinations and not to pollute the air. The main reason is that air travel is the fastest, the most comfortable and the most convinient way, but if the government introduce laws that will prohibit such amount of unnecessary flights, people will have to change to more environmentaly friendly ways to travelling and such restrictions will be very effectively. What is more, reducing the amount of air travel will lead to changing people willingness from flying abroad either for business or leisure to traveling to another areas of their own country which does not require airplanes. This will be an intent to the development of national tourism and infrastructure of the towns which in turn will encourage more money in these regions which government later can use to address the problem of air pollution and global warming. To sum it all up, I do think that air travel hadly influences the situation of global warming and air pollution and reducing unnecessary flights will help to solve the problem either in short run and longterm periods.
