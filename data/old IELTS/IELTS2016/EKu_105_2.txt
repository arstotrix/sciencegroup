In our days big developed companies  known all around the world have a tendency to locate their business centres to the developing countries. Are there more pros or cons of such actions?From my point of view, such developement makes enough advantages for both: internarional companies and  poorer countries. First of all, companies can save their money on paying less money workers from poor countries. It is also a good way to get economical profit for developing countries. They get money  from international companies for their factories are located on the teritory of the developung countries. Then developing countries can spend this money on further developmet of their country  There is also an adventage for people of the country, where this bisiness center is located, because they have  a low level of life and many of them cannot find  work to get any money to grow their children. And international factories can give them a chance to improve their live (by paying them salary). But, on the other hand, rights of these people are not always  equal comparing to rights of the workers from other countries, for instance, from Europe, that is why many of these poor people get deseases and die because of being so much tired and exhausted or end their lives by killing themselves.To conclude all that I have written, I want to say  that that location  international  factories  and employement of local workers is  a quite good idea. But they should not forget about rights of people. I think, this process hase to be controled by special international comitue, which should be founded in few years.
