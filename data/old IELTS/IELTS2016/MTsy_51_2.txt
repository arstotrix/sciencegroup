Nowadays, one of the most popular mean of transportation is plane. However, using planes leads to serious ecological problems like global warming and air pollution. That is why some people think that goverment should decline the number of air travel. I disagree with this point of view for several reasons.
The first reason why I have the opposite to such statement opinion is globalazation. In modern world communications between countries become closer and you can use this situation for both: leisure and work. For your leisure activities you can use plane as a way for travelling, for meeting with other cultures, people, for seeing the lifestyles which are opposite to yours. Also, air travel are more commonly use for business. Nowadays, there are a huge amount of international companies which have their business in many countries in the world. That is more, people are more often go outseas to find a better place to work.
The second reason is a advantage of plane from other means of transport. The air travel is the fastest way to get almost to any place in the world. It is convevient because, for instance, using train you cannot cross the ocean and so on.
Summing it up I would like to say that air travel is an important part of modern person life. In my opinion, government should have a politics which leads to decreasing harmful effect of using air travel rather that introduce special laws which will decrease the number of air travel and get the globalization worse.
