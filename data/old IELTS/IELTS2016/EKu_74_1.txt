On the graph below are depicted the changes in worldwide investment in renewable energy.&nbsp;As a material for analysis into consideration was taken information about developed and developing countries. &nbsp;The world total level of investment in renewable energy has rose up rapidly in 2009, reached the peak in 2011 and gone down in 2013, ending with the investment level of 214 billions of dollars.   Every year developed countries invested more than developing countries, the level of investment varies from year to year. The slightest difference is reached in 2013 with difference of 40 billions, comparable with 2010, when the difference in investment was the most dramatic – nearly 70 billion dollars. Furthermore, in 2006 the level of investment in both developed and developing countries was less than 80 billions, comparable to 2013 with the maximum of 130 billions in developed countries. Comparing the constant and stabilized growth of investments in developing countries, with a fall in 2013, the growth of investments in developed countries is wavy, with downs in 2011 and ups in 2009. This is the end of my report.
