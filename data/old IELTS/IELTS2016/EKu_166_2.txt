There are a lot of businesses nowadays which are going to poor countries and chose for working local people. Of course, there are pluses and minuses of this situation. On one hand it looks like an advantage because people in such countries can find work, help there families. It goes with out saying, that it is very difficult to find job in developing countries. This situation helps to take up the rate of living in such countries. More than that businesses provide their locations with support with some parts of life like medicine, education. Besides, it seems to me that with a good life, countries begin to think about developing ther own situaition. On other we can not ignore disadvantages of this theme. When businesses prefer to give job for local workers they leave people from their country without. It is clearly that workers from other countries are more cheaper than from their own ones, but they can do work worse than their native people. d anThat is why the quality suffers. Further more, such cases can be a reason to unemployment in countries and can cause to low standard of living. Such typicall problems can lead to alcogolism, drug addiction and high rate of mortality. I hope, it is a great diadvantage for those businessmen who love their countries and think about it's future.In conclusion, I think it is nesseary to summyrize that when international companies move their businesses to developing countries they can give them a chance to develop, but leave the tribesmen without work.
