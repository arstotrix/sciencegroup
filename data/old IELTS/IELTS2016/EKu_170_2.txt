Nowadays there are a lor of crimes and some people believe that increased prison sentences will lessen the amount of crime. Others suppose that we can find more productive and better ways of decreasing crime. Here I would like to write about the problem of reducing crime and give my opinion about it. Many people think that the best way of reducing crime is to give longer prison sentences. They think so because there are many cases when prisoners become really different person in a better way after a long sentence. They become better because they have more time to think about what they have done, they try their best to become a new person with a new life. Also, long prison sentences are good because there are such persons who can't live in a normal world with laws and morals. So it will be better for all if this kind of prisoners stayed in prisons for a long time. However, there are people who believe that there are better, alternative ways of reducing crime. They think in such way because now psyhologists have many different unique methods that can help prisoners to become better even without longer sentences. Such methods can be more resultful because prisoners will have a chance to change their thoughts and find solutions of their problemps with the help of specialits. Also, there are prisons in which prisoners are not living in a routine thinking about ways to escape. For example, there is a prison in Phillipines in which prisoners dance instead of simple walks. In this prison the most dangerous prisoners are becoming more peacefull and friendly. In conclusion, I would like to write that I think that such ways of changing people in prisons like in Phillipines are more succesful and probaply it will really reduce crime rates in the future.
