Modern world had to solve the global and widespread problems of our environment, caused by people living in it. One of these issues is pollutions and global warming by air travel. Some people think that the authorities should improve this situation by reducing air travels. I absolutely disagree with this decision and I will try to explain why. First and foremost, air travel is not the only one thing which pollutes our environment. There are such issues as pollutions by factories, cars, cutting off the trees, etc. One of the perfect ways to decrease air pollutions is to create or find a new energy resource, technology, which can replace things providing bad conditions to the environment. In addition, reducing the amount of flights is connected to the consfictuonal right of people. It is all about the freedon of the movement. People have possibility to travel by air and they always should have possibility to use their right. The last but not least, if government reduce the amount of air travel, people will have to use other ways of travelling. For instance, travelling by sea also contributes to water pollutions, as other transport does. To take into account, I would like to emphisize, that the authorities should not to strict people rights. The are a lot of ways to cut off pollutions by finding alternative energy sources and improving engineering technologies.
