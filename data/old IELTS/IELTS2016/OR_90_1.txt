The graph compares changes in the number of children who could not enter primary schools over a period of 12 years by gender and region. In 2000 around 44 million of African children had no access to primary education (23.7 million of girls and 20 million of boys), so there was clearly the biggest number of such children. However, the figure decreased to 33 million (18.2 million of girls and 14.5 million of boys) in 2012. The same number of children (21.6 million of girls and 11.1 million of boys) had no opportunity to enter primary schools in South Asia in 2000. The rate fell dramatically to 10 million of children (4.8 million of girls and 5.1 million of boys) in 2012. Finally, the number of children without access to primary education in the rest of world also significantly declined from 23 million of children (12.8 million of girls and 10.5 million of boys) in 2000 to 15 million of children (7,6 million of girls and 7.7 million of boys) in 2012. Overall, the number of children who could not enter primary schools sharply dropped everywhere during the period.
