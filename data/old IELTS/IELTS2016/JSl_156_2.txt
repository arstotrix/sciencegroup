Many global companies move their businesses to poor, developing countries. On the one hand, the great number of people believes that owners of the companies have a   great changes, which can improve their businesse. On the other hand, some people find it very strange, when the territory of the company is changed. In my opinion, this changing of the company geography is a new step in development. First of all, the place,building, machines for businesse are cheap in poor country, so removing company can be a solution to save money for the other parts of the businesse programme. In addition, the local market of the workers in developing country consist of unemployed people without education, which can work at factories, forms and other companies, which connect with agriculture and production. Finally, the businesse from already has a really benefit for poor country, because the level of unemployment decreased, the company is improved by the budget of the businesse. More over, the companies can open special educational courses for workers or have a changing programmers with other countries. All these facts can afford to increase the all spheres of country, not only economy, but also education, culture and international links. However, this companies in poorer countries can only use the resourses of the country without any exchanging and benefit. They can be a reasons of population and great damaging of nature. To sum up, I tend to belive that moving businesses in developing countries is a really useful poeticial programme of the company which has more advantages than disadvantages.
