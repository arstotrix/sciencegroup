Somebody suppouses governments should introduce laws for air travel when it is unnecessary fro protection Eerth from global warming. I think these purpose has some advantages and disadvantages.
To begin with, there are many reasons for warning about air pollution and global warming. Air travel is not the only one. I think, firstly we should think about all areas, which cause on it. Moreover, everyone should start from themselves. There are a lot of companies and they are reason for bad air pollution too.
Ait travel saves our time. Travel by car or train can take much more time. Then, time is one of the importans things nowadays. In my opinion , every person should make desicion about transport personally. And government should not introduce laws about it.
Nevertheless, others can support this idea about changing air travel on travel by car or train, because they think it is saffer. But it is not. Every year thousand of car are crushing and millions of people are duying. And all of it depend on people, who drive car being no sober or who has not careffully drived. While your air travel is caused by pilot, who was teached for it many years and go over many tests.
To sum it up, nowadays people can say no to air travel. It saves your time, money and your life. Maybe in the future we will find new way to travel and not to make bad to our planet.
