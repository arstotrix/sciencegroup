From this graph it can be clearly seen 3 curves, which have been showed proportions of population with age 65 and more in Japan, Sweden and the USA.
According to the japanese curve, it should be noticed the growing down tendency from 1940 to 1960. During approximately 27 years the rate remained steadily on the constant level at 3%. The analytics predict the rocket increase from 10% to 25% and before and after this change the proportion has risen.
On the other situation in Sweden there was the rhytm of population, which has a cyclic growth, like an economy. It can be clearly noticed that the Swedish curve has 2 periods of falling, but the changes were little and they couldn't be compared with rates of growth.
At the USA the temp of curve's change is similar than in Sweden. But considering the difference in the proportions Sweden has the growth bigger, than in the USA.
To sum up, in all countries the proportion of elder population has the increase, but in Japan it is more than in Sweden and in the USA.
