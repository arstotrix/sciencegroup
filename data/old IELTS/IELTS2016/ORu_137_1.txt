The line graph illustrates changes that occurred in sharings of global smartphone profits over the period between 2010 and 2015, sharings are given in percents. The main trend is that Apple’s profit share has been increasing during this period, while other companies’ shares have seen their downturn. To begin with Apple’s most significant competitor – Samsung, the line graph shows that both companies’ revenue shares were going up quite consecuantly until 2012, when Apple’s profit share started declining, reaching its dip in 2013, just as the same year when Samsung’s profit share had reached its peak. 2013 was a critical point for both companies, however after that Apple’s share of profit in the Market started to grow rapidly, comparing to Samsung’s decrease in shares. HTC’s and Blackberry’s shares remained quite steadly during the period between 2010 and 2015, although some moderate decrease can be seen during the last 3 years. Despite the fact, that in the beginning of the 2010 Blackberry’s profit share was nearly twice as high as HTC’s, during 2012 the last’s profits share had overweightens Blackberry. What is more, these companies face almost the same situation in the share of global smartphone profits since 2013.
