Today, many people consider that transforming by a  plane is a catastrophic mistake, because it influences on environment destroying. Also, they suggest to enter limited transforming with pleased on government's power. I absolutely belive, that it is incorrect solving of a problem.
Firstly, it is unpossible imaging current life without air travelling. It is same living without electricity. Many people adore journes, and seldom somebody cannot live without this activity. They want to  show and narrate to their offspring about different countries. Hence, without a plane it will do so hard, if even unpossible. Furthermore, these people have a journey in a holidays time frequently. After this activity they feel energy and work productivity.
Secondly, nowaday, the level of migration and emigration is high. All migrates need transfer, particulary by a air transport. If they do not be sutrisfied, it can create dangerous situation in the world. For instanse, it can carry to bounts, crashing or even a civil war. Many people will die, and govermen should not allow to creat this horrible situation. 
However, air travelling has a terrible influence on environment pollution, and on atmosphere particulary. The using a air transport frequantly destroy our world. The lack of fresh air will create new horrible problem. This problem is defetition of air. And it lead to the hiest level of dieing.
In a briefly, using air transports is an accuate issue. In spite of environment pollution, people still transfer by a plane. The main reason is unsatisfiing of people. They will work un productivity if they spend their holiday in a different contry. And yet, it can lead to civil war from migrates.
