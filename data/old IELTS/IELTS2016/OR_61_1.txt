The graph indicated the number of children who were not able to get a primary education in 2000 and in 2012 in different parts of the world. In Africa more infants could not study in both periods rather than in South Asia and the Rest of World. The figures of boys and girls differed negligibly in 2000 whereas in 2012 the number of male youngsters decreased remarkably. The reverse is true for South Asia. In 2000 the gender played a great role, so that boys got access to education two times often than girls. In 2012, however, the situation changed and the amount of both sexes became relevant, 4.8 and 5.1. Contrastly, in the Rest of World changes were not so dramatically. The statistics decresed by approximately 5 millions in both cases: with girls and boys. However, if in South Asia the amount of infants without access to primary education became noticeably low and standed for about 5 millions in the Rest of World figures stayed high in 2012.
