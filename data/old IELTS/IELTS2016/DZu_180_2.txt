Nowadays, people are become being alarmed of climate and environmental problems more and more. Thus, we still have problems with pollutions. Air travelling, indeed, influences a lot on our atmosphere, and international law and domestic legal systems ought to be our protectors, who can find problem’s solvation and quite public fears.
In my opinion, the solution of reducing numbers of air travels can be obvious, but it seems unavailable to represent it. First of all, it’s impossible, because human population is still growing, and therefore more people need to travel and that tends to keep going. The international law community can solve problems of pollutions made by planes by making an international air location on each continent. That solvation not only reduce distances of travels, but also can save energy, recources to the companies. In addition, cost of tickets would also be reduced and that is why more residents from different regions could afford travelling by plane.
If the international community will not implement in their local law systems the document, it will be useless. – a Europinian  Union has got such an agreement and, according to statistic, amounts of air pollution tend to fall there.
In realities of Russia, nevertheless, the potential law to introduce can be to recieve more taxes from airplanes companies which do not meet the requirements. The companies will need to have airplanes which do not pollute atmosphere greatly. But, that law will be able to finish its goals not earlier than 50 years later.
To sum up, given possible sollutions, I would say that basically the reason of pollutions relates to law area less than to technological one and therefore we need to wait a little more before rapid development of air building industry.
