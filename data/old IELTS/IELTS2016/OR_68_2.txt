Nowadays, traveling by planes take a huge part in transportation people. There is an opinion that this kind of transport make involve significantly to air pollution and global warming, so these people suggest to create legislation for decreasing the number of air travels. On the other hand, the problem of air nature is not so clear and I believe there are another variants to solve the problem. In my personal oppinion I can not say that I agree or disagree with the topic but my position is near the party agree. It is true that the level of air pollution is extremely high that ace is malt and that governments all over the world and international organisations like WWF try to solve such a big problem. However, I am not sure that air traveling might cause this problem itself: increasing number of manufactures, fabrics and companies which have a “dirty” working process have the influence on air no more than planes. For example, city stations which boil water for houses produse extremely much of smog. Moreover, if we speak about transport that pollute our air we should not forget about automobiles, faries and so one. Furthermore, there are not garanteers that legislation about contributing traffic or air traveling would be working and everybody and every flight companies will follow the rules. So, I suggest to use more natural friendly oils for all kind of transport. In conclusion, I would like to say that there is not a true decision how solve the problem of pollution, but everybody may decide it by self.
