Nowadays a lot of people talk about the problems modern families face. One of them is spending too much time at work, so children are suffering from the lack of time, spent with parents. Why do parents spend less time with their kinds? What will it result in? First of all, parents have to earn more money to live a normal life. As the economic crisis strobe, companies are doing their best to survive, so the workers have to work more hours. However, the cost of living has increased, so that parents have to have not only 1 job, but even more. The third reason might be that people of the millenium generation are putting career goals forward, instead of having a normal family. Lack of interaction with parents might cause some illnesses in kids, such as depression. Moreover, they might suffer from some verbal problems, connected with the amount of chat they do with their parents. However, the worst problem will strike them in the future: they will not be able to perform the mother/father role properly because they will just not know how to do that. This will result in breakups and divorces rates among the adults of the most generation. All in all, the results of such a behaviour of parents might be disasterous for the future. Having all the money problems and your own career goals should more to the backstage once you have a kid. Spending time with kids is as important as going to school and learning how to read. Family is the first place the child get to socialise at, so parents should make sure to do their best in helping their kid with that.
