Nowadays international companies of developed countries aim to increase their incomes by moving their factories to developing countries. This process seems to be very productive and usefull or extravergent at the same time. That is why it has as advantages, as disadvantages. On the one hand, in developed countries companies have to pay more money to people because the level of life is higher than in poor countries. That is why it is cheaper to employ workers from developing countries, because they are ready to do the same work for the less salary. For example, many cloths brands design their model in the Europe, however the production in the Vietnam or China. That allows not only companies spend less money but also customers to buy not very expensive cloths. Besides, this process helps many people in poor countries to find a work and to have an opportunity to earn money. On the other hand, many companies move their business to poorer countries, because the cost of land is cheaper. Howver, there are a lot of “dirty”  factories there. They pollute  environment and do harm to local people. For example, many countries build their factories in Africa and this process leads to pollution of the land and people just cannot live in there area anymore. In addition, moving business to poorer countries can be expansive, because companies have to spend much money on the transport and to pay different fees. In conclusion, the main advantage of moving business to developing countries is that companies apply many workplaces for local people. However, this process can harm the nature of poorer country and make local people change their place of living because of pollution.
