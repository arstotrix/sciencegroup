Nowadays our planet is really polluted. Air travel, which causes air pollution even, makes a situation worse. I firmly believe that goverments should regulate the amount of air travel by laws,
To start with, in the modern world air travelling has become very popular and people have used to fly on the distances which are even less than 1000 km. In my opinion, travelling is not only visiting countries but also spending some time on the road (more than two hours). If governments introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for leisure, people will not travel less. They will use other means of transport and sometimes planes. In this case, people will broaden their horizons air pollution will be also reduced.
Moreover, there are many people who travel for business. it is really possible to control their business flights due to new laws. Today businessmen are able to make deals by using modern technologies and the do not need to fly to another country just to speak to another person.
There are some people who think that it is impossible to introduce laws in order to reduce air travelling. They are sure, that modern rapid lifestyle can not afford to spend much time on road. No doubt that is opinion is right, however, today we have trains and ships which are able to reach a very high speed. Besides, governments will only reduce the amount travel , not ban it.
To sum up, I believe that governments could introduce laws for reducing air travel. ALthough it will definetely reduce air pollution, the problem will not be solved. Therefore, governments should control not only the amount of air travel, but also do their best to invent eco planes.
