Crime is a very serious problem in many countries. Some people believe that the best way to stop this is to place people in prison for longer periods, others, however, think that there some other measures, which can be much more effective. Of course, there are reasonable causes to give longer sentence. First of all, there is an opportunity for prisoner to realize what he or she has done, analyze it and regret. Prison services will be able to rehabilitate and re-educate a prisoner. What is more, longer sentences may not only make prisoner regret, but also prevent them from commiting a new crime by teaching. However, some people argue that leaving in prison for a long period means that prisoners will not improve their character, while they live with other criminals. One alternative way is community service. This gives an offender the chance to make something good and positive for the society. Thus, they can improve their character. Furthermore, the government could focus on the causes of crime, which is very important to prevent future crimes. In my opinion, it is important to take into accaunt alternative methods because they are more pieceful and in many cases more efficient. Many prisoners after a long prisoned period cannot adapt to life and have to commit crimes again and again. Therefore, there should be either rehabilitation programs for prisoners who are sentenced for a long tome or an alternative for long prisoned sentence such as public works. In conclusion, there are good arguments for and against long sentences, so governments must continue to research different methods of punishments to make society safer.
