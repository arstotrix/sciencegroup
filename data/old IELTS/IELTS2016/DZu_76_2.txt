Air travel influences on air pollution and global warming. However, it is impossible to cut the all number of air travel for business trips and leisure by special law. From my point of view, it allows to solve a problem portly and produces other ones.
Air travel is one of the most populor kind of transport for moving on a long distance. There are a lot of benefits: time, comfort and others. Nevertheless, it has also some merits. One of them is air pollution and global warming. It governments make a law which reduce some air travels it can reduce air pollution because of gas emission would be cutted. Consequentle, the global warming process dicreased. However, air transport is not only a factor of pollution. There are also factories, cars, other human activity. Due to this fact, government ought to tackle with problem of air pollution in all sphares for successful result. In other words, if governments ignor factories, cars gas emission they cannot achieve good result.
Another fact of impossibility of reducing the amount of air travel is it will be hard for people to refuse from their trips by plans. Air travel is a successful toof for businessman, which overcome a long distoucto to just sign a contruct. The refusing can lead to some economical problems. Illness people also can suffer from eutting of air travelling. Sometimes, they are needed an urgent treatment on another world side.
In conclusion it should be said that the redusing of air travelling are not able to solve problems with air pollution and global warmings. A lot of people, their business, healthy depcud on how quikly they can overcome a long distance. Moreover, it is hard to distinguish necessary trips from unnecessory. Finaly, it can lead to problems in economics.
