In modern world, developed countries more their businesses to developing country for different reasons. It is fault of competition with other corporations, expensive taxes in own country and cheap manufacture in poorer countries. Firstly, competitions in developed countries, especially in megapolices, can play a significant role in making lecission of moving businesses to developed countries. For example, a new owner of bakery couldn’t develop his brend in his city, because there are a lot of other companies, specialized in bakery shops too. That’s why this young owner move his business in poorer country with other culture. As a result, his brend “bakery” in a new country, for example, in China, would be a fresh wind for the local residents, who eat in everydaylife, such, rice and sugar and so on. Secondly, high taxes in big cities in modern countries could be extremely high. If company spends lots of money on taxes, money from the business would be really unsignificant. International companies move their business to poorer country, where they could pay less taxes and salary for local workers. Finally, manufacture in the developed country could be extremely expensive. However, in the developed countries it would be cheaper, because owner of companies could employ local worker and pay them low salaries without giving long weekends and vacation. In this case, a high name of brend doesn’t bring for local workers good qualification high and salary but such manufacture is really convenient for owners. Moreover, moving business to developing countries can bring to decrease of quality of goods. To sum it up, advantages of such development are profitable for owners at companies but it cause a dangerous  effect for local workers, because lots international corporations try to carry only about their income. All in all, there are a big number of companies’ owners, who really think about their worker, but it’s another story and point of view.
