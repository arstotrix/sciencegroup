The pollution of the environment is a big problem, which humanity faces nowadays. There is also some climate changes that can be caused by human’s activity, and the air travelling is not an exception, so there must be some laws to control it, but it should not restrict the human rights. On the one hand, people have to care not only about their todays lives, but also to think about the future, which their children will face. The air pollution and global warming is happening nowadays due to the effect of people’s works. Therefore, the dangerous consequences are expected to finish down with the help of the nation. Thus, government as a controller is considered to make some efforts in order to prevent even worse potential disasters to come. What it can do is to simply implement some laws which will help to reduce the danger. On the other hand, people today really appreciate their rights and espessially the rights, which give them freedom, such as freedom of choice, freedom of expressions. These rights are strongly protected by the governments, and in this case new laws should not cancel the freedom people have, so if a person wants or has to travel by air for either business or leisure aims, he is expected to get this opportunity. To sum up, there will always be dramatic dangerous predictions, and humans are tended to overcome it in order to guarantee a safer life for future generations, but it is not supposed to be done by banning some freedom or interests of the modern nation.
