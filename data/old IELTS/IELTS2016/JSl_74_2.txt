Today there are a lot of  international companies who move their business to developing countries and employ local workers. On the hand there are several advantages to this point. Firstly, in poor countries local workers are much more cheaper, due to the low price for work international companies gain a huge profit. For instance, Samsung manufacture is located in China and its products, for example, mobile phones cost cheaper than the same mobile phones made in Korea. Secondly, companies allow themselves to double the amount of production. As much they produce as much they sail. As a consequence the company will catch a good place in the international market. On the other hand there are also several disadvantages that may outweigh the advantages. The first one is quality of product. The level of knowledge of local workers or their skills is not always as high as possible. To compare with international specialists the local workers skills are very poor. Due to it quality of production decrease. The second one is cargo. Retaining money on work will not retain them on cargo. It requires a huge amount of money and power to get a product to consumer. For example, the cost of D&G clothes than made in Chine is very low, although the prices we may see in markets are very high. To sum it up, I suppose disadvantages outweigh the disadvantages due to the final price. Employment of local workers and increasing production are very significant. Although the quality and cargo are the most important part.
