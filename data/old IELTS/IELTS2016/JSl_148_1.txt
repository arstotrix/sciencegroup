The graph given to us represents the information about changes in world’s investment in renewable energy since 2006 till 2013 in developing and developed country types and as a world total. As we can see, there is a correlation between speeds of development in both country types: they rise slightly between 2006 and 2009, then grow straightly reaching their peaks in 2011 and 2012and next fall down to the end of the period. Talking about some details, we should note that at the beginning of the given period developed countries invested three times more than developing: about 75$ bn to 25$ bn. By 2008 year this difference fall to two times more: approximately 110 invested by developed and about 55 – by developing. During nest three years there were not noticeable changes in percentage relation. In 2011 developed investments reached a peak of 280 $ bn in the next year developing – nearly 105$ bn, giving the next picture: by 2012 and 2013 years expencies of developing countries counted two thirds of developed spendings.
