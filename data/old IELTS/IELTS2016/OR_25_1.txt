The graph shows us the number of children who can not access to primary education. It can be seen that the amount of children who can not acces to primary education is reduced, from 2000 (43.7 million children) to 2012 (32.7 million children) in Africa. Not only in Africa but also in South Asia and the rest of world we can see ineredable progress. It can be seen that the amount of boys is small in every piece of world in comperrison with the amount of girls. To my mind this results are right, becouse in the whole world girls are learning and studying more than boys. To my mind the main couse of this is that boys need to go Army and after army a little amount of boys could continuing to learn and to study. As a result we can see that in the whole world the amount of children who access to primary education is realy slace down and it is incredible.
