  The criminality is one of the most significant problems of humanity. Every society tries to save itself from killers, robbers etc. There is an opinion that lawbreakers should be sentenced in prisons for a long time, because it can prevent crimes. However, some people who suppose there must be other solutions. The point of view that the society has no right to punish a man, even if he has committed a crime, is quite widespreaded. That does not mean that there should not be jails for those who broke the law. The only thing is that we do not punnish a criminal, but to prevent danger sentence him to the jail. It is evident, that just becoming a prisoner is not enough. Firstly, psychologists, social workers and other specialists have to give to the prisoner helping hand. And every psychologist would say that there is nothing good for one's behaviour in long sentences. Secondly, a sentenced person must not feel suffered from other members of society due to the fact it provokes the feeling of hate and agression in him. The expereince of the Norway's penitentiary system can be regarded as the best example how does it work, because in this country the percantage of people who committes crime again after the prison is very low. Finally, we see that this way of sentecing is an advantege for society. Nevertheless, many people see some drawbacks in it. They consider the criminal as the enemy of society, not their "brother" who has made a mistake. Such people understand the penitentiary system as "eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth" model of relationsheeps. Of course, it sounds logic, but simultaneously inhuman.   Thus, every country may choose what principals to choose and how to consider the criminal. We just should remember that our decision depict the level of пвддкыз of society
