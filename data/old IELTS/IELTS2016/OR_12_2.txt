As over more people stat to talk about air pollution and global warming, some persons argued that the amount of air travel should be reduced to keep out nature. I absolutely disagree with this statement. In my essay I will talk about different points of view surrounding that issue. I cannot follow the idea of reducing of air travels. Firstly, a lots of business processes depend on flights and some of them will not function as fast as they could be in case of reducing of air travels. Such situations may lead to economic and financial disoursters which are likely to be more dangerous for population. For instance, in case of unusual situation on stock market top management of investment banks will not be able to come to emergency conference very fast, what can have an awful consequences. Some people claim that such important percons can travel by car on blocked highways with traffic jams. Nevertheless, there is no transport faster than a jet. Secondly, these protectors of humanity should recall the fact that jets are the most safety transport that people have ever made. For instance, in countries with a small amount of flight people use other transport and because of that the statistics of depth during the traveling is worse then in other countries. It means that measures of reducing flight will not have a positive impact as it is supposed to have. At conclusion I would say that in contemporary world people need to have a lots of air travel as they develop very fast and the most fastest way of traveling must be exist.
