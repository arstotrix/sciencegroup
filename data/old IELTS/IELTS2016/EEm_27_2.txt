Today air travel can destroy our world because of air pollution and global warming but a lot of air travel is unnecessary and governments should show their own laws to travel by plane for business. A lot of air travel for business or leisure will be with laws.
First of all, we should say that air travel is the most popular way to travel. Moreover, it is the safiest way of travelling. So, all people know that air travel affect on the world negative but people do not want to change their safety on unsafety which can be illustrated by train travel. Nowdays flight companies have big money because of air travel and this companies are not interested in the air pollution. For example, scientists say that air pollution destroy the layers of our planet and if planes will fly often then more and more layer of the planet will be destroy. Governments and science should solve this problem because of global warming and dangerous situation.
Secondly, some people think that air travel is unnecessary and government should have laws for air travelling for business and leisure. I think that it is a right position because people should save planet which they create the big life. As for me, government should show ecological laws and ban air travel because now it is dangerous and then it can be critical problem. For example, on news we see that air travel not only dangerous for planet but and for peopleâ€™s life. Governments should be more careful and they should construct and create special rule for air travel and perhaps sometimes people find the best way of travel without planes and without gases.
In conclusion, we will see dangerous situation and global problem but countries should explan together and they should create one big text of the rules which will be based on laws and reduce air travel in the beginning. After that they can ban it and create something new without dangerous effects because once it can save the world.
