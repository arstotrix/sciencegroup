Nowdays there is an upward trend of rising of pollution level. Some scientists argue that one of the main reasons for this situation is air travel. I strongly believe that different governments ought to create some laws or programs in order to decline the number of air transport which is used for business and spending free time.
The first reason for such opinion is that there is a big diversity of transport such as car, bus, tube and so on. Moreover, they are much cheaper. Therefore, it is much more convenient to improve such transport and easy to carry out tests. So when countries have limits in using planes and other kinds of air transport, road models will be developed. Furthermore, there is a chance they will become more comfortable and people may have a desire to use them. Accordingly, government might emit less budget to these improvements because they are not so expensive compared with development of air transport.
Another cause why countries should reduce the quantity of air transport is a goal of decrease air pollution. Everyone can contribute this transport by others, it might be only not comfortable However, such way may decline some pollutions. For example, trains can be used. They do not exhaust so harmful fumes and elevate the amount of carbon monoxide in the air. Although it takes more time, it is more useful for the state of nature. Therefore, goverment ought to take into account this fact and introduce different programs in order to not aggravate the situation.
To sum up, there might be lots of advantages of using other kinds of transport eliminated air models. Therefore, new laws about this will be useful for improvements of state of different countries.
