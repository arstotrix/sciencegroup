 Bar charts demonstrate the modification in the spendings on the renewable energy made both by developed and developing countries in the period from 2006 to 2013. The line gragh illustrates the information about  the size of global funds in the same kind energy. The information about investment is given in billion of dollars.  It can be deduced from the graph that expenditure on renewable energy made by developed countries grows steadily during the whole period of time reaching its maximum in 2011 accounts for 180 billion of dollars. However, after reaching its all-time high the investment begins to decline to 120 billion of dollars in 2013. The figures of investment made by developing countries rises sharply from less then 50 billions in 2006 to aproximately 110 billions in 2012 demonstrating four-time increase.  The amount of global investment grows steadily from 2006 till 2008. Then expenditure remain constant only accounting for about 170 billions. After that the figure uncreases dramatically from 180 billions in 2009 to approximately 279 billions in 2011. Still, from 2011 till 2013 spending on such energy declines reaching only 214 billions.  All in all, developed countries invest more money in renewable energy than developing countries, even thouhg their investment increase stedily. After steady grow the global investment in the energy  also schows tendency to decline.
