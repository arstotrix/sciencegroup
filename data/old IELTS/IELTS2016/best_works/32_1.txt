The graph provided in the task illustrates how the percentage share of global smartphone profits changed during the period from 2010 to 2015.

As it is clear from the graph, the highest numbers are performed by Apple. From 2010 to 2012 the company's profits increased by 30%, from 40% to 70%. However, this increase has then followed by a drop in 2013, when the percentage reached the number of 60%. After the drop Apple recovered and demonstrated rocketing profits up to more than 90% in 2015. The main rival of Apple is Samsung: its profits also grew in 2010-2012 and reached the peak of approximately 40% in 2013 while Apple was experiencing hardships. Although in the period of 2013-2015 Samsung's share of profits decreased more than twice to the number of 15%. Two other companies mentioned - HTC and Blackberry - only demonstrated downward trends and insignificant fluctuations in the borders of 5% and 20%.

Summing up, Apple remains the strong leader in the market with more than 90% of profits share while other companies move to the bottom despite their efforts to perform upward tendencies.
