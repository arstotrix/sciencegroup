The bar chart below highlights how many children, both girls and boys, from different world regions did not have any potential ability to get basic school education in 2000 and in 2012.
It can be noticed that South Asia made the greatest improvement in providing children with education among all other regions. Not only the general number of illiterate children here decreased but also the boys and girlsâ€™ proportion significantly changed. Number of children without access to primary education in Africa fell too and that cannot be left without attention.
As it can be seen from the bar chart, there was only approximately 10 millions of children without the access to education in 2012 in South Asia in comparison to about 35 millions in 2000 which means that there used to be almost 3,5 more children unable to enter school in 2000 than 2012. According to the graph, there was approximately 4 times more girls without education which is just about 2 times more than boys in 2000 who did not have a right to have education.
Speaking about Africa, there was a slight improvement in decreasing the number of children with no access to primary schools: almost 5 millions more girls and just over 5 millions of boys were able to get education in 2012 results: the general number insignificantly decreased while boys and girls shares remained stable.
