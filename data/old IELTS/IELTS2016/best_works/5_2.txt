Nowadays there are lots of changes in the tendencies connected with family life. People start families later, then their parents to be sure they will be able to provide their children a bright future. But those who doesn’t postpone marriage and having kids sometimes has to spend less time with them. In this essay I’m going to understand this problem, find out it’s possible consequences and suggest a solution.
First of all let’s discuss the causes of the problem. Modern parents have the job as the top priority due to the fact that economic situation isn’t stable and people tend to obtain more wealth to be sure in their future. Parents should think not only about themselves, but about their children at the first place. Money required for a better kindergarden, a better school, teachers for sertain subjects and, finally, for higher education, which isn’t free in many countries. In addition there are primary needs such as food and cloths. Hence, people have to spend more time for and less for the other activities, including time with their kids. 
Nevertheless parents have only good intentions, their actions sometimes can be harmful for their offsprings. For instance, kids who suffer from the lack of the attention can be at risk of having a mental illness such as depression. Kids who are «by themselves» most of the time can suppose their parents don’t love them, while the truth is opposite.
The conclusion is simple: sometimes it’s better to spend time with your kid to understand, what he or she really needs, then pursue an aim of gaining wealth that you offspring may not need.
