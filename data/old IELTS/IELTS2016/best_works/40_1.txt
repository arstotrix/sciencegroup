The linear graph given above exhibits alterations in the percentage share of worldwide tablets profits during the period between 2010 and 2015. The main manufacturers in the diagramm are Apple (USA), Samsung (South Korea), Blackberry (Canada) and HTC from Taiwan.

In the beginning of the period Apple comprised approximately 40% of global smartphone profits, whereas the share of three other producers did not exceed even 20% for each. The share of Apple continued to soar in the following year and showed the growth of nearly 20 percentage points. As far as Apple's rivalries are concerned, their individual profits remained virtually stable, comparing with the previous year. Some prominent changes may be easily seen in the middle of the period as Samsung became second global smartphone manufacturer in terms of profits with 38% and 42% of the market share in 2012 and 2013 respectively. An interim fluctuation of the profit share of Apple occured in 2013, when the company gained 10 percentage points of the profit less than in 2012. As for 2014 and 2015, Apple has taken preponderance over Samsung because its profits have experienced an unprecedented increase, reaching slightly over 90% of the market profit by the end of the timeline. Conversely, Samsung's profits plummeted to initial figures. The percentage share of profits for Blackberry and HTC has declined by more than half by 2015.

To sum up, the structure of the market profit shares did not change as Apple managed to remain the leading company of the sector and even gained more profits by the end of the period.
