The chart provides information on the number of offsprings getting no primary education, distinguished by region and gender, in the years 2000-2012.
The general trend was clearly downwards, though the ratings varied notably between the regions and genders. The highest mark of the number of children without any primary education available was noticed in Africa with 20 millions of boys and 23,7 millions of girls, respectively, making for an insignificant difference between genders in 2000. The lowest rates of uneducated children were spotted in the “Rest of the World” region, with numbers twice as low as in Africa for the same periods of time. Both regions experienced a steady decrease of, approximately, 10 million adolescents over the period with the total of 33 millions and 15 millions for Africa and Rest of the World respectively. The most striking feature is the dynamics for the South Asia region. The number of children with no access to primary education fell dramatically from 33 to 10 million offsprings by the year 2012, which is an absolute minimum for the data given. Besides, the proportion changed greatly with the girls’ number twice as much as the boys’ in 2000 and almost the equal numbers in 2012.
All in all, it can be stated, that rates varied notably, enabling, however, to make out an obvious downward tendency.
