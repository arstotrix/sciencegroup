Nowadays the humanity try to solve more and more serious problems. One of them is a rapid growth of air pollution and global warming caused by increased number of travelling by air. There is a belief that the amount of air travel should be controlled and decreased by governments. As far as I concerned, I consider this idea to be irrelevant in today’s world for the following reasons.
To begin with, it is a very difficult to decide which air travels are necessary and which are not. It is almost impossible to create such organization or a law that will explain why this or that travel must be canceled. Introduction of this laws will probably cause negative moods in the socity. We cannot abandon all the leisure travels but if they are reduced everyone must have the same rights.
What is more, most of the business trips must be done as soon as possible. It usually has a great impact on peoples’ life conditions since a lot of projects and contracts are connected with humans’ difficult to mind of how a persons from the US and Japan for example will do their business without travelling between their countries.
Besides, from my point of view, problems caused by air travel must be dealt with. But it is up to the government to find a solution not in decreasing the number of flights but in improving technologies which reduce the consequences caused by a plane.
In conclusion, the problems of polluting the air and global warming still exist. Nevertheless, everyday air travelling strongly affects the humanity and the decision to decrease the amount of it will probably solve environmental problems but will cause more social issues.
