Nowadays air pollution and global warming are caused by many reasons including travelling by air. A big part of air travel is surplus, hence state powers should offer suggestions, for example, some laws which could help the situation and decrease number of flights.

As for me, I totally agree with this statement. I suppose the government should find alternatives to air travel and promote them. First of all, environmental problems are really serious in the modern world and aircrafts pollute the air with CO2 more than any other kind of vehicles. The active development of science afford us to use much quicker trains and sea-going vessels than before which are not so harmful for our nature. Secondly, the failure of Transaero, the Russian airline, was a consequence of real surplus at the market of air travel services. They thought that the development of the market was endless and increased number of planes. However, crisis and devaluation of a ruble lowered quantity of tourists and the market came to stagnation. Popularity of as international as hinterland directions decreased and it is the bright illustration that government can try to reduce the amount of air travel without strong resistance.

Nevertheless, some people think that air flights are the essential part of today's everyday life and it is impossible to reduce their number. But practice shows that only budget planes have full load in contrast to many aircrafts of business-class.

In conclusion, I would like to say that now is the best time for changes and helping our nature.
