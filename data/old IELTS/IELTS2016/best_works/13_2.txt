Environment pollution and global warming are one of the global problems we are facing today. As aircrafts are contributing to them, there is a suggestion that there should be a reduction of business and leisure air travelling. I totally disagree with that due a couple of reasons.
First of all, we should consider that air travel is the only way to get to distant places within a short period of time. Without it we won’t be able to get to, for example, Australia from Europe without spending weeks to do that. People will become nearly locked in their countries or even cities, if we are speaking about such large countries as Russia. The price on the small amount of tickets that will still be on the market will be too high and nearly noone will be able to afford them. As a result, we won’t travel that far, won’t discover our beautiful planet. As for businessmen, they will loose an ability to make international business as they used to, which will affect the global economy. Also, there are countries, which demand on tourists, but with reduced air travelling they won’t get their baxes, which will affect the level of life there.
Secondly, it’s important to remember that a great amount of pollution is caused by, for instance, cars and there are known ways to solve this problem. We can develop the sphere of electric vehicles, which have the same functionality as the petrol ones. but do not harm the environment. However, nowadays it’s impossible to find a substitute to airplanes, but it doesn’t mean that we should not use them.
To sum up, I don’t find it crutial to reduce the amount of travelling by air, as it will bring considerably bad consequences. We’d better take care of air environment by changing things that pollute it rather then banning or reducing them.
