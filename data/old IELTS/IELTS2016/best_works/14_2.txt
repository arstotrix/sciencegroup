Governments all over the world are thinking about reguling air travels to stop air pollution and global warming. People have different opinions on this problem.
I think that this idea is unnecessary at all. My opinion is that by air travelling people can live everywhere they want and stay in connect with other world. By air anyone can go to other part of the world in 10-15 hours. In the past this way could take much more time.
Als air travel does not need roads or railways. It need only two airports in place A and place B. This is cheaper to build an airport than many kilometers of road. And also I think that other types of transport is harmful too. And planes helps the world to be more open.
But not all people agree with this opinion. Some of them think that planes are very harmful. Planes fly all over the world and over North and South pole. This is one of the ideas why global warming is so big. Also planes pollute air and it is very bad too.
In conclusion I can say that all types os modern transprort are harmful. But planes have many good qualities. So the idea of reguling air transport is not very useful.
