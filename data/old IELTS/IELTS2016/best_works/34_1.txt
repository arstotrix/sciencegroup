The given bar chart reflects how much sport is done by various sex and age groups in England. As it can clearly be seen, among the covered groups of males and females from 16 to over 75 years old, the younger spend more time on exercising, however, getting older, more and more people tend to reduce training length or abandon sports at all.

To provide more detail, one can note that for both men and women the period of maximum time spent for physical activities is from 16 to 24 years, when human organism is at the apex of strength, fitness and development; at the same time, young people are less vulnerable to diseases that would stop them from doing sports or limit them to a certain degree. It is also notable that at this period men do more than twice more sports than women. For the following two age groups, however, this difference decreases, and, according to the chart, whilst women tend to do exercise for 92,8 minutes at average for almost twenty years, the number of minutes men from the next age groups spend significantly decreases from 282,1 minutes to 153,8 and then to 120 minutes. By the age at 64, as it can be observer on the chart, women prove to do even more sports than men. After this period, again, a rise in the average amount of time spent on training by men can be seen, and at 75 years, men devote time to sports in the same proportion to women as they did during the 16-24 year-old period.
