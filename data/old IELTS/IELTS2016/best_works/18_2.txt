Nowadays it is common for both parents to have a full-time job. Hence, children don’t receive as much attention as they used before.
There are some reasons why parents choose work instead of spending time with their child. First of all, if both parents have a job, it significantly increases the budget of the family. It allows them to spend more money on vital things for children such as good education. Secondly, women usually are eager to get back to their jobs and climbing career ladder after spending early years of child at home. In such cases parents usually leave their child to close relatives or to a private nanny. There is also an option when a child can stay in school or kinder garden until the evening.
However, leaving children and lowering the attention received by them from parents can lead to some significant problems, especially if it happens during early childhood. To start with, if the child is used to be very close to parents, such sudden lack of their attention can cause psycological problems. It is a hard chellange for a child to start spending some time without parents nearby. In addition, in case when parents don’t talk to their children often and are not interested in their concerns, children might build a strong opinion that parents don’t love them and don’t care about them. It can lead not only to broken relationship between parents and children in future but to many childhood fears and self-inconfidence as well.
In conclusion, it is an often situation when both parents go out to work. Sometimes they just don’t have a choice in order to provide the family with all needed goods and facilities. Although it is a normal situation, it should be done very carefully as such actions of parents can affect children roughly.
