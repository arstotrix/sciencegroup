The graph illustrates the amount of children who do not have the opportunity, to go to school in a period of time from the year 2000 to 2012 by sex and geographic location.
There is a general trend in all given countries including Africa and other states all over the world-girls tend to have less access to primary education than boys. So nearly 45 millions of children could not afford education in 2000 in Africa and more than half of that number is established by girls – 23,7 millions to 20 millions of boys. This proportion is even more in the South Asia in the same year – 21,6 millions girls compared with 11,1 millions of young men. In the rest of the world situation was the same in 2000 – 12,8 millions girls to 10,5 millions boys. The trend began to ruin by 2012. All selected countries changed the politics to gender factor. So, in South Asia and the rest of the world the proportion between uneducated boys and girls became almost the same at that time – 4,8 millions of girls to 5,1 millions boys and 7,6 millions of girls to 7,7 millions of boys. The only exception is Africa – the number of girls who don’t go to school because less but as in the past, boys tend to have more access to the educational programs.
All in all, we can see that the amount of uneducated children falls down each year and girls now have nearly the same opportunities for studying as boys do.
