Air travel is one of the most important reasons for such ecological problems as pollution and global warming. It is considered that the amount of air travel should be restricted by governments.

As for me I am firmly convinced that the amount of air travel should be reduced. Firstly, different gases and exhaust fumes released by planes cause air pollution. In its turn polluted air is hardly availiable for breathing. Moreover, it can worsen people's health. Secondly, these gases, heat and radiation result in greenhouse effect and global warming. It is not a secret that it can change our living conditions which are not suitable for organisms. In addition, some animals and plants will not survive. The last but not the least is that air travel makes a lot of noise and vibrations which are dangerous for ears.

Nevertheless, some people claim that nowadays people are very busy and air travel help them to be mobile because it is the fastest means of transport. Besides, it is very convinient, especially for people with children and who have some problems with long travelling. Though I do understand their opinion I belive that our environment is much more important than comfort.

To sum up I would like to note that air travel has to be reduced in order to improve ecological situation and first of all in the aim of government, because people are not consious enough and do not have enough power to make such serious decisions. The will have to obey the laws.
