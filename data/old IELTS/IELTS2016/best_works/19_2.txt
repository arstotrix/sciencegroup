National governments nowadays are seriously concerned about air travelling due to high levels of air pollution and effect called global warming, thatswhy they have to decide whether they should invent laws to decrease the number of flights or find another solvation.
On one hand, great amount of air travel is damaging nature every day, not only because they consume huge number of resources, such as fuel, oil, but also because of poisoned gas and waist thrown into the air. Moreover, some people say that air travel in many cases is unnecessary, because we have lots of other ways of transport. In addition, this type of travel cause serious and dangerous long-term outcomes, especially global warming, hence contemporary governments have to take measures to prevent future disasters and destruction of the nature.
On the other hand, introducing new laws to reduce the usage of air transport significantly seem to be too strict and not adequate to the situation, because it is still the fastest and the most comfortable way of moving from one place to another. Consequently, we have to focus not only on trying to decrease number of flights, using laws, but also on saving nature in general, taking actions against every source of pollution. Moreover, there are lots of alternative ways in solving problem of air pollution, except making laws: for example, finding new efficient sources of energy or improving air cleaning systems, or even making engines more efficient and less polluting. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that the best solution is to improve effectiveness of engines and to make the amount of gas thrown into the atmosphere fall down, until we find a new way of transportation, which would be faster, more comfortable and less damaging to our planet. To add, I think that appropriate option is to find a way to improve present transport, but not to get rid of it.
