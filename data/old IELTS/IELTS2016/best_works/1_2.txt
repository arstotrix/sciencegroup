There are different point of views on what the main functions of social networks are. While some says the social media should provide various types of information and improve knowledge of people in different spheres, the opinion that websites such as Facebook or Vkontakte were created only for entertainment also exists. I would rather agree with the first point of view.
First of all, social networks are good tools for education. They are open to everyone which means people can share their own knowledge with others, download some useful books and materials access to which is usually limited, discuss problems and find their solutions together. Interacting with other people, many of whom have a high level of intellect and a considerable amount of life experience, can give a person an opportunity to improve his own knowledge. Besides, exchange of opinions on the certain matter during discussions in social networks can help people to find mistakes in their theories and develop it.
Another important feature which should be taken into account is that Facebook and Vkontakte usually provide much more information about recent events than official news websites and, thus, are very useful those who want to find out more details.
Of course, it must not be forgotten that for most people social networks are only entertainment resources. Many of ordinary citizens claim that they discussed enough serious matters at work, and at home, sitting in front of the computer, they just want to relax. Nobody would denies that social networks provide a great range of games, movies and other types of entertainment. Still, I would argue that the main purpose of Facebook and Vkontakte is providing information as it is necessary for everyone to know about what is happening in the world.
Having said that, although. entertainment and sharing of knowledge are both very important functions of social media, the last one seems to be more important for modern people.
