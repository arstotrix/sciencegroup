The chart provides information about the amount of time dedicated by doing sport in England in 2012 by age and gender.
We can see the same tendency of decreasing time spent doing exercises with ages among both male and female. It is also important that men do more sport than women through the whole life, except a period from 55 to 64 years when the latter show slightly higher rate.
The greatest difference in rates can be noticed between 16-24 years-old men and 25-34 years-old men. In this case the time doing sport reduced drammatically from 282,1 to 153,8 minutes, while the decrease among the women of the same age group is just about 20 minutes. More or less equial rates among men and women are represented in the 55-64 age group.
It can be concluded from the chart that there is a deep correlation between the age and the amount of time spent doing sport.
