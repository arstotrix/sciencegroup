Although the news would have us believe otherwise, modern world is a rather safe place: the crime rates have never been lower than they are now. Still, as long as they are not zero, there is room for improvement. Indeed, there is a widespread belief that it would be most beneficial to give harsher punishments; others disagree.

Firstly, let us consider the purpose of prsion sentences. A common idea among proponents of longe jail times is that prison discourages criminals from conducting mischief in the first place. There is some truth to this; a rational person would definitely consider the cost-benifit ratio, and a harsher sentence would mean a higher cost, and so less crime.

However, this view assumes that lawbreakers always act rationally and have an alternative plan. It is well known that most murders, for example, are committed in the heat of the moment; the prison sentence hardly comes to mind of a person in such a situation. Street muggings, likewise, are a last resort of the desperate: even prison is better that living without food or shelter.

This brings us to the reason prisons are also called "correctional facilities". Their main purpose is rehabilitation, not vengeance. Would isolating a person from the outside world give them an opportunity to turn away from crime? Would it help them feel empathy for others? Clearly, the answer is no. Former inmates have a lot of trouble even finding a job that would accept them, leaving crime as their only way to survive. Compared to harsher sentences, a much better way of fixing that would be instating a basic income, improving mental care, and, most importantly, learning to forgive.

To sum it up, making the world safer is not as simple as throwing offenders behind the bars, only to be forgotten about. Behind every crime is a motive, and ignoring that won't do the society any good in the long run.
