The provided chart gives data on average time reserved for doing sporting activities by men and women in different age groups in 2012. It can be concluded that time spent doing sports generally decreases with age, and that men tend to spend more time on sports than women, with the only exception being age group of 55-64 where women dedicate slightly more time to sporting activities. The peak of sporting activity is observed in men aged 16-24, at nearly 300 minutes, while the smallest figure is found in women over 75 at only 10 minutes. However, men experience a rapid fall in sporting activity at ages 25-34, when the amount of time that is spent on sports is cut almost in half. On the other hand, the similar trend for women is not associated with such sharp decreases. Overall it can be observed from the chart that women are slightly less active but more consistent in doing sports.
