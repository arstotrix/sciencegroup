This bar chart illustrates the proportion of children of both genders from different regions of the world who do not have access to the education of primary school for years 2000 and 2012. Overall, the main striking feature of the chart is the increase in the number of children who can not get primary education in Africa and South Asia.

According to the chart, almost 24 and 20 millions of boys and girls in Africa did not have access to primary school education in 2000, whereas the number of children without primary education in South Asia was slightly more that 21 and 11 millions for girls and boys respectively in the same year. In contrast, in 2012 this number dropped a little in Africa by more than 5 million for girls and roughly 6 million for boys while in South Asia this number decreased considerably by approximately 17 million for the former and 6 million for the latter in 2012.

In comparison, the number of children without any access to primary education in the rest of the world was only 13 million among girls and 11 million among boys in 2000. Twelve years later this number declined by nearly 5 and 3 millions for girls and boys living in the rest of the world respectively.

In conclusion, it is evident from the bar chart that the number of children who can not get the primary school education is decreasing gradually in all regions.
