Nowadays every parent tends to work in order to provide a bright future for the child and for a whole family. The living costs much, especially in big cities, and the situation when both of the parents work is not a surprise. But even if the income of the family is high, the parents may work because of their ambitions. Let us see what are the consequences of such a lifestyle for a child.

At the one hand, a family where a woman is free to do what she wants, even work, is a happy and polite construct. But due to the necessity to earn a living and about building a carreer parents leave their child to grow on his own. Their care might be replaced with the nanny's work or grandparents care. They are not so strict (as a rule) and a child may spend a lot of time in front of the tv or computer screen, which is badly for health. Moreover, a kid is having a great self-orientation and weakly understands why his or her parents what him/her to help them. That is how the family ties break.

On the other hand, the absence of the parents participation in the child's life leads to the feeling of loneliness. As the children do not understand the morality they can create painful jokes about the kid that is grown up by a nanny or grandparents. These life situations are show in films such as "Home Alone" where the main character misses his parents a lot and they always work. He suffers from the weakness due to his ages and thus the movie stimulates young parents to think about their time-management more carefully.

To sum up, the main reasons why both of the parents work is the necessity to get money and a carreer willings. It might be resulted in a punishment from neighbours or in dangerous life experience, cause the little attention to the attitude of a child. The main problem is a feeling of the loneliness and the decreasing of a family's value.
