Today a lot of young families want to be finantialy independent so both parents refer work than to raise their children at home. 
Of course, it happens not because mother and father donâ€™t want to sit with their kids. The main reason is that prices for goods are high so it is necessary for families to have enough money to buy these products. It is obvious that everyone wants to live the full life and not only to get by with. Education of children is also expensive and parents always pay a lot of money for it. What is more, families want to travel on their holidays and go abroad at least once a year. 
It is clear that this kind of lifestyle causes some problems in fostering the children. Firstly, kids do not enough parents` attention, which can lead to psychological problems in the family because children can think that parents simply don`t love them. Secondly, this makes it hard to foster kids. Children spend a lot of time in, for example, kindergarden and take a wide range of habits from other children. Some children are bad behaviored so they can teach others to do the wrong things. And finally, the less time parents spend with children, the harder becomes for them to communicate with each other. It can cause different raws between parents and their kids. 
To sum up, parents in modern families spend less and less time with their children but going out to work is the only way to provide family with all necessary goods.
