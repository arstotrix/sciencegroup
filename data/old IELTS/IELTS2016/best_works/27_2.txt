Nowadays a lot of people argue about air travel. Some of them are sure that the amount of air travel should be reduced as it caused air pollution and global warming. However, others are claim that is not the most crucial problem.
I support the first point if view for a variety of reasons. First of all, air pollution, which is caused by the enormous amount of air travel, is the reason of global warming. A lot of countries are suffering from the consequences of it, trying to find the way to stop it. The problem is that the one country cannot deal with global warming alone. The all world should pay attention on how air travel is harmful for our planet. Moreover, people should think about the alternative ways of travel, which can be more harmless. Besides, scientists can create less harmful and polluted types of planes.
However, other people are sure that air travel is the least way of travelling. They claim that air travel is the fastest and the safest. There are more car accidents per year than the plane crashes. Also, they are strongly confident that it will be very expensive to create a new type off plane. They are sure that it is better to spend money on more important problems, like hunger and economical crisis.
I do not agree with this point of view because we cannot safe money on essential problems like global warming. People should try to help poorer countries to survive. I agree that the hunger is also one of the most crucial problems. But I am sure that it does not mean that people should forget about the others.
In conclusion, I am strongly confident that people should be very careful with the global problems as they influence not only our planet, but also the mankid.
