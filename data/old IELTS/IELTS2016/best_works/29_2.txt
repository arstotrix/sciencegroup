Air travel has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
It has already been concluded by scientists that aircraft produces too much CO2 emissions and destroys our environment. Some people would advice government to regulate the number of most popular flights to prevent the climate disaster. Others consider this idea useless and impossible and so do I.
First of all, after reducing the amount of business and touristic air travel any government will not be able to provide some transport instead and save the level of convinience. People will not be ready to sacrifice their time and comfort and, for example, travel 9 hours by train instead of flying for 1,5 hours.
Secondly, such suggestion would be a direct affact on the peopleâ€™s freedom and liberty. In modern society everyone has a right to move and travel to any place by any legal transport.
Thirdly, the regulation activities in the sphere of air travelling will lead to the decline in the level of economy. A lot of people working in the air companies and touristic field will loose their jobs because of the decrease in the demand.
All the things considered, I strongly believe that the reduce in the amount of some air travel will have more negative impact on people than positive impact on the environment. That is why I would suggest to support the science to solve the problem of pollution inventing new ecological technologies.
