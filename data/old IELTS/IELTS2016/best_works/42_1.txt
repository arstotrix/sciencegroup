The chart illustrates the number of boys and girls which did not have an access to primary school education in different regions in 2000 and in 2012. In general, it can be seen that the number of such children varies greatly.

In 2000 in Africa there was just below 45 million children without access to primary education and males made up nearly the half of them. In 2012 there was a decrease by 5% in amount of boys not visiting primary schools and the same trend was observed for girls. In south Asia more than 30 million of children did not have primary education and boys were the third of the total number. However, over the 10 year period this rate went down rapidly to the level of 10% for both genders. For the rest of the world the same changes were reported but they were not so significant with approximately 25 percent of children in 2000 and 15 percent in 2012 without great differences for genders.

Overall, the tendency of decrease in number of uneducated children is seen all over the world.
