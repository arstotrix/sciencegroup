The graph illustrates how the overall amount of children not able to get education in primary school and its ratio by genders in the three regions changed in 12 years. Overall, it is clear that there is a positive dynamic as the number of children without access to education has decreased.
Firstly, it should be noted that the inability to get education is not equal between boys and girls. The difference was the most clear in South Asia in 2000. It is also remarkable that the inequality became less defined within 12 years in this region as the numbers of girls and boys without access to education reached 4,8 and 5,1 million in 2012.
Furthermore, it is clear that Africa has the highest number of children not able to get education and the worst dynamic within 12 years among all the regions. The number has slightly decreased from 43,7 to 32,7 while remaining the highest in the world for 2012.
