The diagram below illustrates the number of children who don't have access to primary school from 2000 to 2012 and who are separated by gender and region.

In Africa the quantity of non-educated children was very high both in 2000 and 2012 years. During this period it had had a little decrease from 43,7 millions to 32,7. Part of girls was a bit more (23,7:20 in 2000 and 18,2:14,5 in 2012).

In the 2000 in South Asia number of children without primary education was also very high - 32,7 millions. Most of them were girls - 2/3 of all number. After 12 years situation has changed a lot and in the 2012 we can see equal quantity of boys and girls, total number was 9,9 millions.

In the Rest of World in the 2000 were 23,3 millions of such children and more girls than boys (12,8 with 10,5). In the 2012 total amoun became less (15,3) and part of boys and girls became equal.

In conclusion I would like to compare and summarise the result. In the 2000 Africa had the biggest amount of non-educated children and Rest of the World - the lowest. In the 2012 this amount in these regions decreased by nearly a quarter. On the contrary, situation in South Asia had changed a lot, the level in the 2012 became more than twice less than in the 2000. Part of girls in the 2000 was a bit higher than boys everywhere, but in the 2012. these parts became equal.
