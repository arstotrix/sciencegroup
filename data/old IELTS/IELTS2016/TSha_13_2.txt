Nowadays with the developing of women emancipation in some countries it is duscused that universities should accept equal amount of male and female students in each subject. Today, it is commonly believed that woman can do all work on the same level as men do or even better. Hovewer, I disagree with this point of view.
Firstly, the percentage of women in some faculty should depend on what type of work it is related to. It can be explained by the fact that there are a lot of “male” works nowadays. For instance, fire men should be strong, healthy and brave. No doubt that males have more facilities and skills for such kind of work. Moreover, men are more suitable for hard jobs like driver or builder of construction, because these works need extremely high level of concetration and a lot of strength.
Nevertheless, women nowadays can do more intellectual work than earlier. We can see a lot of succescful women in different sphere. They can be best doctors or even engineers. Furthermore women became even a head of large company or prime minister of government's ministries. In modern world in some countries females can became even a president of the country. It proves the idea that women can handle with hard intellectual works.
In conclusion, the number of male and female students should obviously depends on the subject which school graduaters is chosen. In some case, I suppose, it will be better to accept more males and in another more females. There are still jobs which suit only for women or only for men.
