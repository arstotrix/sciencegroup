The bar chart illustartes the information about investment in renewable energy in two types of countries in the 8-year-period between 2006 and 2013 years and the line graph gives an information about the total world situation in this area of business in the same period of time. The first noticeable thing is that the amount of money, invested in renewable energy, is bigger in developed countries. Also, we can see that investment in developed countries gradually growed, not including the slight fall in 2008 by 100$ for Bn, and reached peak at approximately 180$ for Bn in 2011, then fall down. Another situation in developing countries, where investment slowly grown up until the 2012, but also a little bit fall down in 2013. The line graph summarises the world total investment, so it copies the pattern of investment in developed countries, as they spend much more money.
