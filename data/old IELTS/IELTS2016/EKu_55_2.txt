Rising amount of crime during the last 15 years has become a serious reason for the government to start thinking about restricting prison sentences. Some people support the idea of making sentences longer; however, the others believe that there are alternative ways to make the punishment strict. On the one hand, by giving longer prison sentences, people, who have once thought of reducing a crime, will get frightened when seeing the conditions they may appear in if being caught by policemen. Second, there are reasons to suppose that the ones who are now out will try not to defy the law in case not to return back and spend there more time.    On the other hand, the government and security can try to eliminate the increasing number of theft and other crimes like vandalism by making people doing social works. Working out a certain punishment prisoners will also help. This way of behavior is less strict but it can be more affective. However, such kind of punishment is still appropriate only for “little” crimes. In condition when the person has committed a serious crime, he can be sent to work mines. There in extra conditions he will become organized. I partially agree with the statement above. In my point of view, any kind of punishment is relevant depending on the seriousness and the size of the crime.  Overall, the offer to provide with alternative ways can be taken, but I do not think that it can be better. Nothing is more tempers character better and more effective than estrangement. Nothing can be more effective and strict than renunciation.
