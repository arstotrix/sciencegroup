In the modern world there are a lot of companies, specialising in completely different sheres of life like health and beauty, food or clothes production or another one. Noticeably that many of company holders and presidents decide to change their business`s homeland and move it to less developed countries, where they attract local workers and provide them with salary. I personally see only benefits from this position for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is not a secret that so-called countries of the First World can help poorer ones become economically stronger and more developed by learning their popularity and society how to make a living. Having a business is not an exeption. People start working there, watching the process, solving problems and deals. Men and women can see that they can live in other conditions, have a good work-place with an appropriate amount of money provided. In the result, the common attitude towards a lifestyle changes or turns to another side, showing opening horizins and opportinities. Secondly, not only workers, but also the employees gain profits by spending less money on the whole production, because in the developing countries prices for work are far less than in they motherland. In that case company use its income also to maintain some other things that are too important as worker`s salaries.  In addition, it is considered to believe that several developing countries are more good at some certain spheres like India in clothing production. That means that companies push their limits to improve its own skills how to make a product. Nowadays, thit kind of cooperation leads to effective and impressive results. In couclusion, it can be said that the decision depends on the company`s keeper only. Some presidents see benefits in this path, other are less positive, but it is highly necessary to give poorer countries a chance to grow up and aspire their potentional.
