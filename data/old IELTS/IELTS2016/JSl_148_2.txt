There are a lot of international companies that help to employ workers in developing countries by moving their businesses to them, in modern world. As for me, such kind of help has as its own advantages as disadvantages. On the one hand, this development can really support poorer countries. Firstly, more and more people become employed that, secondly, rises standards of living and, therefore, makes this country’s economy function better and improve. Also this innovation can affect on other people’s desire to live in this country because it has become more perspective and better for living.  As for businessmen themselves it is a brilliant kind of marketing, especially PR, because they support those who need it, simply giving it to them in their country. It is important to note that the majority of people in poor countries can not afford themselves to live somewhere else abroad. On the other hand, there can appear some complications because of moving business abroad. The former thing is that there are always cultural differences between different nations, therefore it would be important to take into a count some cultural aspects such as not bringing a brand with some unpleasant symbols or words even. The former thing is competition. If particular company with a particular business direction took place somewhere in Africa, some African starting businessman would not have an opportunity to develop because his company  would end up badly, competing with an international company. To sum up, I would like to say that moving international business seems a really successful idea as for business helders and as for country-recipient, having more advantages than disadvantages.
