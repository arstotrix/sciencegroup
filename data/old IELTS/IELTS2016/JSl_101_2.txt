There are ongoing debates about whether it is more successful to set up business in the countries with developed level of developing one. In recent times there is a tendency between overseas corporations to dislocate their companies to poorer countries. This essay will determine pros and cons of this phenomenon. What about advantages, developing countries can afford companies plenty of employees. The workforce is an imperative resource for businessmen nowadays. Secondly, poor countries apply a large amount of opportunities for opening business because they do not have so much fertility of goods and services of developed countries do. Furthermore, in return international companies may act as catalyst for development for these countries. Also new working opportunities will finish unemployment and eliminate poverty in these regions. This can be proved by saying that the more places to work the less people’s need in money. As for disadvantages are concerned, international corporations moving to poor countries will lead to the process of urbanization and, thus, will cause environmental pollution. What is more, overseas companies may lose their high-qualified and skilled workers due to the fact that moving to a worse country is not desirable for them. To conclude, I would like to argue that it is generally accepted that modern society needs to make steps for improving living conditions in developing countries. It seems to me that international business’s dislocation to these areas in there regions.
