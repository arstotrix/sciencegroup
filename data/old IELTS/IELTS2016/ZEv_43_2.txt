Nowadays airplanes become more and more popular as the fastest way to travel long distances. However, there is a great discussion on the theme of air polution. Some people believe that air travel has no effect on the condition of our atmosphere while others are absolutely sure about strong negative effects of this type of travelling and vote for prohibiting wide usage of planes for business and holiday trips. As for me, I partly agree with the former opinion.

First of all, planes are not the worst kind of transport in terms of polution. Cars and motocycles produce much more fumes in total which destroys our atmosphere and lead to global warming. That is just about counting. If we imagine that every passanger on the board has his own car, the amout of toxic gases which would be produced by their cars would be enormous and the level of air polution would be many times higher.

Secondly, the height which is used for flights is above that height which has an impact on our life. The air we breathe is 40000 km below the air which is polluted by planes, if it is.
 
On the other hand, there is no need to mention, that the condition of our environment is crusial today. Governments should pay attention to all aspects of this problem, especially when it touches air pollution. Of course, there are much more other troublemakers, for instance, cars and factories. But if planes cause air pollution, even if less than other transport â€“ it is worth solving this problem from the side of air travel, too.

In conclusion, I would like to say, that governments should introduce laws protecting our environment from pollution with no doubts. However, the part of air pollution caused by airplanes is not so significant. Therefore, our government should struggle with the great amoung of car explosion and other more critical causes of air pollution first.
