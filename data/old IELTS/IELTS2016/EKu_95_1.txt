 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The two graphes illustrates how many people used Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and why men and women used it. In the first chart the information is given in millions and in the second chart the infornation is given in percentages.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It can be deduced from the first graph that the use of Facebook on Desktop decreased during the period under discussion from approxomately 150 millions of users in 2012 to 130 millions of users in 2013. Speaking about the use of Facebook on mobile, it increased dramatically showing practically a two time grouth from 50 millions of users in 2012 to 95 millions of users in 2013.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The second chart demonstrates that 54 % of women claimed that the main reason for using Facebook was the opportunity of sharing photos or videos, so it can be stated that it was the most popular and important option for this category. For men it was as important as receiving updates because the same amount of percentage (39 %) called both of these opportunities the main reason of using Facebook. Similarly, 39 % of women answered that receiving updates was the main reason. Speaking about seeing funny posts, it was more significant for women than for men. The least important opportunity for both categories was learning about ways to help others because only 35% of women and 25% of men said that it was the min reason of using Facebook.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, after analysing the information given it can be stated that the use of Facebook on mobile increased, while the using on Desktop declined during the period under discussion. The most popular reason for using Facebook was sharing photos or videos for both categories and for men receiving updates was important too.
