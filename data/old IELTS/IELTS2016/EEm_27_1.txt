The chart shows us changes of children who do not have access to primary education. The chart based on region and gender.
First of all, we will see that Africa has extremely high numbers of children without access to primary region. On the second place we can note rest of the world and South Asia> Moreover, South Asia has bigger numbers than rest of the world.
Secondly we can see that number of girls bigger than number of boys except South Asia and rest of the world. In addition, numbers in 2000 say to us that level of education was so low early. After 12 years people intergated many technologies for educationâ€™s improvement and the number of children getting low. As for me, I think that this number with decrease and the education will be more effectivly and than each person can get the primary education.
Finally, I repeat that numbers will be decrease and all children can get the primary education without problems. People should improve their education and they do that every year and government should help people who cannot get the primary education.
