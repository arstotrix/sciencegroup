The bar chart clearly demonstrates dynamic changes in having access to primary school education by children (boys and girls: numbers in millions) in different geographical regions (South Asia, Africa and Rest of World) in period of 2000-2012.
It could be mentioned that the main tendency in children’s access to primary education is not so optimistic one. Whatever region it is there is a decrease in ability to be primary educated. For instance, almost 43 millions of African children had enourmous possibilities to go to school in 2000, while this number reduced in 2012 (only 32-33 millions). Nevertheless, the huge fall in education access statistics is revealed in South Asia, where this number triply lessened (33 millions of children in 2000 against 10 millions in the of the period researched).
The diagram also reflects the difference in access to primary education (males and females). For example, The dominance girls’ access took place in South Asia in 2000 (doubled difference: 21,6 millions of girls in comparison with 11,6 millions of boys). However, the rest changes are not so complicated and dissimilar.
To conclude, in Rest of World region children have pretty equal possibilities to go to primary school, while in Africa and South Asia the situation develops in another way. The whole children’s access to primary education from 2000 to 2012 decreased.
