The bar chart provides information about the number of children without any access to primary education for twelve-years period by region and gender. As we can see, the x-axis illustrates regions, when y-axis shows number of children. The highest number of children (more than 43 millions), without any access to primary education was in Africa in 2000. Also there is the smalles bar with the total number of such children about 10 millions, but in South Asia and only twelve years later. By all statistic which we can see, the number of children without access to primary education is different, and it changed in every country also in different way. In Africa for twelve-years period this number stay smaller only from 43 millions to 32. When in South Asia we can see a large contract between such numbers in 2000 and 2000, from 32 millions to 10! Talking about the Rest of World, here the number has always been larger than in other regions.
