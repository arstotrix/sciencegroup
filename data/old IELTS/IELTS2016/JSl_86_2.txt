Nowadays a lot of international companies lead their businesses to developing countries and give jobs to local workers, I suppose that the positive side of such development overtake the negative effects and there are several evidences for that. First of all, such movement helps developing countries raise their life level by building new factories and offices with the help of foreign investment. For example, if some famous company like Nike build its factory in developing country in Africa it leads to many work places for poor citizens and gives the government an opportunity to make lives of its people better. Second, this development increase the level of economies in developing countries. New jobs mean new specialists and professions that can give countries a chance to teach professionals and to send them abroad for studying in international companies. Moreover, opening new offices of companies in developing countries can make influence on the level of education because most children in poorer countries take not a good education so this development can give them to study for working on factories and take a better education. International companies can open some vacations and send teachers to universities to teach for these special jobs and it will solve the problem of unemployment. On the other hand, opening international offices can cause a bad effect on local companies because they will not be at the same level of quality. This disadvantage may change the view of developing countries where there is no place for national companies. All in all, I truly believe that the advantages of opening international businesses on developing countries outweigh the disadvantages because if national companies provide high â€“ quality products there will be no problem with national business. Moreover, more companies give more vacations that leads to decreasing of unemployment.
