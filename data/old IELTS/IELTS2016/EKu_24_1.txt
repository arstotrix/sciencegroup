In this report I will describe the charts showing the changes in the use of the Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and the main reasons for using it among men and women. First, I will describe the bar chart that shows changes in the use of the Facebook from March 2012 to March 2013 (both desktop and mobile versions). The desktop version of the site is overall more popular with users than the mobile version, with the number of desktop Facebook users being higher than 100 billions, and the number of mobile Facebook users less than 100 billions. As for the changes, the number of desktop users have decreased slightly from approximately 150 billions to less than 140 billions, while the numbers of mobile Facebook users have increased from less than 60 billions to almost 100 billions. The second chart shows the main reasons for using Facebook in percentage among men and women. Sharing photos/videos seems to be the main reason for both women and men, with the numbers of 54% and 39% respectively. Another reason for women is seeing funny posts (43%, while for men it is only 35%), and for men it is receiving updates- 39% (the same figure for women). The least important reason for both women and men turned out to be learning about ways to help others, with numbers of 35% and 25% respectively. This ends my report.
