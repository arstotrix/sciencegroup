There is an opinion that government should to restrict air travelling to protect the environment from air pollution and global warning, because it is a well known fact that the airplanes have negative influence on these factors. If you want my opinion - I totally disagree with such point of view.
Firstly, the reducing of number of flights will make life of people more difficult and inconvenient. People travel by plane everyday and their aims to do it quite various: It is clear that there are a lot of travels just to get rest or just for fun, however there can be very significant and important events, which men shouldn’t miss. For example, it can be connected with family, health or work. In any way, the decision to reduce airflights will distinct the personal life of humans.
Secondly, travelling by plane are often used by businessmen, who need to solve their problems rapidly. If government restrict the amount of air travelling, businessmen will lose a lot of money, because of the unability to meet with their partners and other important people. In this way, such decision of governments will badly effect on the business life.
Finally, I think that the negative influence of airplanes on the environment is not the problem of people, who use this way of traveling. To my mind it is the problem of inventors and constructors of these planes, because they should pay more attention to the systems, which should totally decrease the bad influense of this kind of transport. So, government need to ask them to improve the planes in order to not to restrict the number of flights.
To sum up, I don’t agree with the reducing of number of air travels, because the main reason of pollution is not the amount of travelling, but the construction of the air transport. In addition, the life of people will become more uncomfortable and difficult if the government takes this decision.
