The chart illustrates how the number of boys and girls in millions who have no access to primary school over the period from 2000 to 2012 changed by region.
First of all, we nee to highlight that the region with the biggest number of children who could not attend school in 2000 is Africa. The amount strarts off with 43,7 and decreases to 32,7 by 2012. That is the exact number of uneducated boys and girls in South Asia in 2000. Later it was reduced to the lowest level (just 9,9 millions) among all the regions in 2012. Moreover, the rest of the World had the least number of children without access to primary school in 2000, which is just 13,2 millions. The approval over the period was not as impressive as in South Asia though. It decreased by 7,9 and reached the level of 15,3 millions to 2012.
In terms of gender, I’d like to highlight that there has been less girls than boys who didn’t go to primary school only once. That was in South Asia 2012. Nevertheless, there has always been more uneducated girls than boys in Africa and the rest of the World.
Overall, there had become more educated children by 2012 in all the regions, although the amounts are not at the same level.
