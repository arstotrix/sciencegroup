 It is believed that airplanes have a great meaning to the Earth, cause air  pollution and warming and that the goverment should give more laws to avoid increasing popularity of our travel - I absolutly disagree with this idea.
 First of akk, airplanes are one of the most safaly transport in the world, it's comfortable way to travel todifferent countries and countinents. These are a lot of other dangerous kinds of transport (like cars, for example) which have prove to contribute greatly to pollution and which, in the same ways, are dangerous for people. I think that the goverments should draw attention to that kinds of travel, besides, air travel is more pleasure king to travel because people can not distruct nature, like they can do it in a car on the road or the forest. By the way, the air travel is the fastest transport and in spite of this fact airplanes take less oil then different transport (in persentage of couse).
 So, I'm sure that people should take care of the Earth, solvens the problems of water and air pollutions and problem of global warming, but I absolutely disagree that for this people should avoid air transport. I think goverments able to draw attention to other activities of the people (may be like heavy industry) which can lead to different pollutions and other problems to nature.
