Nowadays some experts argue that universities have to keep a balance of male and female students in every subject. However, there are people who do not support this idea. Let us consider this problem.
In my opinion, universities should not follow the idea of accepting equal numbers of male and female students. To begin with, in modern world in proffesional area people do not have Features of having ecpecia sex. That means that in Universities study students and people should not ceparate them according to their sexes. Moreover, it could be difficult to realise it because an inequal quantity of men and women is essential for the real life. Finally, in certain regions stereotypes made some proffesions only one sex-oriented. In this way, univeisities can not set equal numbers of male and female students because of formed lraditions there.
However, there are people who think differenlty. They argue that setting equal numbers of boys and girls in each subject is necessary. These people claim that introduction of this rule make process of studying more pleasant and sensible. They also suppose that it helps students to got used to the conditions which they get after graduation. I do not agree with them. I personally think that historically men and women have different living purposes and they do not have the same needs in graduating. So that accepting the equal numbers of male and female students is not a successful idea.
To sum up, different people may have their own unique point of view. But I think that accepting this idea will not not bring efficient benefits to society.
