Nowadays in a lot of universities there is a wish to enter the new rule, which includes that the amounts of girls and boys must be equaled. I will consider this statement from 3 points of view: hystorical, biologyeconomical and own.
According to the hystorical viewpoint let's remember the past. In many countries a lot of people tried to equal the rights of each gender, individ. Many heroes died to remain this principle. Comparing with this fact the government of universities wants to destroy it.  It can affect on the students, society in general. It is the example of the discrimination. The main feature of this consists of the negative results to everyone.
If we want to conduct a comparison between the previous point of view and biologyeconomical, conclusion will be remained. The costs on the female students are more than on the male. This fact establishes with the anatomical characteristics of the female organysm. It accords to the situation in which number of male students will more than female.
From my point of view universities, if they haven't got the popularity, can't accept equal numbers in every subject, because in maths and physics the appropriate student is the male and in humanitary sciences the girl is more suitable than boy.
To conclude my essay I'd like to say that I disagree with the universities and I hope that they understand that is the mistake for them.
