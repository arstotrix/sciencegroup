There is no doubt that using of modern technologies influences the environment significantly and air travelling is not an exception. In this situation governments and society should not ignore the problems, connected with it, trying to coordinate efforts for searching a solution. Ecological problems, linked with air travelling, must be publicaly discussed. It is necessary to provide people with information about dangers and disasters, which threaten our planet due to mass using of aircrafts. At the same time, it is wrong to exclude the social value of air travelling. It is necessary for quick transporting of sick people, delivering medicines, goods, equipment to some regions of the world, where people need help. Moreover, it is hard to imagine modern economical development without widespread aircraft system and constant air travelling. Probably, the most effective solution of this problem is not legal restriction or reducing of air travelling, but using of environmentally-friendly fuel and materials for contrasting planes. To conclude, I would like to note that it seems to be impossible to decrease the level of air travels or fully deny from them in a modern world, but governments and society should try to get compromise and take measures for saving the environment from negative influence of human activity. Each of us should think about now will Earth look like by the time, when next generations will grow up, and try to be responsible for the consequences of our public and personal activity, search the right, safe ways for realization of our needs.
