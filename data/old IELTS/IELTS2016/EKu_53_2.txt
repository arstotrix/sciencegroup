The fact that a lot of international companies develop their businesses in developing and poor countries and employ people who live there is rather urgent nowadays. There are both advantages and disadvantages in such kind of approach. There are several advantages of such way of developing a business. First of all, it is the cheap working force. The labour of local people can be paid less because in much cases the level of unemployment is very high in poor countries, so those people do not have a choise what kind of work to do. Another thing is that the costs for renting a place in poorer countries is much lower than in developed, so it is profitable for international companies to move their business in such zones. Such a situation now is in South-East Asia where much of departments if international countries are located. Surely, all these advantages make the product's cost lower than in would be in more developed countries. Of course, there are some disadvantages. One of them is that the companies often do not think about the enviromental problems of poorer countries. The factories belonging to international companies pollute the area because the governments of these countries do not control the level of polluting the enviroment. So, the Earth really suffers from it. Another disadvantage is that the company often cannot control the businesses in poorer countries because of the long distances between the main office and the departments. To conclude, there are both advantages and disadvantages in the strategy of moving their business to poorer countries. Although for companies those advantages are really important, they should not forget about the interests of local people. And, of course, the governments should control whether such companies observe the law of this country.Â
