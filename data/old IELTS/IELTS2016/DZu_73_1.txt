This chart illustates changes in the number of children without access to primary school education from 2000 to 2012 by gender and region.
We can clearly see the main trend of falling number of children without access to primary education both for Africa and South Asia. But as for South Asia, the fall of this number is bigger than it is at the same period in Africa. In South Asia we can indicate that number of children has felt from over 33 millions of children to 10 millions, but in Africa the number has felt only from over 44 millions to 33 millions. This fact also shows that Africa has the same number of children without access to primary education in 2012 as South Asia had in 2000, so it can be concludied, that Africa has a low level of education as South Asia has.
We can also see that in most diagrams the number of girls without access to primary education is higher than number of boys. But in South Asia in 2012 it is another trend â€“ the number of boys is higher. As conclusion, we can see, that this trend leads to the same at rest of World.
