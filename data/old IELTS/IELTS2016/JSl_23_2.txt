It is quite common to have different points of view on various problems. “So many men, so many minds” as the saying goes. Some people think that air travel has bad influence on our atmosphere. Others believe that people must traveling by air and it very important to use such things. I think that air travel very important to transport people between different countries. And I tidy understand author’s point at view and I like them. Air plane pollute air and global warming is the reason at air travel. I consider that governments should calculate the amount of air travel for business and leisure which will help in the future introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel. At last ten years scientists have working on governments different contries. They want to recognize variant air travel  without using fluel which pollute air and atmosphere. Such type of airplane will work on natural products, may be it will sun energy or water energy or it will work electrities. May people could say that air transport has very bad influence on our environment and in the future our children will suffer from our air travel. I like this position and I believe that our air scientis will have the idea to travel without pollution. In conclusion, I want to say that every point of view is justified, but truly believe that air travel for business and leisure we must decrease. Governments differend contries should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel business and leisure.
