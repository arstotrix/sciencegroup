Although the contemporary century of new technologies and high speeds includes necessity of kinds of transport, their constantly increasing number can become a reason for air and water pollution and global warming. Because of it, one of the greatest question nowadays is problem of decreasing harm from transport without its destroying.
Air travel is one of the fastest and most comfortable way to arrive at almost every place. However, air transport has also negative influence on the environment. And without doubt, because of impossibilyty of changing something in construction of airplanes and constant necessity in this kind of travel, there is an opinion, that considered the best solution of government could be reducing business and leisure trips. In my opinion, it could not be possible in modern reality. Firstly, prohibitance of using airplanes would make people develop car and train industry, which have got such an amount of waste into the air and water. It could not help to solve problems with pollution.
Secondly, it would be harmful for world speeds and could almost stop the professional and business activity.
