The following bar chart illustrates how investment in renewable energy in developed and developing countries changes in the period of seven years (from 2006 to 2013 respectively) and the line graph above the bar chart represents changes of a world total investment of the same period of time. As can be seen from the given chart, developed countries invested more resources in renewable energy than developing countries every past year. The highest point can be noticed in 2011, when developed countries spent approximately 170 dollars on energy, whereas developing countries gave only 100 dollars this year.
