Today, a great number of air travel is made that impacts on our environment and causes air pollution and global warming. Therefore, governments should introduce laws, in order to decline the amount of travel by air for such reasons as business and entertainment. I somewhat agree with this statement.
To begin with, plane is one of the most popular way of travelling that requires burning a large number of fuel. These emissions impact on atmosphere causing such dangerous consequences as greenhouse effects, acid rain and especially, global warming. Thatâ€™is why, governments should all their best to prevent this disaster. Besides, ecological problems, which are caused by using plane, influence healths of people. Moreover, modern citizens often suffer from such sicknesses as, oncological illnesses, migraines and many others. Some decades ago, the number of illed people was significantly lower.
In addition, these environmental issues are able to change the climate. This is really a serious problem because every region of our planet get used to own weather conditions. For example, people in Africa can not cope with snow, or Siberian citizens can not live in high temperature climate.
However, air travel is one of the most faster and comfortable way for travelling. Thanks to planes, it is posible to get to the other corner of the planet for some hours, while you have to spend significantly more time to travel by bus or train. Besides, travel by air is one of the most safe way of moving because you can not get to the accident.
To conclude, I would like to say, I somewhat agree that although plane is fast, comfortable and safe mean of transport, it causes serious ecological problems which can destroy our planet and effect on our health so government schould introduce laws to reduce mount of air travel.
