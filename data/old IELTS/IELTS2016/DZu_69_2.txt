In this essay I should state my opinion about legislative regulations on business and leisure airtravel due to the increasing air pollution. To be quite frank, Iam partly agree with the following statement.
There is no doubt that the incresing number of air travel and travel in general is one of the core factors, which are responsible for the pollution of our environment. If we see air travel as the hain threat to our biosphere, which is partially true, we may agree with the governmnet’s desire to use it’s legislative power for reducing amount of air travel. As far as I remember the facts, which I learned in Elementary school, the hull of plane, fuel waste, toxic waste, plastic products – everything that I have listes is something that is completely immune to time. Nature can’t recycle theese materials and components. If Iam not mistaken, it takes 500 years to recycle alluminium for Nature. In terms of possible disaster, legislative controll is nessesary.
But, as a future lawyer, I a, strongly against non-productivs and hysterical of legislative power of a state. If the problem can be solved without introducing laws, that prohibit or ban something, its better not to do it. I am completely sure, that this very problem can be solved just like the problem with cars. Government innovated standarts for car engines, like Euro Standart. If Governments instead of reducing, just create a system of standarts, that would be way more productive. And one of the worst results of pollution – global warming – will disappear.
If to sum everything up and draw a conclusion, I would say that I am partuelly agree with the original statement. We can’t mannage a decent life for our children without consideration of fact, that we are responsible for our environment. But there is no reason to use legislative mechanism at full force. There is no need of strict prohibition, but there is need of soft regulation.
