Today there is a tendency to change the location of international companies and set them in poor and badly developed countries, using their citizens as employees. This issue has many pros and contras so that there can not be any common characteristics. On the one hand, moving developed businesses to undeveloped places, of course, leads to renewing and making this places better, because local livers get the job, have a salary, take care of their families and just rise the living level of their country. Moreover, due to placing international companies on different countries, businessmen provide international integration which develops the relations between people from different soceities and with different cultures. On the other hand, this integration can not always work. In this case it will cause different intergroup conflicts. For instance, a sit was in Uganda several years ago. Famous American company of human resources research founded a very big, laboratory in Uganda and after employing local citizens to their owners understood how difficult it is to assimilate with Africans and work for common goals with them.  Hired people just didnâ€™t get the rules and conditions of Africans, what held to a very big riot and following liquidation of the laboratory in Uganda. Overall, in my point of view international companies should place their businesses in poor countries as it develops the relations between difference countries. Perhaps, not any country is appropriate for this, so companies should precisely choose where to move. It will cause less troubles and businessmen will avoid conflicts.
