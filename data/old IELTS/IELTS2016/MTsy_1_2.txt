Nowaday, the problem of finding of apropriate solytions to reduce air pollution and to solve the problem of global wrming is so actual. The goverment suggests to reduce the amount of air travel. Does it worth it? Lets us think both sides of this question.
On the one hand, the air transport is the fastest type of transportation. It takes a few hours or even minutes to come places of destination, which are a far miles away. Moreover, it is the safetiest transport. Another kind of transport, for example cars, are much more dangerous than airplanes. According to statistics everyday in the world happen more than 100 car acsidents, which lead to an increase of air pollution. To follow this theme, other type of transportation produce pollution too. Possible, in the complex this kind much more dangerous for the inveroments, than airplane. these are worth attention of the government.
On the other hand, air transport is the most expensive of all. It is built of the alluminius, which is a waste. In addition if consume a lot of fossil fuils and money for repairing and constraction., This costs can be use in more useful areas, such as education.
To sum it up, government should provide a complex of programmes for reducing an air pollution and to begin with the lond type of transportation. They should invest in science, especially, in project for replaces the traditional veichecles by eco transport, and to encourage people to use bicycle.
