Air travel is one of the most popular and safe way of travelling. Due to the fact, that air transport is the fastest one, millions of people prefer it to other ones wherever they go. However, as the plans use a petrol, they cause air polution. This fact have became an argument of scientists, who are struggling with the air transport as a factor of global warming. Plans need a lot of engine to fly, and they burn a lot of petrol to produce such engine. In the result they put huge amount of Carbon Dioxcide into the atmosphere, which can provide a global warming in the recent future. As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, our government should create some ways to reduce a number of such travels by introducing special laws. For instance, getting higher taxes for flights will make ticket prices more expensive and some of travelers will prefer plans to other types of transport, such as trains or busses. On the other hand, the biggest part of nowaday’s transport produce as much CO2 as the plans, which makes such measures of struggling with air pollution as reducing number of air flights, not so efficient. If people would prefer to travel by busses, it will cause increasing number of bus travels, which could produce much more CO2 then even plans in the recent future. Eco-transport can solve such problem, but at the moment, the level of technical progress is not on the necessary level to bring such measures into reality. Summarizing all the fact said before, I should agree that nowaday’s transport and pollution it provides are the greatest problems of modern world, and it is worth struggling with them. Doubtless, that air travel is one of the factors of global warming, but not the major one, and if we want to win this fight, we should get a great complex of measures to create a type of a transport, which doesn’t pollute our atmosphere.
