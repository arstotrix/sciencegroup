Nowadays people often use plains like ordinary mean of transport which considerably pollutes the atmosphere and activates global warming. The government tries to protect the ecology and it is social welfare. That is why there is a question – should government control air travel?
I agree that air transport creates negative effects that can do a lot harm to Earth but all kinds of industry damage ecology (for example, chemical industry, atomic factories).Government can not reduce activities of all industries (in this case people need to produce less goods with such results like famine and lack of goods). To control only air travel is pointless without influence on other dangerous industries because ecology will suffered anymore.
Moreover air travel is more fast then train travel. The plains save human resources (time is great value nowadays). People need to spent 7 days to reach Vladivostok from Moscow. It is enormous costs of time and the conditions in Russian trains are definitely uncomfortable. People suffer if they need to spent some days in trains.
Finally, it will be unefficient law because it will create a lot of problems, it will limited people’s comfortable way of life and at the same time there will be no results in protection the ecology. The global warming will continue because of other dangerous industries.
