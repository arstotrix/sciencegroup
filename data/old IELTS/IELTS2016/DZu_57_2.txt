Nowadays, many people believe that the air travel may cause the pollution of the atmosphere and the rising temperatures. But others claim that the reducing of the number of air travellings may lead to other problems and would not be the solution of this problem.
In my point of view the travelling by planes may lead to the huge negative chages in our nature. First of all, planes produce the unhealthy gas that pollute the atmosphere. Imagine, how many people travel now when you have breakfast or writing the exam. This number is incredibly big.
Secondly, the air pollution may bring the health problems: headaches and so on. Undoubtedy, the air is very important and sagnificant in our life and to our bodies. If we breath the durty air, polluted by the big ammount of planes, we will feel ourselves bad and uncomfortably. That is why we have to breath only the clear air to safe our life and health.
I strongly agree with the statement of goverments that offer to reduce the number of the air travel. I think that this measure will bring a positive affect on this problem. For example, the government can create the rules of the range of posibilities to travel and how many times you could leave your own country (you can not travel about 5 times per month).
In conclusion, I would like to say that it is very important for people and nature what air is surrounding us. We must safe our world and do not pollute it by planes. It is the worldwide problem. Letâ€™s think about it.
