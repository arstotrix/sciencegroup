Nowadays there are a lot of dangerous effects to our environment, which was produced by human. One of each is a airplain, which we can find on the sky, can be a reason of global warming and other pollution of air. So, government should control the number of air travels and I fully agree with this statement.
Firstly, today not absolutely all air travels is necessary. Humanity started to economy time on a trip and in the same time we forgot about damages to our planet. For example, trips to not long distance, which can put just 6-8 hours by car or train. Goverments should laws the amount of such types of air travels. In my point of view, the best way to dicion this problem is make air travel to short distance just for sick and older people.
On the another hand, the most people will not agree spent hours or days just for way to some place, and the same situation can influence to economy of much countries in not a good side. Today a lot of country try to find a way to not dangerous travel for enviroment, like a bio-force and other. But now it is impossible to come true, so people should try to safe our air with another way.
To sum up the information, the best dicision of safing our planet from global warming and air pollution is a fully not dangerous air travel, which maybe we will be have in future. But for today we and our government should think about air pollution more and introduce laws a number of air travel.
