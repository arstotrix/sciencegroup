The given bar chart represents the quantity of small children from different parts of the world, who were not able to enroll for studing in primary schools within the period of 12 years.
It can be clearly seen from the diagram, that African region can be named absolute leader in the number of kids, not attending primary schools. The figure declined slightly, during the period and in 2012 a bit more than ⅓ of young Africans still didn’t attended schools. It is easy to notice, how dramatically the number of primary school pupils have risen in South Asia in 12 years.: from 67% in 2000 to 90% in 2012. What is more, it is surprising, living in the 21th century, that primary school education is more acceptable for boys, exept South Asia and Rest of the World in 2012.
Summing up, there is no doubt, that children from different parts of the world do not have equal access to many prospects, such as, education in primary schools.
