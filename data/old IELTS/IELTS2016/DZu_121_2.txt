Contemporary life underminds commuting by aircrafts, but some people say that it is a great harm to the nature and presevibe their governments to rule this issue by a law. According to my opinion this is the just obvious propaganda of “green” lobby, because any Vulcanic erruption could being more disaster in sphere of air polution that all air crafts, vehicles, trains and so on toghether do.
But let’s presume that is not a propaganda, but the real issue. Let’s take a glame on a statement ‘air travel for business is is unnecessary”. That means businessmen should commute by trains, trains run on electricity, electricity is manufactured by hydro electricity stations, used water poisons the air, that was a reason that even on a first glance eco friendly subjects can cause any type of polution.
Also second reason contributes to law making process. How would they rule this aspect of life? What would be the evidence of crucial needs for transporting by air craft? According to the theory of law foctriue needless empovering of laws causes corruption on frouds. To put it short-new aircraft law will cause corruption.
Finally that is vital to say that air polution and global warming is not a modern problem, It is fake that was made by lobbys in order to earn money, governments help them in order to get financial interest. All modern lows about eco engines is provided in order to uprise consumer society, but that is another kind of problem.
