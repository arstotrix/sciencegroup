On this graph we can clearly see how many children did not have access to primary education. There are the columns which are connected with three regions and each column has number of both girls and boys who could not have primary education. We can see that number of african children without access to primary school dipped from nearly 45 millions in 2000 to about 32.5 millions in 2012. There are nearly 25% less boys and girls in Africa who do not have access to primary education in 2012. In Asia there were nearly 32.5 millions of children who could not obtain primary education in 2000 and in 2012 that number dramatically fell to approximately 10 millions. There are nearly one fourth of Asian boys in 2012 who did not have access to primary education compared with the year of 2000. In the rest of the world we can see that in 2012 there are two thirds of number of 2000 boys who could not get access to primary school, while the number of children in the rest of the world dipped from 23.5 millions to nearly 15 millions.
So, the most significant changes can be seen in South Asia, while in Africa and in the rest of the world changes are not so great.
