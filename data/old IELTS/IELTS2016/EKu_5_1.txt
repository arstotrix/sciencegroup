In these two charts the data on the usage of Facebook is represented. The first chart demonstrates how users' choice of devices to connect to Facebook changes, and the second chart shows the main reasons for using Facebook for men and women. As it can be seen in the first chart the users' preferences has changed during a year. In March 2012 the number of users who prefered to log in with their computer was more than 150 million users, but this number has reduced to less than 140 million users by March 2013. At the same time, mobile devices increased in popularity: the number of their usage has raised from less than 60 million to almost 100 million, which makes a 40 million growth. The second graph shows why people are using Facebook. It seems that women are more active users as their rates are generally higher for almost all statements, except for receiving updates which both 39% of men and women consider as one of the main reasons. Sharing photos and videos turns out to be the most popular reason for using a social network, especially among women as 54% of them named it, comparing to 39% of men of the same opinion. Women seem to be more attracted to funny posts: 43% of them told about it, while only 35% of men did the same thing. And 35% women also claim that they use Facebook to learn about the ways to help others, while 10% less men showed interest in it. So, this is the data on the use of Facebook which can be found in these two charts.
