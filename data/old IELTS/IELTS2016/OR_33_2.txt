Nowadays, there are a lot of families, where parents are always busy by working and can not take care of their children. However, in the past, people had more opportunities to spend time with them. Let’s try to find out the reasons of current situation.
First of all, parents have many possibilities to give their children to the kindergarden or a special all-day school. Fortunately, there are enough such places in the Moscow. Moreover, they can easily to call a nurse. In my point of view, people prefer to use such methods because they would like to make money for a living. Our times is hard because of crisis and sometimes parents haven’t got other choice. Secondly, sometimes people make a family in the young ages, when they are not ready to conduct a clear behavior for children. Therefore, parents have to spend almost their strength and time for working and studying. Talking about problems, I would like to note that the best way to give the right conditions of behavior is to show it on your own. Nevertheless, parents don’t give enough attention for it and allow their children to take habbits from other people. However, parents can’t be sure that children society is polite and have clear thoughts. Moreover, kids should feel that they are not in danger and their parents are always ready to help them to cope with different problems. In conclusion, it Is important to say that situation is changed in worse side. Parents are keen on their jobs and forget about the most crucial thing in the world – children, which requires their attention.
