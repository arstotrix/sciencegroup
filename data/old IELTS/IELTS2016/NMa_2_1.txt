The given graph illustrates how the number of children without any opportunity to get to get a primary school education has changed during the period from 2000 to 2012. There is a data from three regions: Africa, South Asia and the rest of world.
Firstly, it is important to notice that the number of those children decreased dramatically in all regions. Another similarity is that boys are usually more educated, while more girls have no access to primary schools.
The worts situation is in Africa. I 2000 year the number of not educated children was almost 45 millions (20 millions boys and 23,7 girls). In 2012 the results became better: 33 millions with 14,5 millions of boys and 18,2 millions of girls.
I 2000 year the smallest number was in the rest os world: 10,5 millions of boys and 12,8 of girls. But in 2012 the best results shows South Asia with only 10 millions children without opportunity to get a primary school education.
To sum up we could say that the most important information in this graph is that the number of not educated children reduces every year and we hope that results of 2012 year are not the limits.
