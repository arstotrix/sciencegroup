Not everybody know that today a lot of international companies move of begin their business to poorer countries. Some people think that it is a good idea to employ local workers and develop this economy, but somebody refused it. There is some arguments. One important thing is that local people are invited to the new working places. Befor poorer or homeless worker can get oportunity to earn some money. Another fact, developing countries have low taxes. That is why it is convinient for businessmen to get much higher income from company than in developed countries. The fewer taxes the fewer salaries. For example, to knite clothes is better in developing countries because of it is used to pay lower salary. What is more the local economy begin the develope. Such country as China normalize ther economy due to international companies and the largest amount of production. However, there are some opinion which refused this idea. First of all, people loose their work places especially workers in production. People which have not higher education have a good oportunity to get good salary just work in production of goods. Moreover, sometimes goods and things does not have higher level of quality, even it is enough expensive. Without pirmission it led to trustless from customers and sells are down. To sum up, I think that more companies should more their business to developing countries. But if it is very difficult system in the organization which need educated people with nessecery knowledge, it is better way to stay in developed countries.
