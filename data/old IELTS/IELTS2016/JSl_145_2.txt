There is a heated discussion about benefits and disadvantages of moving manufacturies of big companies to developing areas. Some people think that it helps to poor countries to grow economically. Otherwise, there are some people, who have another opinion.  Some experts think that opening factories of worldwide brands is leading to a higher taxes income to a governmental budget. And it also helps to give a job work place to unemployed part of the society, which would also increase budget of state. Moreover producing in developing areas is quite cheaper than in developed ones, wich means that prices all over the world will be low. However, besides advantages mentioned above there are some contr view about this issue. even if local people are employed in international companies’ manufactory they get very low salaries. Also sometimes they have an unlimited working day or bad working conditions, high temperature or gases, which may much their health. Ethnic manufactures or traditional businesses are often numped by new big “neighbours” of international companies because they are more powerful and may have some sort of contracts with loyals and states, which open not accesed to a local firms. From a general point, I think that moving business to developing countries is a good step, because a lot of people get a job. However, they still stay in a bad living conditions, which means that there are should be international rules for global firms directing how to deal and employ workers. Also world wide organizations like Greenpeace should control factories and companies should be responsible for environmental friendly production. To sum up, all the benefits of opening international business in developing areas outweight the disadvantages, because it can lead to a good global changes in future.
