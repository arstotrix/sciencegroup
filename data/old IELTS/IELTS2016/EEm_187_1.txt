This chart gives us information about about amount of children which can not have primary school education. The information is given from 2000 to 2012 and is sorted by region and gender.
We can see a good tendence of decreasing this group of children in all regions during this time.
The biggest difference shows us South Asia, where the number became more than three times less. From 32.7 millions to 9.9 millions. In Africa this amount also decreased, but not as much as in South Asia; it became just 24 percent less in 2012. Rest of world had the same dynamic and decreased as well from 23.3 in 2000 to 15.3 in 2012.
Talking about gender, we see that the most significant changes are in Asia. The number of girls decreased more than 4 times from 21.6 in 2000 to 4.8 in 2012. All other genders in all other regions also decreased but not as much as girls in Asia, and the percent of their decrease is from 20 to 50.
Taking everything into consideration we can argue that all of the given in the chart regions and genders have dynamic to decrease.
