Nowadays, we have a lot of kind of transport such as bicycle, segways, cars, tubes, trains buses and so on. But one of the amazing and great human’s invention is airplane. Airplanes make our travels more cheap and quick. Many people guess that a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. In my honestly opinion, I suppose that plane’s metal heart has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. Not the level of world’s ocean rose every day. Many scientiest gives information about cataclysm, tsunami and activilization of volcano. With global warming many of endemics may be lost. By the other hand, without air travelling we will meet many problem face-to-face. For example, our trade company can not work with profit. In my view, enginers and architectors should invent eco-fuel and engine.
