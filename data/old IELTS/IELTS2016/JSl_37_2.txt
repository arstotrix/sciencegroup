There is an opinion that the amount of air travel should be reduced in the case it influences badly the atmosphere and leads some global problems. On the other hand, there are lots of other things wich polute the air and spoil the atmosphere. I personaly suppose we do not have to decrease the number of trips in the air and should pay more attention to other areas. To begin with, the huge number of factories are spreaded all over the world and some of them produce too much waste in the air. Moreover, most of the countries have different scales of the wasting level. Thus, we can not control the quantity of air pollution in such a great amount. Furthermore, reducing the number of plains may lead to the increase of the usage of other kinds of transport, for instance, cars and trains which also need fuel and cause air polution and even global warming. Besides, lots of places on the planet will become difficult to visit. Nevertheless, there are some advantages in the idea of reducing the number of air travel. Plains use lots of fuel which is in a lack on the Earth. The less we fly, the less global problems we have. To sum up, the idea of introducing the laws of decline the level of air travel is not the main and the most effective way of reducing the air polution and avoiding the process of global warming. There are plenty of possible ways to deal with these problems with a greater result.
