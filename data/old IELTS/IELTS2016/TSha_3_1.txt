The graph illustrates the percentage of people aged 65 and over in the period from 1940 to 2040 in Japan, Sweden and the USA. Overall, it is clear that all three lines fluctuate during the period. However, there is a tenancy to the number of adult population increasing.
Proportion of population aged 65 and over was almost equal - in Sweden and the USA from 1940 to 1990, however, while the USA line remained steady untill 2015 and then started to grow rapidly, the Sweden line was fluctuating. In contrast, the amount of adult population in Japan started to increase after a small decline from 1940 to 1960 and then rocketed in 2025-2035, crossing both Sweden and the USA lines. Finally, it grew to about 28%, what is almost 6 times more than at the beginning of the period.
In conclusion, the graph shows that the amount of people aged 65 and over will grow by 2040. Moreover, Japan will have the most significant difference between proportions of 1940 and 2040.
