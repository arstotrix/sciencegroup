Nowadays air transport is the popular and safe kind of transportation. Thanks to airplane people come to nesseccary places faster than they can use other transport. Governments want to create laws that allow to use airplane for business trips, however a big number of people deny these laws.
On the one hand, airplanes should use as before for travelling, business trips and so on. Firstly, people who fly to rest to America, for example, spend for about 14 hours from Moscow. If governments introduce laws that can’t allow to fly for rest, people can’t come to America because airplane is the most suitable way for transportation. Secondly, in many touristic cities will begin economical crysis because most of tourists can’t go to the country without air transport.
On the other hand, governments should to reduce the number of flying. Firstly, often flies reduce lead to global warming and problems with air. Every year the temperature in the planet increase on some degree. The sea ice that used to protect the Alaskan coast from violent waves is melting rapidly. Secondly, many airplanes fly with a few number of people because of economical crysis people can’t afford to buy expensive tickets.
In my opinion, governments shouldn’t reduce the amount of air travel just for leisure and business. Modern technology are developing faster and I hope in the nearest future people will create airplanes which will not damage atmosphere. Now marketologs can research how often people fly to some countries and reduce just unpopular flyings.
To sum up, modern people need air travel a lot and governments shouldn’t reduce flyings because the all reasons mentioned above. Future technology in airplanes will help to do better and safer flyings, save our planets from catastrophe.
