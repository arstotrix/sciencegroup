Recently, the moving of various sorts of business to developing countries with pour economics becomes a worldwide common trend. The establishment of large international companies' filials in pourer countries is controversial issue having both benefits and disadvantages. In my opinion, this trend is generally positive and may lead to trule business improvements in the current world. It makes no sense to negate that expanding of business to developing countries has a lot of financial benefits. Cheap work forces, stadily increase of jobless emploees, huge amounts of free spaces - all these factors may make the production of any goods or items profitable. The owners of companies spend the minimum of costs and get the maximum of profit. Besides, this sort of business is not hard to start in a pouper country: the local people do not tend to refuse the offers from well-known internetional firms.  However, there are the number of problems which are directly connected with expanding business in developing countries. First of all, these problems impact on well-being of the local citizens. In fact, the allien business actually makes the local manufactures become extinct. The small manufacturers cannot prevent the competition; consequently, they should simply close their productions. Secondly, the owners of large companies usually try moving to pourer countries only harmful productions. It is obviously that this affect the local natural world devastating it. It may causes many environmentally disasters. In conclusion, it can be said that, despite the fact that moving business to pourer countries effect them not in the best way, the most of nowadays large international companies have their filials in developing countries. In fact, the current world market is constantly full because of good work of pouper countries' emploees.
