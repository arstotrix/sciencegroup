These days, globalization enables people to travel around the world. People are able to travel by plane, by car and so on. But how does mass-tourism influence our environment? Some people hold the view that it is air travelling to blame for damagin the environment and actions should be taken to reduce it. Personally I can see both sides of the argument and partly agree with this opinion. In this essay, I will introduce my point of view and support it with examples.
Firstly, there are a huge amount of factors which contribute to air pollution and global warming except of air travel. For instance, cars produce emissions and gases into the atmosphere. As a result, people start to suffer from air pollution. Secondly, the usage of aerosols destroys the ozone layer, as they contain CFC gases. Therefore, the destruction of ozone layer leads to a global warming.
On the other hand, aircrafts also produce some harmful emissions. Moreover, many people travel without much necessity. To solve this problem, governments want to set up some laws to reduce unnecessary travelling.
To sum up, I would like to point out that despite the fact that air travel is responsible for damaging the environment, there are the other more dangerous factors, such as the proliteration of cars and various aerosols. The way forward might be not only reduce air travel but also to stop living in a throwaway society.
