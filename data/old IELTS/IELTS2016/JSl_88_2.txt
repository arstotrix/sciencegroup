Today it can be seen that a lot of international companies relocated their business to poor less developed countries. There a frequent discussion about this topic and about its advantages and disadvantages. A lot of people say that moving business have many benefits and major one of them is that this business give economical boost to the poor countries. In other words, international companies create many working places, stimulate local producers, from which they buy resources and pay huge taxes. Second possible advantage is that economicy do not develop main world centers but develops almost equaly in whole world. For instance, car European car producers moved part of their business to the Africa, so this brought some development. On the other hand, business moving has a lot of critics who notice negative points of this process. Firstly, that is known that usually international companies relocate their factories to get more low paid workers and to remove ecological danger from home country. For example, near the River in India there a lot of relocated manufacturies which pollute air, water and soil so-located people suffer from this. Secondly, these international companies have no competitors in country market. They are economically strong and some companies just can not compite with them so this bring stagnation to the country. To sum up, moving business to the poor countries has advantages and disadvantages but, own personally believe that advantages of this process outweigh the disadvantages and it is positive development for out world.
