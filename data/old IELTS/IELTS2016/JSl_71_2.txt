Nowadays in the era of globalization. The bussiness  is established across the boarders and that is why many international companies move their businesses to developing countries and employ local workers I strongly believe that there are more advantages than disadvantages and there are some reasons. Firstly, moving a business to another country means an expand of its spectre of influence. For example, Apple Company will start selling their products in North Africa and from that they will get a profit and potential costumers who will continue buying their goods. Also, according to “The Guardian” ‘s research if developing countries will go out on an international market the profit will increase by 30%. Secondly, employing local workers decides each government’s problem: unemployment. According to financial research it seems that in Samsung Company in Los Angeles work 30000 people. Now imagine if such company will establish their filial in Egypt and how many people can have a possibility to get well-paid job. Thirdly, starting a business in developing countries also helps it’s economy. New investments will stimulate the national economy and the country’s government can overcome the crisys or money in different spheres. On the other hand, there are some problems companies can face in such countries. For instance, there would not be many classified workers company can employ or the political situation does not allow to start business here. Besides, there can not be a lot of potential costumers and company will only lose from an investment. However, I think that these problems depend on time and companies, for example, can make courses for potential workers of just wait until the situation will not be stable. Summing up, I should say that there are always two sides of ones coin but in this case there are more advantages that companies can bring to the world than disadvantages.
