Some people says, that airplane distruct atmosphere and air pollution. So, governments introduce some laws, which will reduce number of travelers, who go on airplane for relax or something else. I agree with it opposite, because today it is a global problem, which connect with global warming and air pollution. In last years, I take apart in, which was called “Earth hour”. Every year all people in planets turn of the light one hour. I think that governments can level up the price ticket on airplane or introduce some tax on travel. It will be scare people and they will travel on bus, car or train. Secondly, goverments could send to prison if you cut trees, but it is only my mind.
