In this report I would like to describe the graph that indicates changes in worldwide investment in renewable energy from 2006 to 2013. It shows rates for developed and developing countries as well as world total amount. Up to 2012 there is a steady growth of investments in developing countries. In 2013 a small drop could be noticed approximately from almost 150 billion dollars to 120 billion dollars. Comparing to the developed countries, the total amount of investments is almost twice lower over the entire period. Investments in developed countries are higher, but less stable. There are two periods when the investments in developed countries were increasing annually. The first one is from 2006 to 2008 and the second is from 2009 to 2011. Since 2011 investments start to decrease in developed countries. In 2012 when the level of investment in developed countries decreased, it rose in developing countries. World total investment changes share similar trends with the developed countries. In 2011 investments reached their peak in developed countries and also in the world total. Figures for the world total in this year is 279 billion dollars.
