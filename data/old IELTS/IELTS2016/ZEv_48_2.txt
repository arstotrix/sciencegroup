Scientist proved that travelling by air could be harmful for the environment, it causes air pollution and may lead to a global warming effect. Some people persist on the decrease in air travels for a lot of them are just for pleasure. By setting some new laws. I completely disagree with this idea and try to explain the reasons for this.

firstly, I want to speak about pollution in general. Nowadays almost all manufactures pollute the nature. They split spoiled gas into the atmosphere, put waste into rivers and soil. Different tipes of gas used every day enlarge the ozon gap which lead to global warming. So the air travel is hot of primary importance to take measures on. Because the harm from it is really miserable compared to others.

Secondly, people are free to go to wherever they want to. This right is laid in the basic human rights. No law could restrict people from travelling wheather it is a business matter or just for leisure one. The only thing the government could and thould do is to recommend to chose alternative means of transportation. Moreover, it is a great question if this alternatives would pollute the air less than airplanes.

In conclusion, the air travel should not be reduced by the law because it controverse the law itself. the governments could plan to fund the budget into the finding of solution to this problem. By enventing a new mean of transport which spoils the environment less. But today the situation is that there is no fast and convinient substitude for air travelling.
