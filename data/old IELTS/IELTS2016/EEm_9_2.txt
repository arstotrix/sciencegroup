Nowadays travelling by air is a wide spread way of transportation people and goods. However, despite such advantages as fast speed of this kind of transport there are disadvantages like air pollution. It is commonly believed that the amount of air travels should be reduced by law to stabilize the ecological situation. I am strongly in favour of the idea that such measures must be taken.
Firstly, to my mind, there are a number of various and more ecological ways to travel besides planes, therefore governments could increase the number of passangers who will travel by train, by sea and so on. This measure will provide a decrease of the pollution, while people can still travel easily. Secondly, I suppose that such potential result of air pollution as global warming which could change the climate in the Earth and lead to destruction of our world is much more important than convenient of people who do not want to spend much time and care about the future of our planet.
Finally, in my view, such amount of air travel is really unnecessary, as today people have their own cars and they are able to reach the destination point using their own means of transport. Consequently, governments can encourage people to use their cars more.
In conclusion, we should admit that the air travel should be limited by law to avoid global warming and its consequences. In addition to decrease the amount of air travels, governments are able to stimulate people to use their own cars or alternative means of transport, otherwise the situation will become worse.
