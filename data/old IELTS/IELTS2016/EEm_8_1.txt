Generally, the biggest proportion of children without education is seen in Africa both for boys and girls. Although, that proportion was reduced in ten years, Africa remained the country with the worst education conditions.
The largest development over ten years showed the region of South Asia. It is immediaty evident that it has reduced the number of boys without access to schools by more than a half. As for girls, their number declined nearly four times within ten years. this result brought South Asia to the first place among other regions. As for the rest of the world, it has experienced not such drammatic fall as Asia but the education conditions were improved for approximately one third of boys and girls.
