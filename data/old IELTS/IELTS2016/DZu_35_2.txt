There are many factors that contribute air pollution and global warming, but one of the most significant of them is considered to be air travelling. Some people believe that many of the flights are unnecessary and there should be some laws, which could help to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure in order to save the ecosystem.
On the one hand, that point of view is reasonable. Firstly, air travelling can be substituted by other means of transport with some benefits. For instance, going from Moscow to Vladivoctok by train can help a person to see the beauty of Russian nature. Secondly, some of the business trips can be changed in order workers were able not ot fly to a certain destination, but to drive by car. For example, businessmen from Russia and Germany can meet in Lithuania, so that both of the sides of negotiations would complete the same amount of kilometres and none of them would have to fly by plane.
On the other hand, travelling by plane can not be babbed or reduced in some cases. First of all, there are some routs that are almost impossible to go, using alternatives. For instance, travelling from Europe to America by ship would take much time and that is why probably would be unpopular. Moreover, there are other ways of solving the problem of air pollution, despite simply reducing the amount of air travel by law. One of the best decisions is to use eco-friendly fuels in the plane engine.
All in all, I am convinced that there is no need to reducee the number of flights for business and leisure. People should be concerned more about the quality of the fuel or the materials, of which the plane made, but not the quantity of those.
