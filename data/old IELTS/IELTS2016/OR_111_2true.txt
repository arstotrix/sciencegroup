It is a well-known fact that nowadays kids have more freedom and more time to spend with themselves due to the fact that parents are busy because of their work. This problem is very significant for our modern society. First of all, a lot of adult people have to leave their children in the case of work because of financial situation. It is very hard to have a high income without working of both parents. For example, if people want to show their love to a kid, they should try to buy some candies or toys, especially for babies, but nowadays these types of goods are very expensive. Secondly, lots of parents think about their kid’s education before they grow up, so adults try to have some extra money for a future, so they understand that they should go out to work together. For example, nowadays government prefers parents to pay for their children’s education and study in the university. Moreover, it is hard for many parents to stay at home with their kids for their freedom. However, such phenomena causes lots of problems. For a lot of children it is very important to spend time with their parents, because it is one of the main factor in the childhood. Furthermore, adults play the most important role in developing children’s behaviour. In addition to this, spending less time with parents can cause such problems as loss of connection and in future it will be very hard to communicate for parents with their kids. To sum up, the relationships between a child and a parent are very strong from the birth, but it is very easy to destroy them by spending less time with your whole family.
