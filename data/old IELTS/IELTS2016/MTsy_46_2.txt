Some people believe that airplans greatly pollute the air, so the government should reduce the number of air travel. I particularly agree with this statement.
On the one hand, air travel has harmful effect on our environment. Firstly, the gases from airplants pollute the atmosphere, so it lead to global warming and other problems. Secondly, the airplan is a kind of transport which needs a lot of oil. Oil is unrenuable source of energy, so such waste is harmful for our nature. Thirdly, often people fly in airplans, which has a few number of passengers. Itâ€™s a waste of sources, money for air companies.
On the other hand, air travel is unnesessary kind of transport. Firstly, only airplan can flights fast and passengers can more from one place to another for a few hours. Some decades ago people spend days or weeks to travel. Secondly, if the government reduce the amount of air travel, the number of cars on the road will grow up, so the air will be polluted much, and has worse effect. Thirdly, the airplans is the most safe transport in our world, so flights can not save lifes, but the amount of car crash is bigger.
To sum up I can say that reducing the number of air travel for business and leisure can be helpful for nature and people, but on the other hand, the cars pollute the air and have more harmfull effect throw gases. I think, the government shoul not change the situation and should not introduce any new laws about air travel.
