It is widely known that in our times it is popular among international companies to change locations of their businesses moving them to developing and less rich countries and employ local workers. This thend seems to have its own advantages, but at the same time it has its drawbacks. In the following essay they both will be considered compared with. On the one hand, the such a development appeares to bring significant benefits both to the countries where buisnesses are moved and to the companies that act in this way. For companies it is good, firstly, because in developing countries there are no as many rivals as in developed ones; therefore, these international companies can almost totaly occupy corresponding spheres, market sectors, etc. Secondly, local employees in developed countries require significantly bigger salaries; consequently, the companies moving their businesses to developing countries can spent less money on workers. As for local habitants, they have more opportunities to find job and can be sure of the quality of production they get from these companies.Â  However, in such a development there are several disadvantages. Maybe the main of them, for instanse, is that occuping spheres of their buisnesses they hardly leave a chance for local developers to run their own buisnesses. As a consequence of that predominance of international companies, it can be argued that because of monopolies which are established in this way it becomes difficult to control quality, prices, etc. All in all, it can be said that the disadvantages noted in the essay although being unpleasant in some ways do not outweigh the advantages, for a developing country receiving an international company gains experience and approaches to the level of devepoled countries. Therefore, if sometime in the future it decides to develop its own businesses, it will have enough money, educated people and other resources to do that.
