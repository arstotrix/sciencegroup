Since ancient times the attitude towards educational process has been changing. The dividing by the sex criteria has been exhausted since formation of democratic societies. However, there is a need to discriminate males and females by their interests and abilities. People argue that the amount of  male and female students have to be equal in each educational group. I tend to disagree with the previous statement.
  Firstly, it is irrelevant to apply the same equal studying positions. It means, that there are a lot of circumstances which are not under regulating. For example, traditionally, women occupies the sphere of phylology in the higher rate than men. On the other hand, men associated with engineering programs. In addition, it is impossible sometimes to find an equal amount of both: men and women, and prompt them to study together. Furthermore, the consolidation will might have not a positive effect on profession's development because of the lack of correlation between the sex and profession.
Secondly, it is hard to imagine how universities will compel alumni to choose the subject. We must not overestimate the genuine idea of education. The wish is more important today than in the past. It means that every young teenager is to have an opportunity to make his/her right choice. I consider, that this process must not be under universities' control, thus the human right might be restricted. Consequently, every male or female student must not be involved in adult's manipulations. There is no an essential need to count the number of male and female student, to change student's mind and to create discriminative social climate in each student group.
To sum up, it is a very difficult question about the regulation of numbers of male and female students. The main idea is not to mix the sex discrimination with the interest discrimination.
