The two graphs show the amount of money invested in the renewable sources of enegry during the eight-year period from 2006 to 2013. The counties here are divided into two groups, according to their economical level: more successful countries are named "developed" and their indices are presented at the left of each small bar chart. Less successful states are named "developing countries" and their results are shown at the right of every bar chart. From all the bar charts it can be noticed that all over the seven years the investement of the developed countries are always higher than those of the developing countries. However, there is a tendency of increasing of the amount of money given by the developing countries. During the first seven years this index riose from approximately 50 to 105, but in the last year it declined a little bit.Â The situation with the developed countries is not so stable: its amount increased firstly and than decreased in 2009, while over all it increases throught years. At the top of the picture the line presenting the world total investment can be seen. It is a summary of all the numbers over all the world. According to this line, the index increased significantly from 100 to 171 in the first three years, then there was a stagnation, the it rose again. It is interesting that there it droped dramatically during the last period and maybe this tendency will continue in the future. It can be concluded that the amount of investment in the renewable energy increased significantly during the presented period.
