In my opinion, the problem of air pollution by the planes is is closely connected with globalization leisure. First for all we have to decide for yourself is the process of globalization good or bad. If there are more pros than cons, we should admite the negative side of globalization, like the air pollution as a fact, which can not be totally solved. And now turning to globalization process, in my opinion it has more pros than cons: I am an international student and I have to use aircraft to go to my home country. While the process to globalization is developing, the aviatickets become more more cheeper, which allows me to bye them. If the government decides to reduce the number of air travels, we could see the demand on air travel will dramatically increase. It will leed to that fact, that the aviatickets become more expensive, which cannot be bought by ordinary people. It will be the example of social inequality, which will influence negatively on government reputation. In conclusion, I think that the air pollution a not subject of an issue, because cars produce much more polute gases than anything else, by the way. Governments shouldn’t introduce laws of remove the amount of using polute machines, however governments may influence on technology side. For example, to develop and implement laws, which don’t allow people to use vey polute machines. Laws have to represent standart of allowed pollution. To sum up, governments shouldn’t implement tough measures to solve this problem, but have to implicate modern methods and economic instruments in order to make producing of pollution rather expensive, that it will not damage environment like in present times.
