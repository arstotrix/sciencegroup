As soon as planes were invented, humanity explored a great amount of opportunities to transport stuff quicker, or people easier. However, enormous number of flights causes damage to air by polluting it with fuel gases and being one of the most important reasons of global warming. So governments are asked to reduce number of flights by law. Some people are hardly agree with this statement pointing on other means of transport, like ships or trains, which seem to them more ecologically-friendly. What is more, nowadays we were presented with cars, working on electric engine, which cause minimum harm to nature as soon as they do not operate with fuel. On the other hand, planes are considered to be the most secure among other means of transport. The chance of dying after air chach is enormously lower then, for instance, attend a car crash. Moreover, air travel is the fastest way of travelling and remembering that we are living in current world, where the most common idiom is “Time is money”, hardly could we deny the importance of air travel. Lots of businessmen spend most of their time doing business-trips. If they had not been able to fly from country to country, they would have spent their lives travelling endlessly. To crain it all, I should admit that air travel earned my respect after many long-hours trips to different countries, which I would not have been able to visit in case my family and I had not had an opportunity to use planes. So, I strongly disagree that we had better reduce air travelling. And the advantages of air travelling outweigh the probability of  a pollution and harm to nature.
