Today, some global corporations prefer to move their means of capital abroad to save money on different aspects of production. Some argues that developing countries just suffer from international “occupation”, others claim that both sides benefits on it. Following this essay we are going to discuss some prons and cons of doing business abroad. Nowadays there is a common practice for huge companies to move their business to poorer countries. What are the reasons to undertake such actions. As for the companies themselves, opening factories abroad is a paper way to cut pay-off by employing cheaper workforce. For instance, many US companies occupy Mexican boarder territories for the production purposes. Another popular reason for that is less strict legislation in poorer countries which allows far more wider set of actions concerning wastes and chemicals. So the companies save more, on technologies they use. On the other hand, the most harmfulless purpose is easier distribution to the largest consumers. For example, it would be really stressful to distribute Coca-Cola to Europe over the ocean if there are fabrics located in US only. As for the local people who are supposed to work for international companies in their own country, it seems to be that disadvantages outweight the advantages for them. Firstly, they tend to work longer hours for unfair pay for international production due to absence of other workplaces in their country. In this way local people are actually expoied. Secondly, people working there are mainly less qualified so that creates risks to get injured during working hours of get poisoned. Moreover, as was said above, large companies prefer to move dangerous and harmful production abroad which may cause air, ground and water pollution in the adopting country. To sum up, there will be sharp debates on this topic since it concernce money and people’s life. Eventually talking about prons and cons is meaningless unless there are money against people.
