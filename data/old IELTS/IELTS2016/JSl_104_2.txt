In present days more and more big corporations and other companies organize production of their products in developing countries (countries of the 3rd world), where they employ local poor population. This process has both negative and positive sides. First of all, all we know that the economic sphere is one of the most important. It organizes our lives and services which we use. That is why big organizations always try to make the production cheaper, in order to let people buy services for small costs. Developing countries can give that chance. Moreover, such countries often don’t have their own production, so that developed ones give working places and provide poor ones with the ability to earn money this kind of business developes the world’s economic issues. On the other hand, organization of the businesses in poor regions has dramatic consequences. If companies try to make the producing of goods cheaper, they often forget about conditions in which poor workers have to do their job and sometimes live. What is more, such trend of moving the businesses to developing countries has a great influence on the Europe economics. Other developed countries just don’t have the opportunities to get money and to be in the circulation of money. It appears in world crisises and stagnations which lead to financial collapses. To sup up all the facts, I can say, that disadvantages of transporting the business to the countries of the 3rd world are worse than advantages. Furthermore, the negative consequences of that are too difficult to terminate. That is why we should prevent them, not to correct.
