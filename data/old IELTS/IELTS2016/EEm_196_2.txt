Nowadays many people consider that air travel harms enviroment a lot. Some people tend to think the government should take steps to reduce number of air travel.
From my point of view air travel is one of the most important things in modern life. People for many years have been working to make air flights cheaper and more acceptable for ordinary people. But there are some people who claim that it is necessary to reduce number of flights to defend our planet. I farmly believe that there are a lot of different factor that pollute atmosphere more than planes like cars, nuclear energetic factories and others.
What is more, there are thougsands of aircompanies where employed thougsands of people which may lose their jobs in case of introducing new laws that will reduce the number of flights for business and leisure to provide the accomulation of assets and money in our country. I strongly believe that we should develop internetional collaboration, which may provide our country with much more money.
taking everything into consideration, I tend to think that the government should fight global warming using modern technologies. For example, create new engines for planes, that ecologicaly more safe than modern.
