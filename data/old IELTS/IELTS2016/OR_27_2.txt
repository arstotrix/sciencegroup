There is an opinion that when people travel by plan, they increase air pollution and influence negative on global warming. Because of it, goverments may introduce special laws which limite air travel. 
I totally disagree with this point of view. To my mind, there are a lot of other things which pollute our planet more and less important for society. For example, it is uneffective plants and so on. I recon, state should make plant more inviromentally-friendly and it help more then to reduce the amount of air ravel. Moreover, I strongly believe that people can create new technologies for air travel and they decrease emission of plan of, what will be really successful, find new type of power. May be, our plans will use electrisity in the future, for example. And goverment must focus on developing of technology, help to invest it and make the control. It is all. State should not introduce laws which only hide the problem, not to solve it.
Some people can say that there are other ways of transport and they more inviromentaly friendly. However, I do not think that this types is less polluted. All form of transport have many problems but I think that air traveling is the best way in any condition.
In conclusion, I would like to say that gowerment should not limite the amount of air travel. But should develop it. I believe that if state choose the right way, the air travel will not the problem.
