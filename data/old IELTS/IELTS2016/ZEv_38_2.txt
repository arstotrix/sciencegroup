Nowadays the problem of air pollution because of planes' fuels seems to be one of the most disscused and complicated. Some people strongly believe that air travel for business and leisure should be almost prohibited due to ecological reasons. However, I think that this measure will not solve the problem so easily.

First of all, there is still no alternative to the planes. People created fast ships and trains, but none of them can be compared to usual passenger airplane. The are some insurmountable obstacles with using, for example, cars. They are expensive and even more polluting, because gasoline is much more dangerous for the atmosphere than kerasine. Moreover, chance to get into accident is million times larger than while air travel, and this fact is proven by statistics.

Secondly, there are many things that government can do for saving the Earth. Take, for instance, the idea of making investments into development of more ecologically safe means of transportation. Goverments can restrict the taxes policy for air companies in order to get more money and build sun batteries and other fuel free sources of energy.

Some people think that flying by plane is not necessary, because it is always possible to find an alternative way of travelling. I cannot agree with that statement, because it can take weeks to travel from the one point to another. It is clear that time is the most expensive and valuable resource in people's lives. Just imagine: flight from Moscow to Krasnoyarsk takes 4,5 hours, while travelling there by train takes more than 4 days. Obviously, it can be really hard for children and elder ones, especially in summer time.

In conclusion I should say that despite other people's opinion I continue to believe that air travel is the safest and quickest one. Moreover, some ecological troubles that air planes cause can be easily overcomed with the help pf governments.
