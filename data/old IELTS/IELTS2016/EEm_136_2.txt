Nowadays, a lot of people argue about air travelling: can we use planes for business and leisure and don’t think about impact on our environment. Let’s discuss both points of views in this essay.
There are many key factors which can show us, that air travelling is very good decision if you have a need to move to another country, for example. Firstly, if we want think about bad impact, by plane you can manage any point “on the map” very quickly. Secondly, it will be very comfortable travelling if you will prefer plane to another type of transport. So, on the one hand, government should not reduce the number of flights, because it is the people’s choise.
On the other hand, many citizens can disagree with this point of view, because global warming and environmental pollution - problem for people all over the world. And if even government can’t introduce such laws, no one can do it. Of course, always there are people who do not agree with the laws, but in this case we do not accept people to kill each other, crash things they do not like. So, citizens, who want to reduce the amount of factors, which can harm our environment, shows us if there will not be clever mans in the government, travelling by plane for leisure will pollute the air, we breathe.
In conclusion, it can be said, that mankind needs help from the government to stop air pollution and global warming, which caused by people who think only about comfort, fast travelling, and do not think about healthy of their children. So, I agree with citizens, who want to have necessary laws.
