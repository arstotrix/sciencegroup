Today there are prooves that air travel causes air pollution and global warming. In this case, the law introduced by government should decrease the number of unnecessary flights, such as business and leisure air travel. In my point of view, this law could be a good solution and make impact in environment protection.
First of all, nowadays  the majority of airports offer a lot of type of planes with extra comfort options which contain less passengers while the level of damaging effect stay the same. For example, a lot of businessmen have private planes, which are comparable with the size of usual plane, but they use them for travelling with small number of people, like collegues or family, as frequent as usual plane is used. Consequently, they make the same ratio of damage.
Secondly, the reducing of the amount of business and leisure air travel could make more popular eco-friendly types of travel, such as, trains or electrocars. Some people think that plane is the fastest way to arrive in the destination point. However today the net of trains organised very convinient and it allows to move faster by train or tube in comparison with plane.
In conclusion, personally, the law reducing the number of unnecessary air travels could have a great impact on in decrease of air pollution and global warming because it reduces demaging effects and attracts attention to more environmentally friendly type of travelling.
