The table indicates the changes between childrenâ€™s access to primary school education in 2000 and 2012, linked with their sex and place of living. It is clear from the table that the number of children without access to the primary education in Africa is higher than in South Asia and the rest of the world. But it is obvious that to 2012 this situation has improved. It can be explained by the fact that a lot of humanitarian missions have been sending to the region to build new schools and to improve the way of life. The table also shows that the number of children without access to the school has declined significantly to 2012. Besides, in the rest of the world there are a great number of children who can attend primary school. To sum up, the difference between Africa, South Asia and the other regions is in their cultural traditions, where African and Asian attitude to education based mostly on their understanding of the roles of men and women.
