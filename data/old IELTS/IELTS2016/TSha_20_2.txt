There is a widespread opinion that the number of men and women entering a specific specialization in the university should be the same. I fully disagree with this view and strongly believe that such suggestion is absolutely unefficient.
First of all, it is obvious that men are more inclined to specific professions, and receive better results working in some fields. For instance, in engineering or physics specializations more men succeded, probably because of a different way of thinking. If universities start to accept the same number of male and female students, the progress in science is very likely to decrease. Subsequently, it will lead to the loss of efficiency and less developments. Moreover, if there are some vacant places on a certain faculty and all women are already accepted, the rest of the men applied for this programme will not have a chance to get education.
In contrast, some people contend that this suggestion should be accepted in order to obtain national equality and eliminate the descrepancy between both genders. Notwithstanding this idea, I think that this solution to the problem of unequality is not right. Students should be choisen by their skills and abilities that they demonstrated on the exams, otherwise it seems likely that talented or smart people in one field risk to study the subject they are not keen on.
Overall, to my mind, suggested idea mainly aimed to solve the problem of inequality, will only exacerbate the situation,, leading to a more serious descrepancy between men and women.
