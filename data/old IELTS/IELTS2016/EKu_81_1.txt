 &nbsp; The graph below shows us changes in worldwide investment in renewable energy from 2006 to 2013 in both developed and developing countries and as a world total. We can see one graph and one diagram on this picture.   &nbsp;At the first look at this picture we can see that the highest amount of investment was in 2011. Of course, we can notice that developed countries make more investment in renewable energy. Investment increased from 2006 to 2008. After, 2008 and 2009 were stabile years for investment in renewable energy for developed countries. The situation is opposite for developing countries, the amount of investment from them continued to go up from 2008 to 2012. But, we can't say that situation of investment from developed countries was the same. No. They have the highest level in 2011 and after their amount of investment dropped from 2011 to 2013. The world total investment went down from 279$Bn to 214$Bn, from 2011, when it has the highest mark, to 2013.  &nbsp;It may be concluded from the picture that world total investment increased from 2006 (100$Bn) to 2011 (279$Bn) and decreased from 2011 to 2013(214$Bn).
