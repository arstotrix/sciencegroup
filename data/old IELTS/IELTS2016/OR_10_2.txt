I partly agree with this statement. Eviernment problem is very important; but air travel too expencive, and laws to reduce the amount of air travel can kill this part of economic.
The main argue is unmecessary air travel and possibility alternative. Modern world has a lot of oppotunities for traveling such as sea travel, car travel; train travel and etc. Moreover, this alternatives have more positive ways as well-known time in transport. In airbus you see only sun and don’t see trees; buildings; sea; animals, if you going to America from Russia on train and sea transport, you can satisfight views around train. However; in airbus usually people sleep. Furthermore, air pollution very dangerous for future own children will live with lower level of health.
However, be argue cons. Air travel has some positive thing. The first, is time, today airplane has a big speed (900 km/h), it in 10 faster then all exict alternative. For a lot of people time very important, but if cost tise, people can’t buy ticket. To example: air travel to parent or to work. Globalitation today doesn’t given the chance to live in one location. Always travel given us positive emotional. Governments should helps business to create eco-airplain, too.
As a result, this problem has two point of view, If this statements to compare, we should says, that global warming and air pollution more dangerous and have more negatives consinqunces then positive from air travel. However; laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure isn’t the best solution, but easy solutions. And governments needed to compare all pros and cons, because in west Europe hasen’t problem with transport, without ban or reduce transport; it is the complex problem and should solution quick.
