The graph indicates changes in the amount of money that was invested in renewable energy during the period from 2006 to 2013 as a world total, and the bar chart -- in developed and developing countries. From the bar chart it is evident that investment in renewable enrgy made by developing countries through almost the whole period was increasing, but in 2013 it had a light drop. It reached its peak in 2012 when exceeded 100 * Bn. It also can be seen from the bar chart that developed countries always invested in renewable energy significantly more money than developing countries; for instanse, in 2006, the first year of the period, the investment of the former was 50 * Bn higher than of the latter. Until 2008 developing countries were raising the investments, however in 2009 it fell. Then, in 2010 and 2011 it soared and peaked at the level of aproximately 175 * Bn. Two last years were, again, the years of decrease. If one compares these trends, especially that of developed countries, with those in general, he or she will see that they are almost similar, since they had its minimum and maximum pooints at the same time and since droping and rising periods correspond to each other. To summarize, it can be said that developed countries had always significantly exceede developing in investment in reneable energy and that thends of developed countries are similar to those as a world total.
