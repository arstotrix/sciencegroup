 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Nowadays, there exist many international companies in developed countries. A lot of such companies tend to move their businesses to developing countries to employ habitants there. What are the advantages and disadvantages of this movement? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Some people claim that it is a good idea to move international companies' businesses to poorer countries. To begin with, this movement can help a developing country to improve its economic by selling companies' products. In addition,  a poor country can borrow new ideas or technologies produced by the company, that means it can get a status of a developed country. Moreover, international companies can employ local workers and it may lead to reduced unemployment and to increased number of work places which is also significant for developing.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, there is an opposite statement. Firstly, many local workers would prefer to work in an international company rather than in their countries' developing companies, so other companies might have no people to employ. Secondly, a developing country might borrow international companies' ideas and it means that it may have no own ideas that is actually bad for developing. Thirdly, it is more significant for all countries to create their own companies and to try to make them international, but because of the movement of other countries' companies it might have no sense so it can stop the developing process.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In conclusion, this problem has both advantages and disadvantages. Personally I think that it might be a good idea to move international companies' businesses to poorer countries because it help local people to find a good job. Hopefully, in the future the number of developing countries would decrease and all countries would be practically at the same lavel and have similar situation in economics.
