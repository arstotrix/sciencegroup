It is widely believed that giving longer prison sentences is the most efficient way to reduce crime. However, some people argue that there are plenty of better options to prevent people from comitting crimes. There is no doubt that making the punishment more severe, the government will decrease the number of criminals. The fear of spending a great part of their lives in prison will make potential criminals think twice whether the benefits they get from commiting a crime are worth the risk. Beside this preventive effect, there is an equally important one: if the sentences are longer, criminals will be isolated from the society for a longer time, which would have a great positive effect on the safety of citizens. However, it cannot be denied that this measure is not enough and has some disadvantages. The more people are in prison, the more funds the government (and, thus, the taxpayers) has to spend on them. Another ways of preventing people from commiting crimes should be used. Another problem is that many people believe that such strict measures should not be used in working with juvenile criminals which are not mature enough for being fully responsible for their actions. Some criminals are not dangerous for the society. To sum up, I can say that making the punishments stricter and the sentences longer is an effecting way to reduce crime, but not the very humanistic and economically reasonable one. The government should make sentences for some kind of crimes longer, but, all in all, it is only one of the measures it has to take, and more alternative ways to reduce crime should be applied.
