The chart gives information about amount of children (both boys and girls) who had no opportunity to get education in primary school in three parts of the world (Africa, South Asia and rest of world) from 2000 to 2012. Units are measured in millions of children. Overall, the chart illustrates that amount of children without access to education had decreased to 2012 around the world. As can be seen, the best indicator in 2012 had South Asia. The biggest number of children without primary school education in 2000 was in Africa (nearly 43 millions of children), the smallest one was in rest part of world. However, both locations had quite similar results of kids who got a possibility to access to school (10 millions in Africa and almost 8 in rest of world by the end of 2012). The gratest difference happend in South Asia where almost 33 millions of children started to access school in 2012, so only 10 millions of kids still are not educated.
