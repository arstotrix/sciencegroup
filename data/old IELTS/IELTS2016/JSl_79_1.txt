The bar chart shows investing in renewable energy in developed and developing countries, the flow chart atters the information given in the bar chart to a world total. Overall, investment in energy increased in both developed and developing countries. According to the information of the bar chart, it can be seen, that in 2006 companies invest about 75 $ bn in developed countries, while investment in developing countries was very poor â€“ about 25 $ bn (approximately). Then appears the increasing tendency in both types of countries until 2011, with only one exception, in 2009 investment in developed countries first time went down as the result. The peak of investment was in 2011. That time the investment in the type of energy in developing countries was twice as small as in developed ones. Since than can be seen a ramd decline until the end of this period. To sum up, investments of renewable energy in both countries increased, but by 2013 investment in this type of energy in developing countries increased much more than in developed countries.
