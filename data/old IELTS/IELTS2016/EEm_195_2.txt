In twenty first century it is difficult to imagine everyday life without hundred of flyies in the sky per day. Some people believe that as air travelling causes natural diseases such as global warming, governments should cut down of travelling up in the sky. In my personal view, it is a good idea to reduce the amount of flyights in order to air pollution. In this essay I will provide arguments for and against such governmental changes.
On the one hand, air traveling damages a lot our nature causing global warming, brining sharpness of ozone layer and so on. There are another possibilities to travel over a country or even abroad such as trains. Governments could easily introduce a law about traveling within a country by other kinds of public transport. Buses and trains are more convenient. What’s more, traveling by trains will broaden peoples horizons. By this I mean, meeting new people and reading books as the road will take more time. Moreover, it brings the opportunity to explore the landscapes and cultural unique settlements, cities and countrysides during a journey. As a result, the reducement of air travel will protect nature and broadens peoples’ minds.
On the other hand, sometimes it is really meaningful to be in the right place immediately. Businessmen hasn’t got enough of spare time to move by train and enjoy fasinating view through the window, they should in a business conversation in another country in an hour so there is no possibility to use another transport. Thuthermore, air travelling brings an opportunity to fast communication with international friends or even families who lives in another country.
It brings me to the conclusion, that although air traveling is really harmful for our surrounding and there are plenty of alternative ways for crossing kilometres, some people depends on flyights. I think it is up to people decide wheather they choose to use air travel or not.
