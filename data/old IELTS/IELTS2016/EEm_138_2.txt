Nowadays, it is generally accepted that an introduction of the possibility to travel by plane is a must for reduction of the air pollution level and the rate of global warming. Some would argue that this a necessary to enter the tax on the numbers of air travels to safe the environment. I firmly believe that this view  is incorrect and will give the reasons why in this essay.
It is certainly the case that there are many factors of air pollution and global warming, which should be reflected in the government policy instead of the control of the air travel quantity. This can be seen in countries such the USA where the renewable resourses are used in the heavy manufacturing to reduce the effects from both of named problems (air pollution and global warming). Some would claim that that the decline of the air transportation numbers will influence on the worldâ€™s problems positively, I feel strongly that there are a lot of much more powerful way the solve this problem.
A second major reason to choose another option to solve the issue with an air pollurion and global warming is a sociable one. Currently, travelling by plane is the safiest type of transportations all around the world. Despite the fact that this type of travel may include the oil consumption, I am convinced that the government must not prohibit the opportunity to travel by aircrafts, because of long distances.
Nevertheless, there are some groups of radical adherents, who insist on air travel number reduction. In spite of this, the desires of small groups must also be taken into consideration to avoid a social conflict.
To conclude, I believe that there are some other steps the government should take to reduce the effects from air pollution and global warming.
