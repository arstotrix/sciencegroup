Nowadays there are a lot of debates related to that question whether governments should reduce the number of flights for business and travelling reasons. Some people claim that traveling by air is one of the most popular ways of transportation. Firstly, because it is convenient and comfortable. What is more, it saves, your time and time is money. Anyway, I really feel that governments shouldn’t introduce laws to reduce the amount of flights. Mainly, of that simple reason that this measure  (restricting the rules for travellers) will definetly lead to social negative reaction. We all are people and we live in the 21 century, where everybody is used to visiting another countries and continents. Moreover, many of us have friends and relatives who live far away. Therefore, it wouldn’t be great if we won’t have any opportunity to see them.
i also guess that in case if such laws are introduced by governments - our world economy will suffer a lot. International business is the most important way in supporting world economy in most of the countries. Another point is that countries that get their main profit by travellers will become more poor. And I suppose it’s not a good perspective for them.
All in all, I trully believe that governments all over the world would never prohibit air travel for leisure and business. Otherwise, the outcome of this action will lead to disagreement between ordinary people in each place of the planet.
