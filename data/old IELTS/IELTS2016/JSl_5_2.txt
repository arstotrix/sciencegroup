Almost any day of the week you ca look at a newspaper and read articles discussing a theme about air pollution and global warming caused by the air travelling. There are several controversial points of â€¦ on this topic. The first regards governments should introduce special laws for reduction in the amount of travelling. Others consider people should find another methods for solving this problem.

Probably nobody would deny the fact that consequences of processes like global warming can lead to extinction of humans because people will not able to exist is changed weather conditions. That is why each country should have a low regulating this problem. It government will do this policy through air travelers, they can face to another issues. For instance, the reduction in air travellings will make people to another sources of transportation like trains or buses, which wastes are also hagard for the planet.
On the other hand, even if the government decide to lessen air travellings, it is rather difficult to define to consider the unnecessary. It is which ones crucial to take into account all the circumstances of each individual case. For instance, if for one person business traveler does not make a sense for another it may play a significant role. As the result of this trip can effect on lives on many people. 
To sum up, inspite of hudge changes of air pollution and global warming, governments should not the number of air travels because after minimize solving this problem, the new one will arise. In my opinion, people find another sources for radical solution must of such issues.
