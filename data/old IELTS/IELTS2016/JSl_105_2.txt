In common today a lot of international organization move their businesses to undeveloped countries. Also, the employ local workers. Some people think that advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages, others prefer the another point of view. I suppose that moving businesse in developing countries has a lot of advantages. First of all, there are a lot of poor coheres in the world, where there are not any industries. That is why the big companies must use this countries for their business. For example, in India there are a lot of workers, but in the country rise the unemployment. Moreover, I believe that developing countries according to work force have a lot of resources. More scientists were born in poor countries and there they took their knowledge about environment. The poor country always a rich because it has a great variety of natural resources. For example, international companies can use such poor countries such as Africa, India and others. Furthermore, I agree with the former, because I believe that all countries in the world must help each other. If there are poor cities and developing countries, their neiborhood form developed countries can spend the investment to this countries. Thus, the unemployment in developing countries will decrease and people will have job. However, the other point of view suppose that, this development has some disadvantages. For example, some international organization can use the work force of population and donâ€™t pay for it. Unfortunately, there were a lot of situation in South Africa when companies used the children and women for work in the factories. According to this, I totally agree that international companies must move their businesses to developing countries, because it has a lot of advantages. The poor countries need the opportunity to work. Also, the poor countries can become developed, with help of international business.
