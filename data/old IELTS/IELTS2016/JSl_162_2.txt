The process of globalization lets business spread around the world – from developed countries to poorer ones. Companies, appearing in new places, involve locals in their work. In this essay, I am going to discuss positive and negative sides of the tendency and explain why I think it is good. Talking about advantages of the process, the first thing coming in mind is that international companies provide good places for ordinar workers and professionals reducing unemployment. Also, people from developing countries get an opportunity to become a part of a great system of international business which can lead them to the higher level and open the world for them. However, while bringing these opportunities with them, foreign companies also cause problems for countries they come into. Thus, economics of the hosting states suffer as money flow outside through the international business, decreasing GDP. What is more, local companies find a new strong concurent which they probably cannot handle with. This appears to be a great problem for both economics of the country and workers who lose their workplaces in crushed industries. Nevertheless, these disadvantage seem oversized to me. Examples of different countries of the East or Africa show mostly positive    consequences of international business invasion. Having a big company in their city, people get motivation to study better to receive qualified education and enter this business. Moreover, companies from the “big world” provide production of high quality and standarts. As for me, all these advantages cover, big disadvantages of international companies’ spreading around the developing world, and I find it really positive for some countries to let foreign business stay in their cities.
