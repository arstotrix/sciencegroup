In our modern world there are so many people, who use an air travelling service for business and leisure purpose. This fact provides the increasing damage to our environment. So, nowadays the problem of global warming is highly important fro world’s security.
On the one hand governments have to reduce the amount of air travel by introducing new laws. This is quite effective, because a government is like a big brother for people, who want everything to be alright and safe. So, our planet is like a huge house for everyone, it has it’s own environment, and it is our duty to make house clean and comfortable. But new laws which decrease the amount of air travels may provide some problems for people, who really need to visit other countries by aircraft service. We can not just tell them that they will not arrive other coast for make some business deals, because in Alyaska the water level is grothing every second you fly at the plane.
On the other hand aircraft companies should provide new technical features to decrese the pollution. For example lots of modern cars have “eco-standart” in technical passport. So air companies may do the same. This way is less agressive and solid for businessmans and infinite number of travellers. Still lots of unnecessary transfers via airplanes are growing. It leads to increasing air pollution and as a result to high temperature of the environment. I prefer the second way, to decrease air pollutions for better life of new generations.
