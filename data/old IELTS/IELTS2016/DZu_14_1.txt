The chart illustrates the amount of children who did not have an opportunity to get primary school education over a twelve-year period. The information is sorted out according to gender and region. The horizontal axis shows the region (Africa, South Asia and rest of the world correspondingly), while the vertical axis depicts the number of children measured in millions.
Overall, what stands out from the chart is that the amount of children without access to primary school education was declining over the period in question. This positive trend took place in every region. It is interesting to note that it was the South Asia in 2012 with the least amount of children without education. On the contrary, Africa in 2000s has the hugest proportion of such children, comparing to other regions.
Looking at the details, over a twelve-year period the amount of uneducated children declined in Africa with boys who made up 14,5 and girls who made up 18,2. The general figure in 2012 was equal to South Asia in 2000. However, in South Asia the amount of children without education plunged to 2012 (the amount of boys and girls was almost equal). In terms of rest of the world, the same trend took place and proportions of boys and girls were almost equal (7,7 and 7,6 respectively).
