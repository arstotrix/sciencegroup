Nowadays, many organizations which care of the environment of the Earth claim that the climate is seriously changing and urgent measures have to be taken. There is a opinion that travelling by planes contributes a lot to the burning problem and that the number of air journeys on leisure and business purpose should be cut down and controlled by the government. Personally, I do not share this point of view. In my essay, I will introduce some arguments for my opinion.
First of all, there exist numerous factors that affect the current situation and air travel is not the one. There are other means of transport which use coal and oil as fuel. They are cars, trains and ships. Statistics say that the fumes these vehicles produce dramatically influence the climate, so air travel industry is not responsible for all the evil. As it is known, some air companies have started to introduce new types of planes that do not pollute the atmosphere so much. For instance, Richard Branson, the head of Virgin, was the first who began to work out such projects.
What is more, the sphere of services production and goods also contributes to the problems of climate change and global warming. Many huge plants still use coal and gas instead of electricity to maintain the production cycle. In order to reduce the effect of factory fumes governments have already implemented laws that restrict the amount of fumes exhausted. However, these limits are often surpassed and these measure do not help so much. In other words, the fumes of factories are the first problem to tackle.
In a nutshell, there are several factors that make air and atmosphere deteriorate. Consequently, travelling by air is not the greatest one and many private companies have already started to do something to solve the problem. Ro my mind, no restrictions on the amount of air travel are needed.
