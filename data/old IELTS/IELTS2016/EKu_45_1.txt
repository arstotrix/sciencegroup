The graph given in the task represents the investment in the renewable energy all over the world over 8 years. It has information about developed countries, developing ones and as the world total. The main feature that can be seen is firstly increasing of investment in both types of countries and then falling down. The investments from developed countries are always bigger than from developing ones. But in the beginning of comparing all of them were not high. From 2006 to 2008 the level of investment was slowly rising. The period from 2008 to 2009 was steady: only a slight decreasing in 3 $Bn in the world can be noticed. But then total level has jumped to its maximum level, which was reached in the 2011: world total investment was 279 $Bn (100 $Bn from developing countries and more than a half from already developed). After it, until 2013 the number of investment has begun to decrease dramatically: at the end of this period world total investment was 214 $Bn.    All in all, during this period the quantity of investment o renewable energy has grown up more than in two times.
