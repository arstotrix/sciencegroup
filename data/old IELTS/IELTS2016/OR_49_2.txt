Today develop of technologies and transport allow people to use different hind of trone and have travelling at the air, at the sea and even undeground. But not always all kind of transport are savefully for environmental and for atmosphear. Such as kind of transport is air transport. Our time allow use progress and how even air travel, but and this kind of transport unfortunately dangerous for atmospear and enviroment. For example, such kind of transport can influence on ozon in the atmophear and it can influence on global warming and create air pollution. In the link with this fact governments should introduce laws to reduce quality of air travel for leisure or business. A agree this this idea. Because, at first, not always we so strong need in such kind of transport and some people, who use them even often can decrese their air travel. Secondly, all humaniy is depend for consistense of atmosphear and can suffer for cause of such huge quality of air travel, plants, birds over animals should have clean air. Thirdly, today our planet face to serious problem of global warming, wich can appear for couse of a lot of quality of air travel. Govermant should pay attantion to problem of air transport because our planet need in care. Of course every country should think about decrease of quality air transport and air travel. And goverments have to create law, that give not opportunity of air travel without necessary.
