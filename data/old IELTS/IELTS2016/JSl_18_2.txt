There is an opinion that air travel has been proven to well-contribute pollution and global warming. Governments have to introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure, as a big part of air travel is unnecessary.
Firstly, limitation of air travel might have a positive impact on personal finances as plane tickets prices are usually high. Alternative means of transport might help people optimile their expenses which, in its turn, will contribute to the government’s economy.
Moreover, flights are dependent on many factors, including weather, security, e.t.c. for this reason great number of scheduled flights end up cancalled positioned which causes inconvencience for passangers. Restriction of air travel in this sense will make flight schedules more stable. To sum uo, I think it’s very important to develop air travel on any way, improve every servises to safty of everybody, and we have a lot of chanses to realize this.
