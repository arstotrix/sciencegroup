It is believed that planes produce harmful gases and in this case terribly pollute our environment. For that reason, authorities want to make laws to harden air travelling for business or entertainment uses.
On the other hand, fuels that planes produce can damage our planet, react badly on population’s health. Moreover, nowadays millioners or politicians are used to use air traveling not in important activities. For them, plane or helicopter is an usual sort of transport that can be expluatated to go to the luxury doubled harmful impact of airplanes to our environment. In these reasons, of course, air travel should be reduced or forbidden.
But on the other hand, it is known that plane s the safetiest type of transport. There is lower level of accidents involving this type of travelling compared with cars or ships. Furthermore, going by plane is the fastest way to achieve every corner of the world. However, it is not so cheap like train, it provides comfortable facilities and confidence that you will not be late. So, the fact of reduction the amount of air travel will definitely go to transport collaps. It leads to people’s disappointment and unsatisfied reaction to government decision.
All things considered	, I find that law unaproppriated and without any chance to exist. Modern society depends on daily migration, travellings and so on, so it is hard to imagine that this huge number of flights ill be delighted or cancelled. May be, the possible sollution is in scientists’ hands, because they can invent new energy for planes that could be not as harmful as it is now.
