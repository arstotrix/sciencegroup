In this essay I want to explain positive and negative aspect of this issue. On the one hand, we have enough motivation to say that it is idea to move businesses to poore countries. People from the same country as a company change to get a job in international company. Moreover we cannot to be shure that the products will be a good quality.

Secondly when the main office allow in the country at and the product produce in another country it very difficult to control all studies of process. Thirdly economice of country from which company is lose  lot of money, because company pay taxes in another country. On the other hand, we cannot ignor this moment that developed countries must help to developing countries. In developing countries people don’t have opportunity to find a good job. International companies take this opportunity. Also it has a positive side for company. In developed countries people force coast more than in developing countries. Therefore, companies can safe money and help to people. To sum up, we cannot exactly say that advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages.
