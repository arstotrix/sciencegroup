The chart represents connection between number of childrens without access to school and region of world in 12 years between 2000 and 2012. Biggest decrease in no educated childrens was in South Asia, amount of girls with no education dropped down more than four times and boys more than two in 2012. Rest of world has 8 million less childrens without access to school, than in 2000. Some situation in Africa, but in % compare rest of world has better dynamic. Because both of the regions improve stats for 8 mill, bit Africa has more childrens, with no edication in 2000. So, two general trends in the world, compare to this chart: quantity of childrens with no access to school decreases and compare boys/girls also become smaller, just in Africa. It seems to be approximately the same. To sum up, in all regions trend is positive biggest progress has South Asia and worst stats has Africa. Gender pyramid becomes closer to 50/50 in all regions, not including Africa.
