In the world of modern technologies people get used to air travelling as the most convenient way of transportation despite the fact that it has rather negative impact on the environment. That is why some people claim that regulation of air travel by law will remedy the situation. However, others disagree and say that the goal is unattainable. To my mind, an attempt to pass the law which will reduce the quanity of air travel for particular purposes is not going to be successful due to many factors. Firstly, it might be difficult to determine which reasons are appropriate for flying. Consequently, this list will be open and some people will insist on acknowledgement that air travelling is essential for their current conditions. Secondly, authorities may not blocks rights and guarantees of humans, so this kind of changes of national legislation will not be approved by international law. Nevertheless, out nature continues to be pressed by human activity and our society need to overcome this hurdle. One of the possible ways out without interference in the sphere of law is invention of sustainable plains, for example, those that will not affect air quality. If we still talk about the legislation, governments could prohibit usage of plains that detrimentive to ecosystem. When all is said and done, it can be mentioned that there are various solutions of the issue of worsening environment because of air travel. I do strongly believe that reduction of the latter by public institutions will not be of much help and other remedies can be taken into consideration.
