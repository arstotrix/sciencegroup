In the cart from the task we can see how many youngers do not have chances to educate in different regions and how this quantity has changed over 12 years from 2000. Also numbers devided into gender groups.
It is clear from the chart that more boys and girls who do not have access to primary education were from africa, in 2000. It is because this country isn’t so industrial, as other in the world. Also we can see a decrease of this number after the 12 years, but it became the same, as in South Asia in 2000. Dramatically fall of quantity of uneducated children in South Asia described by the development of this world site. Everywhere in 2000 girls more than boys do not have the chance to have education. The main idea has changed: girls can do clever work as boys in future, not only “house work”.
Nowadays, africa and South asia - different territories if we look at their number of uneducated persons. Rest of the world has decreased this quantity, but can not follow the development speed of South asia.
