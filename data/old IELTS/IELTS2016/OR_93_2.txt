Nowadays air travel became the most popular way of travelling, - it is more faster to go somewhere that is far from you by plain than by car, train or ship. Unfortunately, air travel has a great influence to the environment and some people suggest to set up the laws and rules that would limit the air travel. I disagree with this point of view. First of all, I think that this idea will not have a popularity among authorities as companies that provides air travels pay high taxes that depends on the profit of the ir business and the profit depends on demand of air travel. So, governments will not reduce the number of air travel by establishing laws because it is not profitable for them. Moreover, I do not believe that establishing law is effective way of solving different ecological problem. It seems to be only one decision â€“ to improve transport, making it less harmful for the environment and for humans. People today are on the level of development when most of natural borders are acrossed but many scientist and engeneers works for commercial companies and creat unnecessary and unimportant thing such as supersof toilet paper or water proof cloths for dogs, but the goal of saving other hous Earth is more significant althoug it is more difficult. Furthermore, air travel is one of the achievements of the humanity that made our life easier. It is clear to see that nobody will not support the idea of limiting it. All in all, we should reduce not air travels that is the cause of air pollution and global warming but the amount of the harm that produced by air travels.
