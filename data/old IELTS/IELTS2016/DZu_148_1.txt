The chart contains information about number of children who are not accessed to primary school education in Africa, South Asia and rest of other countries in 2000 and 2012. The data is shown for both genders separately. Units are given in millions.
Overall, number of children without access to the education change from 2000 to 2012 is significant in all regions. Also, girls have lawer rate of accessment comparing to boys in all regions in both years (except “Rest of World 2012” bar). Furthermore, the difference in the numbers by gender is lessens with time in all regions.
Despite everything, the change from 2000 to 2012 is valuable for South Asia (about 22 millions change) while in Africa and other regions difference is not that big (approximately 10 millions change for Africa and 7 millions change for Rest of world).
Although, South Asia shows the biggest difference between two years, the sum of number of children without access to the education counting both years is smaller for rest of the regions then for Africa and South Asia (about 30 millions for Rest of world, 40 millions for South Asia and approximately 70 millions for Africa).
