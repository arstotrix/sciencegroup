The problem of ecology is very important for modern society. The situation with different kinds of pollution and global warming has already become the mainest theme for worring of governments of all countries.
Air travel is also important part of our life. We live in centure of global communications, and, for example, I can not imagine my life without air travel. It is unique opportunity to visit family or decide problems in business, because it is very fast. Speed is the mainest advantage of such travel. If we begin to compare it with train travel, for example, we see that people spend more hours or even days, travelling by train. So if governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel, it must limit only travel, which way is no more than one day. Also the post line or other line with baggage can more by special trains or cars. It may reduce negative effect on the atmosphere.
Besides, the scientists of whole world think about new eco oil, which could allow people to travel with comfort and fast without any limit. It would be good solving of this probleme.
So, I think, that air pollution and global warming is very important problem, but it is not necessary to solve it by such way.
