The chart depicts the difference between the quantity of children unabled to get primary school education in 2000 and 2012 devided into groups by gender and region.
The most striking feature of the chart is the dramatic dicrease in number of South Asian kids lacking the access to primary school education (from nearly 33 millions in 2000 to 10 millions in 2012). Overall, it can be noticed that the biggest quantity of children without ability to enter the primary school was in Africa in 2000 (almost 45 millions of kids).  However, in 2012 this number reduced to approximately 33 millions. Taking into account relation between the quantity of boys and girls it should be considered that only in Africa the level of boys having no ability to get primary school education is higher than of girls.
To conclude, the main trend of the chart seems to be rather obvious: troughout the years the number of children without access to primary school education was gradually falling.
