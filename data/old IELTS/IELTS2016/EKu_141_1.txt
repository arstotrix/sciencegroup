The graph indicates changes in worldwide investment in renewable energy from 2006 to 2013 in developed and developing countries and as a world total.   An immediately notable issue is that both developed and developing countries as well as the world total have almost the same dynamics in their data. Nevertheless the amounts of money invested are constantly the largest worldwide, which is obvious. Then follow the developed countries and the developing ones constantly invest the smallest amounts of money in renewable energy, according to the graph. Therefore the peaks of the investments were reached in 2011 for the world total along with the developed countries, which is approximately 279 and 175 $Bn relatively. Meanwhile the developing countries reached their maximum in 2012, which is slightly more than 100 $Bn.  The average tendency, reaching the maximum points in 2011 and 2012, declines afterwards to the amount of 212$Bn worldwide, approximately 125 $Bn for developed countries and about 90 $Bn for the developing ones.   Here I finish my report
