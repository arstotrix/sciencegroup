It is generally acknowleged that the development of the dimocracy gives woman a chance to be equal with the men in all kinds of questions and spheras. Nowadays, woman want and they are able to work and study in every sphear they choose. Therefore, it is widely stated that in every subject should be included the equal numbers of male and female students.
Let us consider the advantages which society got from this kind of equality. Firstly, woman and men have different mental structure, therefore, the work will be done more effective in case of their couple work. The research shows that men see an overall strategy and main task better than woman while woman are more attentive to details. Secondly, studying together woman and man can develop in a wider range of skills, for instance, man can interestingly teach women some sciences like chemistry while woman can help man with the linguistic subjects. In contrast to these advantages, there is a disadvantage. Studying together female and male students spend too much time and attention on attrection of each other which badly affect on their studyings.
To sum up, I would like to point out that all items written above work from time to time. It is implied that there are situations when the sex of students is meaningless and there is no difference in effectiveness of number male and female students. For example, there is no big difference in the qualification of man who had studied the economy with the woman and of one other who had done it without them.
