Nowadays, producing goods in developed countries has become expensive due to various costs. This is the reason why many companies tend to move the production to developing countries, where the workforce and resources are cheaper. Some people argue whether it is a negative or positive trend. First of all, moving business to poorer countries allows companies to spend less money on the production, which could make the goods cheaper. Secondly, factories located in the developing countries offer people places to work. It is especially important for the countries where the numbers for unemployed people are high.  However, there are some disadvantages. Firstly, the quality of goods produced in the developing countries can be rather poor, because the workforce does not have appropriate qualification and education very often. Secondly, the companies may treat the employees badly, not paying them salaries ot forcing them to live in terrible conditions. This is the question of human rights which is often raised by various public communities. Moreover, the opportunities to improve the technology used on the factories in the developing countries are rather limited. Finally, there are higher costs for transporting goods from these countries to other places, because the developing countries are usually remote from the main company's market. To sum up, I would like to stress that there seems to be more disadvantages than advantages of moving business to poorer countries and we should be aware of the problems this trend could possibly cause in the future.
