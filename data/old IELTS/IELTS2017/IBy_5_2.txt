Genes codes which we recieve from our parents make every person uniq and have a great impact on out personality. However, does it has the greatest influence on us or there are some other sources which make ourselfs who we are? That goes follow, I am going to write about what is more important in my opinon in human's selfestablishing.
To begin with, I would say that the main characteristics that we have since we were born such as gender, race or nationality without doubt have a great influence on our lifes. But at the same time, I suppose that sociolization is much more important cosider to  people's personality and the way they would behaive in future such institution at sociolization as family or school impact on many aspects of our lifes.
In addition to this, in society there are rules and norms people have to led to so natural characteristics are framed. We could not do something that is out of laws just because we want it.
To sum up with. I would like to say that despite the fact characteristics we were born with in some cases influence on our future decisions I find sociolization as the key thing in people's personality building.
