There is an information dedicated to underground railway systems, which are located in 6 cities: London, Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles. Further, in columns there are data about date, when it was opened, the length of route, and number of passengers per year.
In fact, on of the most modern subways in Kyoto has the least number of passengers and has the shortest route: 11 Kilometres. In Contrast, the London subway is also the oldest one in the list and it has the longest route, which is near 400 km. The London subway has the middle position in passengers per year column with 775 millions, then at the same time Tokyo metro is used with about 2000 million passangers per year, which is the maximum value in the list.
Notable, that there is the slight trend: the more older subway is, the more longer the route is. The exception of this rule is the Kyoto, which older than LA's subway, but has shorter route.
Summarising, the oldest subway is located in London, the most recent: in Los Angeles. Furthermere, the only trend here is: the oldest subways have the longest routes
