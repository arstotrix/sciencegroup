According to researchers, personal natural abilities have the greatest impact on any persone development and character and there is no matter what kind of experience that person will get – the specialities he born with will be stronger. 
In my point of view this statement has it’s own strong sides. For instance, there is no doubt that no one can become the increadible singer (or any other of art-sphere) if there is no talent. The success in cultural field can be exeeded by different means – social networks, money, unmoral deals (it’s all about lifetime experience), but the quality of this success is much lower than in case of natural gifted man.
The same issue is in terms of body abilities and sports. It is undisputable that every single child has their own “characteristics”, f.e the level of health, the immunity to deseases, the power of muscles. The problem is even if the weak kid will try to improve his own health or strength it will leds only to the average standard meanwhile the child with great indexes can achieve unbelievable goals.
Another question is about brain activities. According to statistics there are significand differences between man’s and woman’s brain functions, as far as between different peoples (for instanse there is an opinion that in Africa the level of logical operations is lower than in Europe or North America). Furthemore the researches of memory make a strong point about the nature of this phenomenon. The brilliant memory can’t be the product of practice.
In conclusion I should mentioned that it is the interesting problem to discuss, but I trully believe that shaping the personality and developing skills are based on natural abilities.
