It is a common opinion that sport is one of the ways to improve health. However, not all people support this idea, because they think that there are other more effective measures to maintain the health of the people.


In my opinion, sport facilities can have a certain effect on health level of the society. It is true that sport prevents people from negative effects, such as obesity, but it can not cope with cancer or AIDS. And there is no scientific proof that sport helps to prevent regular diseases. Generally, the sport and sport facilities are necessary for the public, but sport should not be regarded as a multi-objective healthcare subject. Yes, it will prevent a person from having a heart strike, but, as it is before mentioned, the range of the correlation between sport and general preservation of diseases is to small.


What is more important, to my mind, is how to prevent the children the children mortality and children diseases. Many diseases which a child can catch when he is young, can affect his health for the whole life, because the disease can learn how to cope with the immune system, so children are more defenceless to this issue.


There are few more ways to maintain the level of the public health. It is important to have a proper nutrition, e.g eating only natural food, and restrain from taking alcohol, tobacco, fast food, salt and other potentially dangerous products. Also, vitamins are worthy taking them because they help to balance all processes in the human body.


In conclusion, it is important to say, that not only sport is important, but the general health culture is what may help the society to stay fit and not to get sick.
