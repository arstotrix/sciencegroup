Probably, such scientists' predictions will not be realized because the previous years trends indicate another tendencies. According to researches, the proportions of elderly people in population are much more higer in comparison with 2020 or earlier trends (about 25% in 2030 and 5-15% in 2000 respectively).
Analizing the information shown, it should be mentioned also that in the USA and Sweden there was a upword trend in percentage  of people which are 65 years old and over from 1940 to 2040. As for Japan, some fluctuations can be observed on the graph. There was a decline from 1940 to 1960, but a rising of level of elderly people can be seen from 1980 to 2040. Japan is assumed to be a leader in such percentage after 2030 year.
