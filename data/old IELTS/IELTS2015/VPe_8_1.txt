It can be clearly seen from the chart that there is downward trend for getting education because of interest in the period from 26 to 49 years old. The difference between two reasons for education is also very significant. From persons around 40-49 years old these figures are the same whereas for them who is over 49 studying because of interest is more important. According the chart presented information about employer's support it depends on a certain age of workers. Approximately 70 per cent of general public under 26 can be sure to get it. This figure plummets with ages but for people over 49 there is a marginally smaller increase in this. 
To conclusion, it can be clear that personal preferences influence on working choice.
