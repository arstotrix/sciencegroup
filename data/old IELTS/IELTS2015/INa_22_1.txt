Writing task 1.
   The pie charts show us the age dates of population in two countries: Yemen and Italy. Moreover, we can chance to see the predictions about it on 2050. What is the difference between these graphs? 
   First of all about Yemen. There is a very big part of chart about children (0-14) years. In 2000 it was more than half and in predictions about 2050 it will be about one third. Social scientists say that it is a characteristic of traditional community. The evidence of this meaning is the fact, that part of old people (60+) is too small: 3, 6% in 2000 and 5, 7% in 2050. Of course, if we will base on these charts, we will can say that Yemen tend to industrial community, but that process is too slow.
   Secondly, there are Italy’s measures. We look at part of people. In 2000 it was about 25%, at the same time, according to predictions, in 2050 it will be else more – 42%. It says us about existing industrial or post-industrial community in this country. A little piece of children is the evidence of this fact.
   Overall, we see two tipical examples of tradition and non-tradition community, which determine by piece of these charts.
