There is an opinion that talanted people should have an opportunity to share their ideas with the society using any way they want. However, others believe that some kinds of art should be restricted by the state authority.
I agree with the first point of view. First of all art, as everything else, is changing with time; modern pictures, music and films sometimes can seem a bit strange or even dangerous only because they are new and we did not get used to it. Thus, any form of art should be restricted, because it provides its following development.
What is more, not everyone can realize the greatness of art, which had been done by modern creative artist. Thus, government should not be allowed to forbide some movie or galary, just because they don't like or understand it. Art is beautiful in its diversity, even if some people can not enjoy it.
In contrast, some politics believe, that definite films and books can be restricted if they pronounce ideas and points of view, which do not correlates with a government policy. However, in such state, in which government says people what to read, watch or even think, there is no rule of law, no freedom of speach and so on. Thus, in my opinion, such forms of governing, not expressing ideas should be restricted.
To sum it up, I believe that every creative artist should have an opportunity to express his talent in any way he wants to. In that case, art will be developing and our life became more beautiful.
