The bar chart illustrated the flactuation in the duration of conversations by phones in the UK.
We can see that number of minutes of telephone calls by local-fixed line more that duration of others type calls. Duration of calling by mobile phone slightly increased between 1995 and 2000. In 2001 number of minutes by mobile phone sharply went up to 40 billions. Moreover, calls by national and international-fixed line significantly rose from 1995 to 2002.
It should be mentioned that local-fixed line calls reached the top in 1999 and had 90 billions minutes. After 1999 total number of local calls started to drop and dicreased  to 70 billions minutes of calls. Number of minutes of calls by mobile were less in 14 times that local-fixed lines calls in 1995. To conclude I would say that total number of minutes in billions by telephone local-fixed line calls in the UK was the leader at this industy.
