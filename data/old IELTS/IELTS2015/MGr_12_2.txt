Some people strongly believe being happy has the big importance for everyone in the world. They give the special significance to this term being sure that the happiness has the huge influence on our lives. However we consider some personal associations when we can see or hear this word, and finally, it is problematic to give the only definition of this state.
First of all, this happens because all people in the world are different and we have unsimilar needs and values. This means that for a man or woman who lives somewhere in a developing country without any items of communication such as the Internet or mobile set, it would be enough to have only what is necessary to his life. For example, those people who live in Africa need nothing but still water and food, but the habitants of any developed country (the European) are not happy with this, cause they need more.
The second reason is the way the person is grown in. The great role belongs to our parents and the way they mold us, cause the problem is if they give us some values or not, and what kind of values we get. Maybe they put some other impact to the happiness.
To conclude, happiness can be achieved by different ways. It is just depends on the meaning we put in this term. For everyoneit can be a smile of the person he loves, for the others it can be achieved only if they get more money. As for me, happiness can be achieved just when I know what everyone of my family, friends are happy.
