Some people believe that Universitie should accept equal amount of male and female students in every faculty. In our modern world high education became normal and nesessary thing such as school education. Also education system became better and better with every year and that is why many different subject developed in universities, so teenagers after graduating from the school have wide choice of faculty.
On the one hand gender intolerance is one of the reasons why universities should accept equal number of men and weman at each subject. Social intolerance is one of the biggest society problems that says us which jobs allowed only for male or only for female. But after all it will be difficult to find some people which wants to enter “another-gender university”. For example, it is a well-known fact that there are much more female teachers than male, and the main reason that man just don’t want to be teachers. So what gonna happened with our education system at all if university has ten girls and one boy?
On the other hand this decision will break this social intolerance idea in one of the most important aspects of our lives such as work in the neasest future. But after all it is not that easy to find same number of different gender on one subject. People are individual and there hopes and future plans can’t be predicted. So university that take equal number of students will not have enought students to keep exist.
In my opinion, I totaly dis agree with this extent, humanity shouldn’t forget about human individuality and creare such extra-tolerance ideas which can easily block our future and high education possebilities. I believe that in our modern society we have good opportunities and nothing is need to be changed.
