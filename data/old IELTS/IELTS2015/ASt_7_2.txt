Nowadays, when democracy and freedom is a number one priority among leading countries of the world, and the question of its effectivnes is a very popular topic to discuss, moder society needs to state borders of how far can creative people are able to go in expressing their feelings and ideas.
To start with, lots of people say that it is neccessary for government to apply a number of restrictions towards products created by artists. The main idea of this point of view is that some actions or words or products can harm other people's feeling in a very dramatic way causing agressive moods in society. Whta is more, if creative proccesses are left uncontrolled the quality of such processes can decrease a lot.
On the other hand, a part of society claims that all kinds of art and people's expressions should be totally unrestricted and all borders are needed to be erased. For example, it is said that the main point of any artwork is to express author's feelings and if an author is distracted by restriction he cannot do it in a proper way.
As a conclusion, it needs to be said that there have to be some kind of a golden middle: some borders are defenitely needed to be set in case of preventing abusive content seen by different groups of people or inappropried things shown to children, but the room for creative processes is still need to exist. Moreover, if the society is able to find and maintain this balance, the quality of our generation's culture will soar up.
