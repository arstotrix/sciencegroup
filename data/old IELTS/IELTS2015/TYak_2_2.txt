Theese days a number of schools are experiencing significant problems concerning their students behaviour. It turns out to be a tough challenge, still there are some solutions that can improve the situation, caused by different personal background.

	First of all, I reckon that school administrations have to introduce more extra-classes activities: organise some excursions and small trips to the country for a day or two. This will bring fresh changes in the relationships of the students, make them mingle more and share their interests outside their classroom and help them to be no more bound to strict academical atmosphere.

	Second, it could be useful to organise debates or discussions among students on various topics: politics, science, social problems. Thus, they will jet to know each other better, find out their strong and weak points, realize how their tastes really differ. Being interested and motivated during the process, they will no more tend to solve problems by bullies and fights. Surely, it could be benefisial if tutors and teachers also took part in such discussions, so that relationships between teacher and his student become less formal. This will teach them both to listen to each other and experience mutual understanding despite the generation gap.

	Furthermore, some restrictions concerning bad behaviour could play an important role too. For instance, charge a  small sum of money for swearing in class or extra-classes for fights.

To sum all up, I strongly believe that although on many countries a number of schools experience great difficulties with their students behaviour, it is possible to change the situation by making small improvements step by step, and those misunderstandings and different social and financial backgrounds, that causes these challenges, can be eliminated.
