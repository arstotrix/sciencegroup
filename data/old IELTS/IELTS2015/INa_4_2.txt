   There are lots of argues in our modern society whet it comes to a quastion of how to improve public health. Some people say that the problem is in lack of a sports facilities. Others say that we should pay more attention on other ways to solve the problem that have more effectivnes than sports facilities.
   There is no doubt that if you want to be healthy you have to do sports and I`m not talking about chess , I`m talking about sports that involve physical activities like swimming or running. If you will be jogging every morning  your organism will be stronger. Healthy body contains healthy spirit. So if you will work hard on your training you will think twice before drink another bottle of beer, eat hamburger or smoke cigarette, because it will harm your body and in the next training you will feel less comfortable weether cause of heavy breathing or extra kilogramms in your body. But there is a dark side of a sport that could do harm to your body instead of health.
