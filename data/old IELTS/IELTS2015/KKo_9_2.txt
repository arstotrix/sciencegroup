Public health has always been an urgent topic. Nowadays when peoples health is affected by different dangers, caused by the development of humanity, this topic is especially problematic. Scientists and politicians have quarelled about the best way to improve public health.
Some people think that creating more sports facilities will help, while others don’t agree with it. In this essay I will discuss different opinions.
As it was written earlier, some people suggest building more sports facilities. They state that more people will visit gyms and swimming pools if there will be more of those. For example, it will be more convenient for some people to go to the local gym than to travel to another side of the city and backwards.
On the other hand, some people say that it is all about encouragement, not convenience and availability. They argue that people should be encouraged to visit sport centers and to watch over their health. If it will be so, governments will not have to spend money on extra sports facilities. Money will be spent on the improvement of healthcare and older sport facilities to make them suit the needs of people.
As far as my opinion is concerned, the main target of any social state is to maintain proper level of health and welfare of it’s people. That’s why not only new sport facilities should be created, but new hospitals and medical centers. Then, to suit the number of these facilities, a lot of professional doctors and medical personnell should be “grown up” in the state’s universities. All these methods will help one state to provide sufficient healthcare for it’s people. All in all, public health, the level of which has lowered through previous decade, should be taken care of. If all the policies I have brought up in this essay will come true, the level of public health will increase and with it, nation’s welfare.
