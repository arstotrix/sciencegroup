It is a common fact that in many schools all over the world teachers and other school workers have various types of problems with people behaviour. Not all schools have any problematic students, but children always can bring some problems.

First of all, these situations often arise not because of teacher’s wrong behaviour. ther are many reasons of this. Firstly, all children have unstable phsicology. So, it means that they not always understand what they are doing. For example, pupils always say bad words to teachers, try to be show themselves as “cool guys”. Secondly, a child’s background is really matter. I mean that family of pupil plays a key role. Some families can be really bad families, it means that children grown up in bad conditions, so it effect on his behaviour.

On the other hand, I think that all problems could be solved. So, big part of it depends on teacher’s behaviour. To my mind, teachers should be really wisdom, because it is very important to try to make pupils better. Teachers are not allowed to get nervous, their behaviour should be opposite to teacher’s. instead of being nervous they should have stable mental system. More than that, some special organisations should control bad families. Family is the most important social institute, and somebody should control it.

To sum up, I think children’s behaviour is really hard to understand and it costs to some schools many problems with it, but through family or good teachers we can avoid such problems.
