Nowadays schools all over the world face different problems relating to student behaviour. Teachers don’t know how to solve these problems, such as fighting at school, not being attentive to the teacher’s instructions, talking during the class, playing games on mobile phones and etc.

The first problem is that children are not well prepared for school by their parents. It is probably because of they are not that strict enough, they allow their children to do whatever they want. From the early age parents should be more open with their children, give them examples of their life experience. Thus they can teach their kids what is wrong and what is right to do.

The second problem is the methodic of studying at schools. Teachers always think that they can treat the students like their own, but in a wrong way: shouting, punishing, giving bad marks, but they don’t have the right to do it.

Another problem that can cause students’ bad   behaviour is the lack of activities which can conctntrate students’ attention, for example, during a break, that can prevent them from running along the corridor or fighting with each other.

There are different solutions to these problems. Parents should spend more time with their children, pay more attention to the problems at school, try to help them with their homework and so on. Teachers should use another tactics to teach students, not to punish, but teach them what is life and which problems kids can face during it. The government should spend more money on equipment, games, playgrounds at school. Thus it will calm down children and make teachers do not have problems with bad  behaviour.
