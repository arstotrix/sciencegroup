Some people believe that there should be equal numbers of male and female abiturients at educational institutions (for the highes education) in each subject.  As for me, I can not totally agree with them, because the interests of both genders are really different.
First of all, it is well-known fact that there are two groups of specialization: human studies and technics. Men are more tend to the second, such as physics, geometry, enjyneering, while women prefer the first one, for instance, literature, art or music, economics. Scientists explain that people have more success in exactly these subjects due to the specific male and female mind.
Moreover, because of this first fact, in my view, it will be impossible to teach equally groups of two genders. There will not be enough stidents in one specialization and even lot in another one. According to statistics there are more women than men in the world, so the equal number of them at universities is an unbelievable dream.
Finally, the government should not accept such system in educational sphere, because, in this case, the youth in country will not be happy and pleased with its freedom for choice. From my point of view, it will lead to dissatisfied population and serious political troubles.
However, I understand that the government is able to make an attempt. It means that some prestigious universities, for example, the main state townâ€™s university, can provide equal places in popular studies for young abiturients. It is possible that this decision will be a good step for improvement of status of a certain subject.
To conclude, I do not believe that equal numbers of both sexes at universities is right for them. They even do not have such opportunity due to modern statistics of world population. On the other hand, of course, some of them can try to accept this law in their educational politics and increase their popularity among young people.
