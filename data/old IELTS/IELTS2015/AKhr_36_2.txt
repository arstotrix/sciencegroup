Nowadays we often see the confrontation between the government and the artists in some countries. This confrontation is often finished by restrictions from the side of government which can be interpreted as violating personal right. In my opinion, the government should not interfere the sphere of society. If the government is formed in a democratic way, it should have no incentives to ban artists' activity because democracy presumes the importance of pluralism tolerance. However, the opponents say that the public opinion can be easily changed by artists who can promote, for instance, for aggression, separation or crime. Therefore, it is dangerous to let artists feel free. I can't agree with such a position. The point I disagree is the way the government opposes some artists. Public opinion is the opinion of many individuums, which can decide and think. Thus, the democratically elected government and some groups of interest (for example, artists) should fight for minds of people and let them decide by next elections who were right. If the government interrupts the society in an aggressive way be restricting artists' freedom, it shows that the government does not respect other ways of thinking and it can't be called democratic. Moreover, it implies that the government interrupts the self-regulated process of social development. To sum up, it's important to say that the social self-regulation in the face of artists' activity plays the crucial role in the social development. That's why it is dangerous to ban artists' activity.
