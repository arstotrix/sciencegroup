The table illustrates the data about transport railway system in different cities around the world. The most obvious trend is dates opened of underground railway systems occur approximately in the same time.
In three develop countries, Paris, Tokyo and London, the quantity of passengers is markedly more compare to other three megapolices. We can see strong differences between Tokyo where is the amount of passengers is 1927 persons, however, in Koyoto is less in several times.
Moreover, we can notice the huge distribution of lengh of route. In London, Paris, Tokyo and Washington DC are more significant differences in kilometres of route relative to lengh of route in Koyoto and Los Angeles. In London is 394 kilometres while in Koyoto is only 11 kilometres.
To sun up, the table shows that kilometres of route and the amount of passengers per year depend on date opened of railway system in every city.
