Nowadays there is considerable discussion over proportions of males and females in every subject. Some people think there must be the same number of men and women. Others are sure , it is no need in groups with equal amount students with each gender, and I disagree with this position. The aim of my essay is to show some adventages for my point of view. 
If first of all, it is said that girls and boys have different views on life. So, having the same number of both genders in groups, students can expand their minds by chating with each other. 
Secondly, there are different ways of solving tasks. Some of them can be found only by males , another only by females. In this case, pupils in groups with equal numbers of men and women find out many new ways of dealing with different problems.
On the other hand, some people argue it is too hard too gather a group with the same number of students of both genders. They explain that it will be honest if someone do not enter a group only because it has already gathered all members with current gender. 
In conclusion, there is no doubt that gathering the group with equal males and females can be problematic. However, there more pros in such groups like the chance for pupils to expand their minds and to find out many new ways of coping with life problems.
