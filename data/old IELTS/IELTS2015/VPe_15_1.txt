The charts below show the main reasons for study among students of different age groups and the amount of support they received from employers
The first chart depicts a percentage number of people who study for career or for interest. The total number of people of the age under 26 (80%) study for career. The number of people at the same age, who prefer study for interest is the lowest one, only 10%. But the number of people who study for career has decreased after some years. Only near 20% of people who are over 49 years study for career, but in the contrast, 70% of people at the same age group study for interest.
The second charts illustrates the percentage number of people different ages, who employers support. The total number is near 70%. This amount shows the number of people who are under 26 years. The smallest quantity which employers support is the age 30 â€“ 39 and it is only 35%. 
To sum up, the reasons why people want to study have changes during their lives. And actually, the support of employers depends on the age of people.
