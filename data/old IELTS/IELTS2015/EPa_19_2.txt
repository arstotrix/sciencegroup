Sport is a very important part of our lives, because there is a strong link between our own health and sports activity.
There are different views about problems of sport and health. Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sport facilities. For good understanding for this view I want to give an example. In our community became more and more people who try to be in a good form and they are going into different fittness clubs for getting the ideal form of body, it means, that became more and more sport facilities,, because there is a big amount of demand for them. But there is a bad side of it, for example, mens and womans start drinking different drugs for increasing their strenght and after that their level of health become lower. Others people, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required. I agree with that view, because, I suppose that number of sport facilities would not change the situation with improving public health, because there are onother measures which have a huge influence on human health such as food and environment, for example. And I think if people will be eating healthy food and our government will provide different actions to improve our environment people become more healthy. 
In conclusion, I want to say that, in my opinion improving of natural conditions is more important measure to became people more healthy than by increasing the number of sport facilities, but I can not say that places for training is completely useless, because there are, for example, different swimming pools which help people to rise their health.
