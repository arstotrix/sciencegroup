Sport plays an significant role on our life (owing to the development pf sports facilities) and inherent part of our health. It is said: “Movements are life”. Some people think that owing to sport we can rise the life expectancy, support our health, the other think that it will not help. Let us try to examine both views and settle down this argue.
   People suppose that owing to rising the number of sport facilities we will be healthier, wealthier and strong. It is obviously that if government spends enough money on the sport sector and change the situation with permission and ability to go in for sport, people will be able to improve their health.
   Otherwise, in order to improve the public health it is important not to forget that it is not enough to build new sport stadiums, centers and renew facilities. Furthermore, we should pay attention on the access to these improvements and innovation. What we need to do is to guarantee also health care, and spirit improvements.
   As far as I am concerned, it is really crucial to spend more time, money on the sport activity. Undoubtedly, it will rise not only individual health but as well as public.
