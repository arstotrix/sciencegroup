The question of how to enhance public health has always been one of the most important. There is a number of possible approaches that the government able to introduce. One of them is to increase the number of sport facilities. However, some people state that if this measure is simplied it would have little impact on public health. Advocates of increasing the number of facilities consider this measure to be efficient enough. Increased number of, for example, gyms will contribute to the easier accessability to such sport facilities. For instance, people who want to be fit will not waste their spare time on the road to sport facilities. Therefore, providing the population with sport attractions the government will achieve the goal of healthier generation. However, some individuals suppose that the increased number of facilities is not the sufficient decision enough to be taken. They admit that there is a shortage of such facilities but the government has to utilize a propaganda of healthy  lifestyle. Using modern informational technologies the advantages of doing sport can be wide-spreaded amid the whole population. For example, a simple article in newspaper regarding to the advantages of sport can attract more people to stay healthy. In conclusion, I would agree with those who consider the increased number of facilities to be not effective. To my mind, this approach cannot create strong incentives for people who opt for sedentary lifestyle. Hence, the government should take some more effective actions to improve the situation with populationâ€™s health.
