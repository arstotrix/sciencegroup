It is common knowledge that artists are very especial people. They need love and freedom. And they usually live in their own world. Should government control them or not? It is very interesting question. I think that everyone should know laws. But this is only my opinion. I know a lot of people who can not agree with me. People usually respect creative artists. Their work are very beautiful. Artists can not do it with some noise of negative reaction. And they hate any kind of pressure. So they are able to create only in comfortable places with people which understand them. For example, Lev Tolstoy wrote his novels in really peaceful place in the country, surrounded by his family. It is the only way to create for such men. Firstly, this job is very hard psyhologically. So that people prefer to be along just for rest. And secondly, they really need to consentrate. But there are some people who suppose the opposite. They think that such kind of freedom can lead to anarhy. You can't do whatever you want only because of your profession. They also believe that people of arts often do strange and bad things just to grab the attention. And press write about it with great pleasure. But artists don't understand that they can do really harm to usuall people. As for me, I think all of this is truth. But I also believe that people should use common sense. And the rules of law really must be equal for everyone. And only when we can find some balance.
