Nowadays the question of sex is actual for almost all spheres of society. Universities is not the expetion and the following suggestion is offered: should Universities accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Personally I’m of the opinion that it is not necessary to pay so much attention to this sharing.
Firstly, not all students are interested in some subject identically. For instance, the amount of female students in the sphere of literary, foreign languages or journalistic is always higher than the percent of male students. I study filology and there are nearly 35 female students and only 3 male students on my faculty.
Secondly, there is not always the opportunity to share female and male students properly. It often depends on the demografic situation in the country. For instance, in Russia, where I live and study, there are much more women than men, so the problem of equal numbers of male and female students can not be decided.
Moreover, there is the coherence between the level of intellect and sex. It’s well known that it’s too hard for female to deal with any electronical or ingineering sphere. This fact also illustrates the big amount of men, who work with modern innovations and nucklear research. So, has it any sense to share male and female students in the same proportion?
To sum up it can be said that the question of sex is too actual and there is not one proper answer or it’s too hard to find it. However, in some cases, for instance, in case of universities, we should not exaggerate the impact of feminism and emancipation and should not pay so much attention to the male and female rights.
