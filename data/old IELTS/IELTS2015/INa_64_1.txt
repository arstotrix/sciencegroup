   The charts from the writing task 1 show data about the population of Yemen and Italy deviding on tree aged groups in 2000 and 50 years more in the future.
   Compare charts of Yemen in 2050 and 50 years previous, it seems to be an increase in group aged 15—59 years from 46.3% to 57.3% and in group 60 and more up to 5.7% from 3.6%. The former people aged 0-14 years was half of population, but the latter it will be only 37%.
   Italy’s charts describe a decrease among people older than 15 up to 59 in 15-20% to be precise, but an increase from 24.1% to 42.3% amond the oldest group.
   To sum up, by 2050 both countries will have population compared with 2000. There will be a decrease among children for both Italy and Yemen. The top group will be at the age of 15-59 years old. Italy will have more than 40% of people above 60 years. We see that less people will be born in Italy and Yemen.
