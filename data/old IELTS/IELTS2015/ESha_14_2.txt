Art is a form of creation and there is an opinion that it has to be independent and free from goverment restrictions.


On one hand, there are a lot of moral norms of behaviour and freedom of this. Sometimes artists have to show some disgusting things or art objects and it can have an bad impact on mental health of the viewer. Films, painting may have a lot of violence or sex scence and that may have negative effect on children or people with weak mental health. There was an accident in Moskow where the artist was naked on the Red Square. Not everyone is ready to watch this kind of art expression.


On the other hand there are a lot of new bright art ideas that can lead to the great inventions. Like no one was ready to the cinema and brothers Lumiere thought that cinema art has no future, but right now it is a power industry. So if brothers were supposed to close there little cinemas by government restriction, we would not be able to watch films right now. So the new ideas and the ways to design them should have no restrictmens.


The solution is to have special comitet with independent people, that are very educated artists and are famous and known. They would be able to give right permittions for audience, that is able to watch something shoking. Also, they would be able to support new inventions in art and spred them in the world.


To sum up there is nessesary to keep freedom in art but to control the information  about content and it influence on the views. There should be warnings and relevant explanation of complicated art. These will keep everyone not worried about personal independence , because to see or not to see the confusing or shoking art is also an independence and freedom.
