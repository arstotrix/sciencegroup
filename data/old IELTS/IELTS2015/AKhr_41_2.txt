During the last century art and politics have close links between each other, and there is a actual question whether government should restrict artists. To my mind, creative artists should be absolutely free in their expressions and the government ought to leave them. First of all, according to democratic constitutions which are used in the majority of countries, all people have freedom of speech and they may express their opinion without any restrictions. Thus, artists have possibility to do it on their pictures. Secondly, if tallented artists express their opinion on political world through their pictures, it may be helpful for the government, because artists attract the official's attention to unsolved problem in society and they do it peacefully without weapon conflicts. For example, a lot of painters used caricatures to show for polliticians the public opinion. Moreover, all people may use artists' pictures to stay in harmony and to have a rest of their minds, and no one can stop it. Nevertheless, there is another point of view that the government should restrict  artists' actions and that it is necessary to have a censors in the states. These people consider, that contemporary art may, for example, destroy children's feeling and break there lifes. As I said previously, I'm disagree with this statement. Artists shows their pictures or clulptures in a special places as museums or galleries. Thus people or children can see it only if they desire it. The desicion to visit such place is rational desicion, and the government should not use "frames" for this. To sum it up, to my opinion, artists should have possibility to express themselves without any government restrictions, but they should not break other people's freedoms.
