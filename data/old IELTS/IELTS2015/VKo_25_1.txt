On the current we can see the difference in percentage between males and females, who have a variety of levels of post-school qualifications in Australia in 1999. According to the chart men are more successful in scilled vocational diploma (more than in 6 times than women), in postgraduate diploma (70% against 30%) and in master's degree (60% against 40%).
Speaking of women they get undergraduate diploma in 70%, while males only in 35% of occasions. The lowest position females achieve in skilled vocational diploma (10%), while males in undergraduate diploma (a bit less than 40%).
In conclusion, we can see the trend that shows the bigger amount of high-quilified men, comparing to women. I suppose, it can be explained by the fact that females tend to think about their children, not concentrating on the post-school qualifications.
