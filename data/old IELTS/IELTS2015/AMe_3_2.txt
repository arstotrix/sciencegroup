In our days is becomen more and more people who have their own point of view about all what happen with them or in the whole world. This people often have creative ideas and they want to show them. Sometimes this ideas are not normal for other people. Creative artists, for example, can damage view of city when painting on the whall. The goverment restriction on what they do.
	I think, that creative artist need to know some moral norms and understand that things that they use for their creative and art have a big value for many people. For example, artists have a very original idea and he wish make his idea “alive”, but he doesn’t think what does it means for other people. He paint on the whall of a house that very valuable from historical point of view. The Goverment ring with him. but he doesn’t understand what unnormal and unnatural he done, he just found the way of express his emotions and feelings.
	From other hand freedom of express is very important and nessecary. It is the lifestyle of artists: be creative, be freedom and do what they wont. If somebody stopped them, they can be depressed. Without freedom creative they are like flower without sun.
	In my opinion, artists need to think what they realy need to do and what influense on other people it will have. It help them does not have problems with the goverment. Think before do somethink is a realy good way.
