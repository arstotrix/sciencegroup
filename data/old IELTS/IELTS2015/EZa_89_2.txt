The ideas of creative people such as artists should not be prohibited by anybody including the government in all the spheres of their work. They should be allowed to work without any borders. This problem is worth discussing nowadays.
People who choose creative professions do not look like those who want to become a driver or a banker psycologically. They see the world in another way. And as usual this point of view is essential for the society in general. However it happen that these ideas are not considered to be worth spreading.
There are several countries in the world where democracy has not appeared yet. In that countries the majority of talented people cannot create what they want. For example there is a perspective musical band in North Corea which is prohibited on their motherland because the policy of the country. That group creates masterpieces but is not allowed neither to spread their ideas not to leave the country. They become famous all around the world when a foreign tourist shot their illegal concert and updated it to the internet. It would be good for them to be allowed to leave the country and create the music in a propper way.
On the other hand there are some art studios which produce immoral things such as chawing people without clothes on the wall. This is considered to be breaking the law. If these events were allowed it would have a bad impact on children. 
To sum it up the art should be divided into two parts: one which is for everybody and another one for those who desire have an extreme.
