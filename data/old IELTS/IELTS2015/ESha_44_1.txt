But in Italy it will be almos a half of whole population, while in Yemen slightly less than 6%. The quantity of 15-59 years people in Italy will decrease and reach 46,2%, while in Yemen there is an opposite trend: the amount of 15-59 year people increase and to the 2050 will be more than a half of the whole population. We can also see a similar trend of decreasing in “0-14 years“ group in both Yemen and Italy, but the gap in numbers between two countries is significant.


All in all, despite the nubmerous differencies there are similar tendention in both countries.
