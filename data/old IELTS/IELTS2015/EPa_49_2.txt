Nowadays the problem of public health become sagnificantly important worldwide. Many people all over the world forget about their physical development and health because of whole new set of opportunities which modern time has. People always in hurry and they have to eat in fast food restaurant which negativly affects them. Others meanwhile sit all day in the office or at home spending time in the internet or at work at computer. Here comes the question â€“ how to improve public health?
Some people say that in order to improve public health the best way is to increase the number of sports facilities. They say that due to training in the sport facility people will improve their life condition and stregth their powers and energy. People will visit gyms which will be closer to their own homes, because it will be much convinient then drive to the other part of town. As a consequence in sports facilities will be more free space to give more comfort to a clients.
On the other hand some people claim that sports facilities would  have little effect on public health and that other measures are required. They sure that people which have never been to the gym will not go to train in it even if it will be located near their house. Moreover due to it the population which regulary visit sports facilities will not row so much to cover the cost of opening new gym. 
I agree with the last opinion because to my mind in the first place to increase the number of sports facilities we have to make sure that people are interested in it. It will do a lot of damage to the economy to invest money in industry with low demand on its` services. We have to more effectively use this investment. In that way we can do a survey to ask people to choose from several options of public health improvement and find out which of them will be more useful.
