The average level of health of people seems to get worse as we are now more exposed to different dangers than some years ago. The speed of life increases in order to match technological, cultural and social development so living in big cities we often do not have time look after our organisms properly. We consume fast food, do not do any sport and act carelessly on our physical health. So a lot of people are concerned about what methods are best to use on purpose of the public health improvement.
Over the recent years there has been a huge growth in amount of people doing sport on their own using public sports facilities. Such people learned by themselves the benefits of that kind of keeping the body fit and they are often sure that an increase in the number of sports facilities is the best way to improve public health. 
On the other side, a lot of people tend to doubt in such opinion because just placing the facilities won`t make people do sport or even think about it. In this point, there should be some incentives that will attract new people, or there must be other measures not necessary connecting with sports facilities or even sport itself.
To sum up, it should be said that improving health is a very personal issue for anybody, thus what can be useful for one, may be harmful for someone else. So the effect of increasing sports facilities strongly depends on people.
