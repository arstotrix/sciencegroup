The information illustrated on the pictures is about comparison of age categories in population of two countries: Yemen and Italy in 2000 and 2050 years. 
   As we can see the bigger part of population in Yemen in 2000 year consisted from 0-14 years and 15-59 years old people, while there was only 3.6% of eldest generation. The prediction is that by 2050 year the number of middle generation (15-59 years old group) will increase.
   In Italy is a little bit different situation. In 2000 year the eldest generation occurred approximately a quarter of all population and only 14.3% consisted from the youngest generation. And by 2050 percent of more than 60 years old people will continue to rise and wil be 42.3%.
   All in all, we can say that in Yemen population will be younger and in Italy it is and opposite effect, because population become older.
