Nowadays, the hide education become more and more popular among youth people of bouth sex. Some people think that universites should accept equal numbers of male and female student in every subject. But other think that making equality of boys and girls an faculty is wrong. In my opinion, all students should take part in entring competition, despite of sex. 
All people should understand, that there are only male and only female professions. And that the main goal of university is preparing a good specialists. The society will have a very big problem if we will have equal number of male and female specialists in every professions. For example, if university will prepare equal numbers of profesions. For example, if university will prepare equal numbers of male and female builders, many women will have not a goad job, insted of men, whitch numbers will no enought for good work in this professions. 
Else, equal numbers of boys and girls on a faculty will no right for some people, which will not enter on some subject because of sex. For example, the university accept 30 boys and 30 girls on some subject. And that 31 boys and 30 girls wants to enter on this subject. The ending 31st boy will not enter on subject, because of his sex, just if he will have better exmam’s results that 1st girl, whitch will study in the university.
In conclusion I want to say that there ar  some advantages and disadvantages in bouth sistem of entring in the university. But I’m sure, that male and female should have equal chance for entring.
