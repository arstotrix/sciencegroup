The problem of government's control of culture is not new, but it is still actual, especially in Russia. Some people say that there must be no government control in art, others say that it is possible. I partly agree with people, who say that governmental restriction is evil. On the one hand, people who can create something genious must be supported be the government. Of course, their ideas, expressed in many ways, may criticise government's politicy, but that is not a reason for artist to be out of law. In democratic countries if the writer is not a racist, he can write everything he wants. For example, in Germany was made a film "Khodorkovski", which criticised politicians of Russia and Germany, but it is not broadcasted on TV in Russia, and a director of the film had to make this film in Germany (he is from Russia). On the other hand, censure makes artist create.They have to find different ways to pass the state's control in Russia, there has always been state's control of artist: from Russian Empire tu Russian Federation. And most greatest works of art were created in the period of tough control. Saltuikov-Schedrin, Lermontov, Pushkin - all of them had problems with censure. In USSR, where writers were even sent out of the country for their creations, were written GULAG Archipelago, The Quite Don, Master and Margarite and soon. For every artist it is very important to be not restricted and to be allowed to do whatever he wants. Best states' control of art can cause an artist boom. That is why I can't say exactly that I agree or disagree with people who don't support governmental restrictment of arts.
