Nowadays there are a lot of modern artists in the world that have a need to express their own ideas and feelings. However, people have different opinions about if the government should control what artists do or they can express everything they want in whichever way they wish. To my mind, there should be some restrictions on artists' products. To begin with, all people have different views and values that depend on their culture, nationality, religion. Most people can be hurt if someone says bad things about their values. If the artists express any ideas they want, there will always be artists who can hurt somebody's feelings that can lead to a bad situation in community, to some social problems like national conflicts or the absence of trust to the government. Therefore, in most countries, even in democratic ones, there are some laws connected with the respect of other humans' values. Moreover, any art must not influence children in a bad way. It is easy to influence children, especially through the art. For example, when a child watch a film or play a computer game where people are killed, it makes a child think it is normal. Thus, there are special restrictions on children's films and plays in most countries. To sum up, I think art should bring some carry some values inside, it should not destroy the values. In most countries there is control on what artists do because the government interests in citizens' good psychical health. There should not be any propoganda of suicides or violence in media and art. Nevertheless, artists in some non-democratic countries are often restricted by a strong censorship. In my opinion, there should not be such strong restictions. However, some restrictions should garant the stability in community.
