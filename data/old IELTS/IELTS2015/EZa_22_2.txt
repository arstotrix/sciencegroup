These days, many people are convinced that happiness is the main life goal however I'm not sure the majority of people are happy. There is a plenty of factors which might help us to achieve this purpose and in this essay I would like to highlight some of them supporting with relevant examples.
Firstly, the most important factor is a clear project of what he she tends to name "hapiness ". If the person doesn't have any model of this, he / she will never achieve it because ndeody could reach a goal if the sense of the goal is misunderstood. For example if one woman wants to have a high salary she should write somewhere a certain sum of money she is looking forward - for some people 10$ could also be a great sum and they work round-the-clock to earn them while others are sure that 1000$ is worth of nothing.
Secondly, people should work hard to achieve the goal because if the person does nothing he / she will receive also nothing. People should develop themselves and go further to create the future. The permanent actions and development may give the person a dream on a purpose that could make him /her happy future life .
Thirdly, people should never give in because there could be a number of failures before the only success. The main thing is not to lose the possibility but to use it properly.
To sum up, I'm deeply convinced that happiness is an achieveable goal but people should work hard and not give up this idea, while being on the way to this dream.
