It is argued that sport is a major way to improve social health. To my mind, even if sport actually makes us healthier we can not leave population with that single measure.
To support the idea of wider range of improvements, we need to take into account the general socio-economic situation in the world. Firstly, we can not but agree that relevant environmental situation influences us a lot leaving less air to breathe and dirtier water to drink. To this extent not only people but also governments need to manage the situation and put industries under a strict control. Moreover, we can not skip the fact that smoking became a number-one problem for citizens. The issue is that more people take up smoking while few people cope with giving it up. That is why those who are not addicted to cigarettes are endangered to get harm from second-hand smoking. So, my opinion is that governments also need to do everything to reduce smoking population to increase health. The third argument can be supported by an example. It is noticeable that those countries which have the least medical equipment have a tendency to raise a healthier and long-living population. And this can be the next option on the way to healthier lives. 
On the other hand, it is undeniable that sport covers  a lot of issues of healthier and happier lives. A big range of sporting facilities gives society an opportunity to adjust different live. It s also scientifically supported that any kind of activities make a person more patient and organised as he mixes brain and physical work.
All in all, it is not the only way to improve health by raising the quantity of sports facilities. The best way to achieve this goal is to combine this way with other aspects of governmental and individual care.
