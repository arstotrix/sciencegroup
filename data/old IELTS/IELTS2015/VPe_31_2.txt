It is common knowledge, that one of the most significant problems in contemprorary social life is gender equality. Some people say, that women do not deserve good salary, or better life conditions, or advanced education, but such ideas are against human rights.
One, of the important questions is that, should universities accept male and female students in the same proportions in every subject or not. The question is not simple. 
On the one hand, I agree with the statement, that every person, male or female, deserves full life and joy , good education and job , a chance to get interesting profession. If everyone thinks so, there will be neither conflicts nor problems.
But on the other hand, talking about universities exactly, there are different situations, when total equality in every subject is mingless. For example, there are some subjects that suit only (with the little exeption) for men. There are not a lot of women who are fond of mathematics or physics.
What is more, there is few number of men, who like humanitarian arts. So, I do not think it will be so clever to accept equal numbers of female and male for such subjects.
To make a conclusion, I can say that gender equality is really necessary thing, and human rights is the most important issue in social life. But when the question of equal number of male and female students for each subject rises, it should be mistreated. University education is the mos individual issue, and students are students regardless of their gender. They just should be smart and clever and study such subjects, that really suit them.
