The line graph and the pie chart that are given represent information about the expected electricity expenditure during a day in winter and summer seasons in England and on what consumers needs the power is spent.
It is clear from the graph that the consumption of electric power depends on time of the day. In winter, the demand for electricity increases in the late night hours to approximately 40,000 units at 2-3 a.m; then it declines steadily and at 7-8 hours in the morning makes up nearly 30,000 units. An average comsumption of electricity afterwords increases slowly, but firmly till 22 p.m. (47,000 units), but after that drops sharply by more than 10,000 units.
The situation is different with the demand in summer days. It fells slightly during the first nine hours of the day (from about 17,000 to 13,000 units). Then there is a rise to 20,000 units, it peak at 13-14 p.m. It is followed by a slump to 17,000 units in the evening. After that the demand for electricity levels off and remains the same, but at 22 p.m. drops and then fells gradually.
The electicity is mainly spent on heating rooms and water (more than 50% of the total amount). Other needs like proriting electricity ovens, kettles and washing machines, lighting and TV and radio, typical house instruments all amount to less than 20%.
Overall, these two graphs show the connection between season, time of the day and what the electricity is used for in England. In winter, for example, when the sun goes down very early, the lighting begun to use earlier,  than in summer. Furthermore, it is usually colder in winter days, so itâ€™s necessary to heat up the house and water.
