Given pie charts show percentage of people of different ages based on information from 2000 and predictions for 2050. It can clearly be seen as we look at all 4 diagrams that population in both countries will be getting older. The percentage of kinds and teenagers will gradually go down in Italy and will have a more rapid regression in Yemen. Italy population was already quite older than Yemen`s in 2000. The European country had almost quarter of people in age over sixty, while in Yemen they made less than 4 per cent of total quantity and a little more than a half were in very young age. While not being wery high in 2000, in Italy the percentage of olders will rise almost by 20 percent and will make approximatly 4 times more people than the young generation. Yemen`s majority in both charts consist of people younger than 59 (more than 90% in both cases), and Italy`s majority are people aver 15 years old.
