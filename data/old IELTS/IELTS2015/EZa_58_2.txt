Nowadays all creative professions are excepted to have more space for realization and less rules unlike other kinds of work. I could not agree with this opinion. 
There are several arguments for my point of view. First of all,there are some moral values, which have to be considered. Paintors or filmmakers coiuld damage children's view on the world with the violental pictures or nude bodies. Secondly, employers can pay only for a work, but not for a talent. If a painting is not realy intime it will not be better with the imaqge or idea ina head of its creator. There are some time or space limits which could not be avoid.
My opponents may think that masterpieces won't be born in such strict conditions. There is a blog of famous russian artist Lebedev, where he is writing, that some rules are necessary. His organisation works are well-known, however, there are rules in his company. First of all, he does not care about the time, in what his employees come to work, but there are deadlines and the time restrictions in which the work must be finished. The artists can ware that they like but the clothes must be clkean and nit wierd or outstanding if it can shock others. The work place should be organized differently, like in Yandex. In office they have cookies and couches. However it does not disturbe from work,moreover informal atmosphere help people to generate new ideas. 
To sum everything up, I want to say,that in any job there are rules which could not be avoided, but some freedom in creative professions can lead to the better results.
