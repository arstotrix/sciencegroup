The graph gives information about the proportion of people aged 65 and over from 1940 to 2040 in Japan, Sweden and USA.

It is worth noting that all three trends are upward. In 1990 the proportion of people aged 65 and over was from 5% to approximately 9% in three countries. The proportion of population in Japan fell slightly and then levelled off over the period from 1940 to 2000. At the same period other two countries had an increase in numbers. It is predicted that after 2020 the proportion of Japan’s population will rocket to approximately 27% in 2040, when Sweden and the USA will stand at 25% and 23% accordingly. Overall, it is clear that Japan’s proportion of population has another trend in numbers than other two countries. However, they all have upward trends. The most striking feature of the graph is an increase in numbers of Japan’s population after 2020.
