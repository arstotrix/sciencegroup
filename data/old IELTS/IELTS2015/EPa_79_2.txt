Some people think that improving public health is all about building new sports facilities. However, many people disagree with that. Let`s look into it. 
The approach of building more sports facilities is really straight-forward. Those who vote for it believe that there is a proportion between the amount of people who do sport and the number of stadiums and such. Be that as it may, they thinks it`s the best way. On the one hand, this seems like a nice and simple solution, also because these facilities will be of use to professional sportsmen.
On the other hand, it may not be so simple. First of all, because in order for these facilities to run properly, it takes a lot of resources for its staff, maintenance an the energy it consumes. Many people think that this is not cost-effective. They suggest measures like promoting sports, especially outdoors. It is said to be cheaper and more effective to motivate people to do sports by themselves, without necessarily using special sports facilities. Also, they say that it`s very effective to take care of your nutrition, as it has a great influence on the way we feel. 
I personally think that building new sports facilities is a good measure. But certainly not the best. I believe that public health is more than just doing sports. But even if we talk about sport, motivation is much more important than the amount of sports facilities around. The motivation to do sports is what makes people do it, not the stadiums.
All in all, this problem appears to have interesting points to discuss. I believe that a concensus does exist here.
