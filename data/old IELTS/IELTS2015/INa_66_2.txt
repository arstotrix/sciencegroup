   Nowdays, the trend of usage of sports facilities increase in differen health programms. Someone consider that it is very good idea to improve common health with help sports, but other people think that it does not productive, because many people do not whant to engage a sport. Thise essay will look borh sides of thise statements and later I imprese my own opinion.
   Sometimes people do not have enough time for doing some sports exercises, and they do not want to improve their health with help sports. Moreover, improving public health is force many people to do it, but they do not want to do it. For example, many companies can took initiative and ask their staff to go in sport center or swimming pool and it can be caused to bad work, because people will be unmotivated their work. Also, some people can not do sport because their health do not allow them do it, but when they will know about new sports facilities sick people will be sad.
   However, increasing the number of sports exercises are glad for people who like sport. Different type of sport allow them try something new. People consider that it is very good idea, because sport is health. For example, when we go to the doctor, he advise us to do some exercises in the morning, visite swimming pool and so on. Moreover, visite the sport center is good opportunity to look like a pretty person. For example in Russia it is very popular to do sport and it improve health of their nation. They win Olympic games in 2014 because of improving their national health with help of sport.
   To sum up, I can say that it is very good idea to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities, because sportsmen it is always healthy people who have many energy. If we will increase number of sport exercises it does our population more health and happy.
