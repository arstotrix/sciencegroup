There is an opinion that it is good for artists to express their creative ideas in many different ways they like. However, it is useful to let them do freely without any concern of the government.
	We are living in liberty and democracy, so not only artists but also everyone has it’s truly rights to do what they want. Creative artists, in particular, can feel  respected when they have freedom to show their ideas do the world. They may feel people believe in them and always wait to see their new ideas such as words, pictures, music or films. In addition, this feeling can give them motivation which makes them create more wonderful productions.
	Nevertheless, it will be too risk for the government to have no restrictions on what artists do. Some violent and erotic paintings may be drawn everywhere in the streets like walls, park benches and even on the schools. It can be worse. For example, an artist goes to a museum, and he suddenly has a new idea about his new picture. He may draw his thoughts on some cultural heritages. He ignores the rules of the museum because he is free to express his idea in any way. The worst thing is that children can be affected badly by some abstract paintings which the are not old enough to understand.
	In conclusion we need to recognize that artists are creative-personality and they need to get it or the can’t work.
