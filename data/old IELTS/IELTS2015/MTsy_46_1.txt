The ages of the populations in Yemen, as well as in Italy, differ from their projections in the future. Detailed information is presented in the charts.
It is obvious from the charts, that the percent of young people of 0 to 14 years old decreases from 50,1 percent to 37 percent in the period of time around 50 years in Yemen. This information give us understanding about great decrease in the growth of younger part of population in Yemen. In Italy the percent of young people slightly decreases, that is only 2,8 percent of decrease. In comparison, the young part of population in Yemen decreases by 13,1 percent. Speaking about the progress in population that is aged between 15 and 59, who may be called "mature", the percent of mature population in Yemen increases. The decrease in mature population in Italy for that time is considerable, which is about 15 percent. Analysing information about people who are older than 60 years, the decrease of population in Yemen is more considerable than in Italy.
To sum up, while in 2000's there was around half the population of mature people, after a period of time there will be more nature people in Yemen and more people who are older than 60 years in Italy.
