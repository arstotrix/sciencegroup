The pie-charts illustrate us the data about the ages of the population of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and also make predictions for 2050. The population of this countries were derived on three age groups:0-14 years, 15-59years and 60+ years. As we can see, the biggest part of Yemen population in 2000 were people who are yunger than 14, but in Italy were only 14,3% of such peopl at this time. A bit feuer than a half of the Yemen population in 2000 were 15-59 years people, but in Italy were about 61,6% of them. The smallest part of the populations of bouth countries in 2000 were people of 60+ years: about 3,6% in Yemen and 24,1% in Italy. Projections for 2050 are about the increase in quantity of 15-59 yers people in Yemen from 46,3% to 57,3% and decrease in Italy from 61,6% to 46,2%. At the same time an essential growth in the percentage of 60+ years people will be in Italy, but no changes will be there in Yemen. As about the 0-14 years people, their part will be approximetly the same in Italy on 2050, and it will fall on Yemen from 50,1 to 37,0%. So, we can say that the population of Yemen is becoming yunger, while the population of Italy is becoming older.
