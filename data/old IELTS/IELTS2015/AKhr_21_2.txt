Nowadays issues which are related with freedom of expression become more popular in political agenda. On the one hand, government should restrict ability of creative people to express their ideas in their works. On another hand, creative artists should get freedom in each their actions. In my mind, government policy should provide some limitations for activity of artists, because it is significant for development of civil society. Firstly, the restrictions of freedom of expression are needed for defence privacy life of citizens. Sometimes some artists consider that they can disturb interests and private issues of their friends or family. So, they use some facts about them in their arts. By this way they commit a crime against personality. Moreover, some artist's work can break public order. So, they express their ideas through actions which are simillar to vandalism. They paint on museums or architectural buildings. So, they do property damage, and this property is for all people in country. By this way this artist disturb interests of whole society. Furthermore, some restrictions on activity of creative artists can be disturbtion of their personal rights such as freedom of expressions. But if they will do some illegal activity in their arts, it will be necessary to limit their rights. To sum up, the problem of the restriction of freedom of expression it is really significant in modern society. Government should provide policy which will defend the rights and private issues of all people in country, but it policy can restrict freedom of artists if it is necessary for saving people's interests.
