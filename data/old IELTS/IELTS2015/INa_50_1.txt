Task 1.
   To begin with, we have 4 pie-charts in the following task. The charts give us date, which can help us to analyze and compare ages of the population of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and expectations for 2050.
   Firstly, in Yemen in 2000 we can clearly see that the amount of young people of the age from 0 to 14 years old is way bigger than the number of people who ae in the age group from 15-59 years and 60 years and older (50,1 % of 0-14 years in comparison to 49,1 % (15-59 years old + 60 and older counted together)). In the future, by 2050 the group of 15-59 years will obviously become the biggest group because most of young people from the group 0-14 years will eventually grow up.
   Secondly, in Italy we can observe another situation. The biggest age group is a group of people of the age from 15-59 years. Furthermore, only 14,3 % of youngsters are living in Italy in 2000 (group from 0 to 14 years). So by 2050 the population of Italy became older and by 2050 the biggest group will still be the group of 15-59 years, but the group 60 and older will become the second biggest (42,3 %).
   In conclusion, we can make an assumption that Yemen population is young and demographical situation will remain pleasant. On the other hand, Italy will gain lot of old people.
