Nowadays the nesessary part of our life is our health. All people want to be healthy, because without health people become unhappy. Health always should important role in our life. In order to be health people do many things, some people take drugs for health, some people go in different place which usefull for health and some regularly doing sports.
There are point of vies that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Every people who doing sports have a strong character, he is healthier and have respect from other people. Also, I want to say that in our days doing sports is fashionable. There are statistics which shows that more and more people become visit sport clubs and different events which associated with sport. And the best way would be to expand the number of sports facilities. Other people think and say that this would have little effect on public health because among all population there are many old people, which don`t do sports because their health don`t ready to it. By the way old people take place big share of population and their health independ on sports. Also there are ilness, which impossible to avoid by increasing the number of sports facilities.
 To sum up, I want to say that health of every people depend on yourself. I think that the best way to improve people`s health is a constant sport training and desire to live. Every decide what, how and why he should do it. The great words:”Life is movement”.
