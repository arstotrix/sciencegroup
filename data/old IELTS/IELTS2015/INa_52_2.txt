Task 2.
   There is an opinion that the boost of various kinds of sports is the most appropriate way to improve health of nation. Still there are proponents of this idea who argues that there are more effective ways.
   Firstly, I would like to stress that a wide range of sport activities provides us with such a marvelous choice which can fit any type of person and satisfy both physical and psychological aspects of human being. For example, a person with broken leg would hardly ever attempt to running while water activities may help him to relieve his pain. Same situation concerns the one who fears the water. Therefore, such kind of person is more likely to choose tennis or football instead of swimming.
   Secondly, a great amount of sport activities can help mankind to make some difference in their lifestyle. One can try new and astounding types of sports instead of lying in front of TV-set.
   On the other hand, I would like to note that loads of people have job which in connected with physical labour. Thus, by the end of the day they have neither desire nor physical power to go in for sports. More than that, some people simply do not have enough time.
   Still, I deeply believe that any of us can always find a time for some sports and it mostly depends on the level of the laziness.
   To sum up, I would like to say that sport facilities generate vigorous debates focused on the issue concerning the best ways to make nation healthy. I am of the opinion that increasing of the amount of sport types can make our nation healthier.
