Gender problems have always been a very topical question. Nowadays males and females are supposed to have equal possibilities, but it is often noticed that there are more male students studying some subjects, while other faculties have more females. Whether it is a fair situation is an issue worth discussing.
From one point of view, human rights allow ant student to choose what subject he/she wants to study, so it should be so, that the numbers of male and female in every area is equal. Moreover, there are some benefits from a community with participants of different gender – it is known that in such group there are less arguments, tension and the atmosphere all in all is much less aggressive. That in its turn leads to a more productive work and cooperation, which is vital in a studying institution.
However, there is another side to the problem. Is this situation of inequality based only on the preferences of the university or are the very students responsible for it? Usually females prefer to study humanities, while males are more interested in mathematics, therefore some faculties have more students of the same gender. Clearly, it will be highly inproductive to give a place in the university basing only on the gender and not on the person’s abilities and skills.
All things considered, it can be said that the problem of gender equality is still as important as ever. In my personal opinion, trying to accept an equal amount of males and females in every subject is a wrong way to deal with the problem, because then some more talented students can be discriminated because if their gender.
