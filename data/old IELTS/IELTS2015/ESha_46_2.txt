One of the widely discussed issues in the modern world is health care. Some people argue that the improvement of sports facilities will have a great positive effect on public health. However, others claim that this is not the most effective way to improve social health.


I personally agree with the first point of view for several reasons. There is no doubt that the growing popularity of including sport in one's lifestyle encourages people to do more sport. Looking at the adds of new fitness clubs with beautiful and powerful people on them makes people believe that sporting activities will affect their level of happiness and life sutisfaction. That is the reason why more people will join fitnessclubs in case of the improvement of sports facilities.


Furthermore the rise of the number of sports facilities leads to the bigger competition between sport clubs owners, which in turn leads to the improvement of quality of sports facilities and to the reduction of prices. This definitely stimulates people to become a member in fitness club.


On the other hand it is clear that people are not likely to change their daily routine because of the well-promoted fitnessclubs. Obviously, those who are interested in doing sports regulary already do this.


Summarising the ideas I would like to conclude that people generaly tend not to change their lifestyles. However better access to sports facilities with the help of clever promotion will defenately impact on people's attitude to sport. That is why not only a growth of the number of sports facilities is needed to improve public health, but also an extention of the idea of healthy lifestyle.
