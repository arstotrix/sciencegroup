Many people believe that increasing of the number of sports facilities improve public health. However, there are many other people who say that it can not help to improve public health. Who is right? 
Let`s consider this question for all sides. Suppose that the number of sports facilities was increased. But how will we know that people are interesting it? It is can do if make survey people and know thir interests. 
Example: ask children that is their like sport play. And after analysis answers will build sport area for this play. also we can ask other people and increase quantity of sport areas. I think tat it should improve public health.
On other hand many people do not want to engage sport, and like just sit at home. To solve this problem we should make motivation for those people. We should advate sport and sport activity or equpment. Example: boots and clothes for morning running. If people will see on display their TV such, ads they will think that healthy life and engage sports is better than sit at home.
In conclusion I want t say that men self create own life and if he want to be health, will engage sport.
