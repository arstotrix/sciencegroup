Happiness is a kind of very abstract and hard to define noun such as love, friendship or freedom. At that time it is difficult to achieve it too. However a lot of philosophers and psychologists have tried to find a way to happiness till nowadays.
Every human want to be happy I suppose. But every person gives his or her own meaning of and there can be a huge number of factors our happiness depends on.
As for me, I would like to refer to a well-known phrase from a soviet movie: “happiness it is a situation when you are understood”. As human is not only biological creature but a social one, we can not underestimate the significance of communication and being understood and loved.
Nevertheless it is not a single possible reason. A lot of people in modern society warrying about their everyday  needs and just want to have enough money and to be healthy. In Russia there is an opinion that health is the main thing in the life and all other points will be achieved if you are healthy.
To sum up I can say that always we would have our reasons
