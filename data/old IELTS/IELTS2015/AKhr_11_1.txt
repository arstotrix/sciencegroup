The graph demostrates the difference between men and women in post-school qualifications in 1999 in Australia. At first, it's evident that more than 80% of men had a skilled vocational diploma whereas only 10% of women had such one. It demonstrates the willingness of men to continue education. But the distribution between the sexes in Bachelor's degree shows the almost equal amount of those who have this degree. On the contrary, there is a significant divergence in post graduates and Master's degree between males and females. More than 50% of men have these academic diplomas as well while the precentage of women who have the same degree is lower than 40%. It means that in general men tend to continue their education untill they reach the highest academic degree and that they might be more educated as well. To sum it up, there's a tremendous disruption between men and women in educational sphere. The histogram shows clear prevalation of men in this field which means that they are probably have better qualification than women.
