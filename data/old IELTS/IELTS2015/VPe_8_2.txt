Our world develop quite dynamic and new types of lifestyle have become more popular. A gap year after school has been getting a lot of media resources coverage nowadays because of it's popularity. To look at the matter at both sides, i try to illustrate benefits and detriments of this.
First of all, some people finished a school are not mature enough to resolve a problem of further education. Making a right choice might be quite complicated for them who has not realised yet own preferences. A good illustration for this my sister's experience choosen wrong sphere for education and ended it after a small period. Moreover, during a year after school individual can travel, for instance, or try to do something new. This is likely to be very efficient in areas like geography, or broadcasting horizonts since when you travel you know lots of details about locations, customs and traditions. This knowledge might probably be a significant background for development.
On the other hand , some people believe that this activity likely to be a waste of time . When a person finishes school and starts independent life very often she or he has not enough money to live. For this reason they start to waste parent’s money. Furthemore, during a year they lose a desire to continue education and to be hired in a good job in future. That is why for many people a gap year seems to be a time – consuming activity. 
In conclusion I would like to say that every opinion has it’s prons and cons and might existe.
