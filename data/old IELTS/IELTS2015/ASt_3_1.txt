The given diagram represents how was changing the percent of the population aged over 65 years in the period from 1940 to 2040 in Japan, Sweden, and USA.
	As we can see from this picture, in 1940 this proportion was the greatest in USA and equaled nearly 9%. But after that in 4 decades it grew sustainably. Then up to the end of the country this percent fell and then up to the 2020`s it remained stable. After that it began to rise up to 2040, when it hitted the peak and equaled nearly 23%. Nearly the same picture we can see about Sweden, with some not meaning differences. From 1990 to 2010  the proportion of population aged 65 and over  in Sweden increased rapidly, then up to 2030 it decreased  slowly and then as in USA rocketed up to 2040, where it heat the peak of nearly 25%. Original line we can see in Japan.  From 1940 to 1960 it fell down and heated the low of nearly 3%, then up to 1990 it kept constant, then up to 2030 it raised up to 10% and then it rocketed to it`s maximum of nearly 27% in 2040. 
	To sum up, I would line to emphasise, that overall percent of «old» population in these three countries increased nearly in 5 times.
