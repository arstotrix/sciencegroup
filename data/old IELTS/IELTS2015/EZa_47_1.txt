The chart in this task swows which diplomas  males and females have in Australia. 
It is seen that the number of a men who graduated from university and bachelor's degree is less than women. However, comparising that numbers in percentage it is seen that 45% versus 55% is not a big differences. Moreover, person oportion of men who graduated from postgraduate places and have master's degree is more higher than proportiokn of women. Amount of a female in this two categories is too farfrom males part. And the gap between them is uo to 40%.
The same situation is with that group who have skilled vocational diploma. Females are not interestred in this sphere, that is why the number of males rather big up to 90% of all gender. 
Only undergraduate diplomas sections shows us that part ofwemen is twice more than part of men in Australia in 1999.
