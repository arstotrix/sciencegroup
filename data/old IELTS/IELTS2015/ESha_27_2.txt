Nowadays, there are many creative artists around the world. All of that they do should not restricted by the government.


The opinion that the creative artists should have a right to express their emotions and ideas has some evidence. For example, if artists lie, people will protest against the government, which let such activities. Now, in the world there is a democration and all cuntries should let people to be fee and do what they want. If one country restrict creative artists to do something, it will have some problems because rest of the countries will against of this.


On the other hand, such activities as paintings and pictures, writing articles or books should be do according to the laws of the country, because they can destroy the ideas of other people. In addition, bad things should not be showed to children or religion people, for example recently groups of women has sung the song against the government in the church and has destoyed the ideas of religion people, who have been there.


In conclusion, I agree with that creative artists should have the freedom to express their own points of view.
