The bar charts below provide informantion about how age influence on students reasons for studying and how much support do they get from their employers.
Firstly it could be considered that students from the age group of under 26 mainly drcide to study in order to build a successful career. Also they get alot of attention from their managers: somewhere around 60%. Compared to them 70% of people over 49 years of age learn only for their interest. In addition stuudents  from this group of age get sightly more then 40 percent of the employers support. Besides that only 20 percents of people between 30 and 39 years old are willing to study for interest. By contrast aproximetly 55 percent of students from the same age group beleive that learning could be extremely helpful in terms of building a career. Aslo the chart illustrates that people from both age groups 30-39 years old and 40-49 years old are getting equal attention from their chiefs.
To sum up it could be sad that amount of student learning for interest rises with the age. In addition the graph illustrates that there is a tendency of a decrease in the amount of employers attention which is occured by the age aswell.
