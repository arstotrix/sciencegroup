   Public health is a one of the most crusial part in the creation of the society`s well-being. There are a lot of ways to reach this aim. Sometimes the best way for this is saying to build a large number of sport facilities. I tend to think that this wouldn`t have a lot of influence. I also firmly believe that society should provide another measures for this.
   The main arguments against the statement that increasing sports buildings and facilities improve public health is personal interests. If person does not like sports, it is highly unlikely that he would change his opinion and would joint to sports. Furthermore, the most of people are usually very busy and they really have not time to go into sports due to their work or study.
   Secondly, all people have different abilities and this fact should not be forgotten. People, who have not certain opportunites, may fell embarassing themselves. Especially, it concerns disable people, because they gave significant difficulties in sports. To improve public health in this case, it its necessary to creaty a special conditionals for such group of people.
   Despite the arguments mentioned before, it is certainly true that sometimes sports facilities have a good impact on public health. However, necessary requirements should provide. For instance, groups with similar abilities should create. Moreover, people should know about vary opportunites on sport sphere, therefore information about sports facilities must be spread widely. Under these condicition, effect on public health will increase. At the same time, people should be taught to balanced diet, healthy food, etc.
   To conclude, the large number of sports facilities is not the best way to improve population`s health. because of the several disadvantages. However, if necessary conditionals will be create it is probably to influence on the public health and sports will be for soul.
