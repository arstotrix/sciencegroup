Task 2.
   Nowaday a lot of people concern about public health and they believe that the expansion of available sports facilities is necessary. However, others are not so optimistic about this way of improving human health and suggest to look for another decision.
   From my point of view, we need to find a compromise. It is a wellknown fact that the variety of sports territories like football fields, basketball grounds encourage people to do sports and it improves their health, while they are doing different exercises. I believe that increasing the number of sport schools and centers will provide people of all ages with the desire to attend them. Of course, the government should carefully think about an approupriate staff for such kind of work as only professionals can create good conditions in order to improve health of elder people or make the body of young people stronger.
   Nevertheless, some people argue that all these efforts are not enough as a large number of people just do not want to follow a healthy lifestyle, they feel themselves comfortable in their bodies. Truly, the government policy of creating more and more sorts facilities will not work while we will not find other incentives for them. For example, we can study special free programmes for them in order to show that doing exercises will help them to stay healthy. Moreover, it is a good idea to reduce the time in front of our conymters and phones as it can cause a huge number of deseases.
   To put in a nutshell, I strongly believe that we should take care of our health and do not forget that our body is our future life. Governmentâ€™s aim is to encourage people to do sports and its politics can combine different methods for doing this.
