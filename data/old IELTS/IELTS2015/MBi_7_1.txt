The data given illustrate the percentage of people older than 64 amoung the whole population in three countries, Japan, Sweden and USA, during the period from 1940 to 2040.
It can be deduced from the graph that the biggest proportion of aged people by the end of the given period was in Japan where the amount of people aged 65 and over dramatically increased from 2030 to 2040 by more than 15 percents, resulting in 27 percents in 2040. Similarly, the number of people over 64 greatly increased in Sweden from about 7 percents in 1940 to morethan 25 percents in 2040. USA demonstrates a steady growth of aged population in the period under discussion, raising from approximately 9 percents in 1940 to less than 25 percents in 2040.
Overall, it can be said that the proportion of people of 65 and older demonstrates an upward trend in all three countries. Japan showed the greatest increase in percentage of aged people among its population, while in USA this proportion grew up insignificantly.
