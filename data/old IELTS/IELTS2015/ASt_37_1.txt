The table provides information about subway-systems in different cities all over the world.
To begin with, all data in the table structurized by the age of underground railway system. As the table shows, the oldest subway system is situated in London and the newest is located in Los - Angeles. The next point of the table is total length of route in kilometers. The biggest one is London subway (about 394 km) and the smallest one is situated in Koyoto (about only 11 km) so, Kyoto is an example which breaks coherence between age and total length. But in general, all underground railway system which were opened earlier than 1989 had more the 100 km of total length of route. The third point of the table is passengers per year measured in millions of people. The most overcrowded subway system is located in Tokyo which is visited by 1927 millions people per year. The less overcrowded underground underground railway system is Kyoto subway which is also the smallest one. It was visited only by 11 million people per year.
Overall, the table shows the coheneinces between the age and the length of route between the length of route and number of visitors per year.
