The modern era has changed our pace of life in numerous ways and one of the negative outcomes is the reduction of physical activity, resulting in the health issues for a lot of people. Some say that the best solution is to increase the number of sport facilities, while others see such measure as ineffective, so what would be the best option? In my opinion, to increase people’s physical activity, it has to become a part of everyday routine. First of all, governments can improve both quality and quantity of bycicle facilities for their citizens. Such measures will not only benefit in the public health, but also in ecologic means. Another solution would be the introduction of sport-breaks during the time, when people are at their workplaces. Community excercises, such as flexes, bendings and aerobics can both improve the overall worker’s performance and the emotional unity of the crew. The introduction of new sport facilities is another solution, most people support. Such measures provide cities with greater infrastructure and may attract some people to doing sports. The problem here is that this solution does not stimulate people to be active, but only gives them an opportunity they can easily refuse. To improve public health, we have to make sports a basis for our everyday lives, but not an optional choice. Finally, I would like to underline the main point of my essay: to improve public health, sports and physical activity should become a necessary part of everyone’s life, while sport clubs offer only and optional choice, which could be avoided.
