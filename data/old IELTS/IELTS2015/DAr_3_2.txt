Nowadays there exists a great amount of opportunities to increase healthcare level in the country. Numbers of people say that it is possible to improve health level opening new sport facilities, while others are against it, arguing that it is ineffecient way for people. Who is right? To begin with, increasing of the number of sport facilities will solve the problem of scarcity of places for people disiring to be healthy. What is more, by building sport grounds in schools and universities the government can enlarge the number of children involved in physical activities, that can directly effect on children health in the nearest future. On the contrary, this solution can have little impact on people health as a great amount of people does not involved not only in sports, but even simple physical activities. A wide range of sports centeres cannot directly impact on peoples' mind, so it is natural, that there should be used some other measures, for instance, it can be the sports propagande of the government. From my point of view, there should be some measures which can work all together. Firstly, increase of fitness-centers, secondly, sport popularisation in the country and, thirdly, the increase of level of people involvement in physical activities. To sum up, the idea of building of new sport centers can works only in case when government use other helping measures.
