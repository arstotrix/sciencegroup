Nowadays, some people argue in favor of accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject be Universities.
Personally, I totally disagree with this point of view. Despite the fact I am always allow many theories and opinions about any questions, it is exception, because I do not reason for accepting such a system. Conversely, there are some arguments which contadict it.
First of all, it is scientifically proved that there are obvious differences between brains of human being. Some part of humanity is more succesful in analysis and counting, other part is more talented in arts and communication. And the proportions depends on gender too. So, if system will be applied, more talented people can lose their places in universities.
The second reason is that actual system is working: males are more efficient and succesful in their own spheres of economy and females in theirs. To my mind, nothing can prevent or stop extinction of stereotype of  dependance of gender on people lives. As for me, it is irrational to change something if it works correctly.
The third argument in favor of my opinion is about devastating effect on economic system. Employers would still try to find qualified and talented managers among males and skillful cooks among females. So there will be the deficite of working places.
To sum up, it is worth noticing that this question is not quite interesting or controversial for me.  Moreover, it is evident for me that such kind of system will not be applied anywhere, because government values the economy of the country much higher than tolerance and gender equality.
