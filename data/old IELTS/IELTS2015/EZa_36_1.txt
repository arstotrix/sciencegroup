The graph illustrates the amount of using electricity in winter and summer time in on average English home.
On the graph we can see that the typical daily demand for electricity in winter time is higher than in the summer time, ecpecially between 13 and 23 hours. It reaches its peak in the evening, at about 22 o'clock. People of England use less units of electricity in the mornings, between 6 and 9 hours. Perhaps this is caused by need in heating rooms and water and the fact that winter days are shorter. In summer we can see the other situation. People use electricity almost twice less. In this case the maximum use of units of electricity is 20000, while in winter it is more than 40000.
All in all, the situation is clear: it is an usual thing that in cold winter days we need much more warm and light, in summer the sun gives us all these things and we do not need to replace sun light by electricity.
