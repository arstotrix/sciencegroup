It is absolutely true, that during the 20 years near 52 million visits abroad by UK residents. That is rather big procent for UK. And just only about 27 million visits o the UK by overseas residents.

In details we see that the most popular countries visited by UK residents are: France, Spain and the USA. But this information for 1999 years period.

In particular if we try to compare 2 lines (the first: visits abroad by UK residents, the second: visits to the UK by overseas residents) we see that the main difference between them was from period the 1985 to 1989. In this period of time the percent of visits abroad by the UK is higher than the percent of visits to the UK.

As I understand the most attractive country for visit among the british people is France. As we see it on one of the charts in 1999 France have visited about 11 millions of UK visitors.
