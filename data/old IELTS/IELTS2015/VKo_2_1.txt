The given bar-chart presents data about how the levels of post-school qualification differed and varied among men and women.
As it can be seen from the chart more than 90 per cent of men got the skilled vocational diploma, which is the largest amount by far. The number of women who have got the highest post school qualification is almost nine time as small as the number of men. So, the most significant difference is obvious. However, women lead in getting the undergraduate diploma. Another dramatic difference can be observed while examining the amount of men and women who got the post graduate diploma. 70% of male graduates got the postgraduate diploma, the same as the undergraduate diplomas among women, and the second noticable figure for this bar chart. Only 35% of men have the bachelor's degree, which is 10% less than the number of women with this qualification.
Observing the presented data, it should be noticed that in 1999 women made less succes comparing with female students. It is almost overall trend, except the undergraduate diploma and the bachelor's degree, that number of men prevails over women figures.
