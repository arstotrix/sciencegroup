Task 2.
   Nowadays, argues about the necessary of increasing the number of sports facilities is urgent. Some people think, that there won’t be an effect. Others think that it will help to improve public health. The question is, whether it is useful to increase the number of sports facilities or not?
On the other hand, sport is life. From my point of view, increasing the number of sports facilities will be useful. Firstly, for kids and teenagers. Nowadays the problem of my and next generation is that teens waste their time in front of their computers, tablets e.t.c. If they won’t change their way of life, by the age 25 they will be just coach potatoes with the bouquet of diseases. Any sports facilities, especially free, will make them be able to keep fit and become healthier and stronger.
   On the other hand, simple increasing of sportgrounds and other facilities is not the way out. For example, all new gyms are too expensive for the majority of citizens and only a few of them are able to visit them. Moreover, it’s not very easy to built a simple sportsground, because, it is more profitable for civil cervants to built a mall or shop, than free sportsground for children. Finally, people just don’t have enough time to do sports because of work or studying.
   Finally, I’d like to say that it’s only each humans choice – to be healthy or not. So, even if a human works 5 days a week and don’t have much money, he can just have a run every evening. Anyway, if a person wants to keep fit, he will do it.
