Nowadays, many schools araund the world has some several problems with their student’s behaviour. But why this problems are severe?

I believe, that in European countries many young people have several problems and interests. It may be sport or girls/boys, party and over interests, but not school. The youth don’t want be professors, they want be soul of the friend’s company. They want dancing, singing, plaing in the computer games and something else. But they must go to school, do their homework, read some boring books. It is not interesting for teenagers. Of course, some people want go to school and become more and more clever, but the number of this puples are very small. When you about 13-17 years, you want go to the caffee with your boyfriend or girlfriend, you want fall in love. I think, that it is a main causes for their behaviour. Moreover, in some cases children want to take a lot of attention, and they can do some bad things.

I supposed, that the teachers can do something for solution this problem. For example, they can show some videos and pictures during the lesson. I think, if they do this, the puple’s interest are roket. Maybe, in the schools should make more clubs for children, who want plaing football, sing or dance. Children can do something, that they want and maybe they start learning their homework, because if they get bad mark, they can not go into a club.

I believe, that if you young and healf, you can do many things, and get a good marks. But, in my point of view, if theachers helps puples in this case, they can do much more.
