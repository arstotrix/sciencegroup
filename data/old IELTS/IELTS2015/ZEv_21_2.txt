Nowadays most of schools face with the problems caused by student behaviour. There are several explanation of that situation; I think, the main reason of issues with bad behaviour at school is the lack of parents’ role in education, which is dismissed by influence of mass media.

In modern world both  of parents are so busy by work and stressful lufestyle that they don’t have time to communicate enough with their child. School which originally plays role of second agient of socialization, tend to be the only one institute to teach student how to behave. But all students can not take the same attantion at school and if causes lack of manners which is necessory for the right behaviour. If parents spend more time with their children, this problems won’t be so huge.

There is another source transating the different types of behaviour for students – the mass culture. Watching TV shows, series or cruel films with fights, violence, students become to think that it is a typical behaviour. When this child face the same situation in real life, he will probably act according to the behaviour’s model from movie. It means that society should carefully watch out standarts of films and TV shows which students are allowed to watch. For example, in Russia all films devided by several categories according to age of audience; students (under 18) must not watch movies with cruel scence.

To conclude, my point is that the best way to solve problems with students’ behaviour is increasing a role of family in children’s education and socialization. Children should see the models of behaviour not from the TV screen but from parents.
