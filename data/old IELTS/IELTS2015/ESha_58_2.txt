Nowadays, the problem of public health is widely discussed : while some people believe that it is important to provide population with more sport facilities, others tend to think that this measure is not really effective.


On the one hand, more fitness clubs, sport gyms and other sport facilities allow more people attending them. For example, if there is only one swimming pool in the big city, not everyone can visit it because the number of avalibable places is limited. At the same time, if there are ten fitness clubs, people have more opportunities to attend them and keep fit. Moreover, competitive organizations usually have lower prices which makes possible to attract more people.


On the other hand, great number of sport facilities do not insure that they will be popular with people. In this way it is essential to teach both children and adults to be more careful about their health. For instance, some special classes can be held in school and universities. They can help students to refuse negative habits and to learn what to do to be a healthy person. Besides, mass media can change people's attitude to their health promoting sport and food reach with vitamins.


Personally, I think that only a family can make a really huge contribution to improving national health. A person, who knows from the birth, why it is important to lead active lifestyle, eat various food and avoid junk food, can always find an opportunity to do sport, even if there are not enough sport facilities.


All in all, I tend to think that a government should not only build and organize more sport centres but also teach people how to be healthy.
