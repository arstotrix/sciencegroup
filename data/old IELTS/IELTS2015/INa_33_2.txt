Task 2.
   Nowadays, one of the urgent problems seems to be public health, as many people die young because of the health problems. Some believe that more sport facilities should be provided, others argue that it is not efficient. However, I suppose that the sports facilities are really good, but we need to use additional measures on national level to defend public health.
   One the one hand, increasing the number of sport facilities solves many problems connected with pullic health. The math is the teens’ health, who are especially fragile encourage teenagers to do sports instead of sitting behind the TV, consequently, the level of health in society starts to increase as teens use their opportunity to be engaged in sports in their local courts or pools. Moreover, sport facilities can help parents to spend healthy time with their children.
   One the other hand, sport can be harmful for some people, and sport isn’t effective for eldery people. The main concern is the healthy environment and products. Other measures than providing sport facilities, seem to be more effective. As we build more parks, grow healthy food and prohibit harmful products, as we invest money in hospitals and vaccine programs, we cover a wider range of social groups. For example, providing pure drinking water helps to decrease the number of diseases. Furthermore, health programs such as vaccination saves many lives. All of these measures improve public health.
   Thus, the lest way to solve the problem of public health is to continue introducing the sport facilities and using other measures such as vaccination or health programs and interesting in hospitals. As the different spheres of social life work sycnonized for reaching one arm, we can improve public health.
