   There are a lot of discussions about improving societyâ€™s health. In this case, some people means that increasing the number of sport facilities will make people to do sport more frequent, and will make public health better.
   The opposite point of view says, that such decision is uneffective, and more are a lot of much more productive measures are required nowadays. Both of this sides has pluses and minuses to discuss.
   First of all, it is important for people to take care about themselves. Our body is our guarantes of healthy life, so sport is the best decision in this case. And if number of sport facilities jumps, and people start to earn much more opportunities to do sports, than now and to take care about themselves, it logically will make their health better.
   On the other hand, there are a lot of different groups of people living on the Earth. Some of them, for example, are not interested in sport, and they would not change their mind in any case. People, who prefer healthy lifestyle and regular trainings will find an opportunity to do sports in any case. So, such measure is uneffective because it do not have an influence on some groups of people.
   To my mind, both points of view are right. But the best decision in this case is a complex method, which will sum both of this. It is important to increase the number of sports facilities; but we must not forget about the other things, which influence our health-ecological environment, economic situation, e.t.c.
   To sum up, there are a lot of different projects about making our health better. And there are a lot of discussion around it. Finding the best way to take care of our body and mind is the most important goal for society nowadays.
