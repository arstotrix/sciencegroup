There are many points of view on the question if universities should limited the number of each sex in every subject or not. Some people are strongly believe that this idea is a really good, while other can’t agree with them. On my mind, this way of thinking is a really harmful for the human rights.
First of all, we should understand, that university is the last stage of the preparation for the real life. Therefore it is one of the most important stage of the socialization of students. If the high schools will show them the destroying of the male or female rights, students will use this practice in their future life. This situation will provide the other system of the relationships between sexes and the destroying of the human rights.
Secondly, the main question of this separation will be the reasons for accepting equal numbers. Unfortunatly it is really unrealable to make an objective rules for each sex without destroying another one. For example, sometimes women can’t get some jobs because of the strange rules about the age and family of the candidate. In my opinion, the same situation will be with the Universities.
For example, many years ago in Russian there were a schools for girls and schools for boys. There were no relationships between them and the whole system of relationships was another. So we can’t say that we know what the world will be after the new rules.
To sum up, the main reason why the idea of limiting number of each sex is really awful is the destroying of human rights. On my mind, the main tendency in the world is to giving more and more freedom to male and female and it is one the main agenda in the international relationships. That’s why we should oat attention on the idea of separating or limiting the fights of the each sex and trying to prevent the destroying of rights.
