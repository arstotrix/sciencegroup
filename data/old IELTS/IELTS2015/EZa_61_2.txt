Nowadays creativity is an item which is often discussed in today's world.  Some people consider that creative people should have freedom in expressing their views and ideas. Another claim is that the government should control the works of artists. 
Certainly, this issue is worth discussion and there can not be one opinion. On the one hand, every musician or peot wants to show his or her thoughts, views. These creative people have many ideas which should be expressed and it wil be unfair if officials restrict their freedom. Humanity has the beautiful works of art, dramatics and musical compositions thanks to talented artists who had no limitations. 
On the other hand, not all creative people have the ideas which can be appreciated in our society. Their creations probably can be shocking, indecent and cruel. Or, as it can be shown in many cases, person thinks that he or she is talented andhis or her ideas are worth to be expressed, but in fact this creation has no value for humanity and society and these ideas can be even dangerous if they areconnected with the themes of racism, war and death. In situation like that, the restrictions from government can be important step to prevent negative effects or such "work of art". These restrictions can be taken in film pproduction, media and books. 
Taking everything in account, it should be said that the freedom is a necessary part of work of every creative person, but the government should pay attention on such creations,which can be dangerous and bad to the problems in society or harm some people.
