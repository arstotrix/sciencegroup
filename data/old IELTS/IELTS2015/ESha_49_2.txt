As it is commonly understood to day the level of public health plays a significant role in the developing of society. One of the most appropriate way of improving public health is to provide people with more sport facilities. However, some people believe that such kind of method is not effective and that other solutions to the problem should be found. Personally, I am sure that increasing the number of sports facilities, in fact, can improve public health.


First of all, there is a clear connection between the quantity of sports facilities and public health. It is quite obvious that if there are more sports facilities there will be more opportunities to improve health. What is more, we should take into consideration the fact that people are influenced by the advertisement and that is why it is not so complicated to make people want to use sports facilities more often. Last but not the least is the point that  the big number of sports facilities will undoubtly lead to the improvement of the level of service, equipment and staff. Moreover, such situation is positive because of the fact that sports facilities will be more reliable and convinient.


But others reckon that he increasing the number of sports facilities will not lead to the appropriate result. First of all, healthy way of living is not so significant in society nowadays. Furthermore, it is quite complicated to provide society with sports facilities. Finally, there are other factors that influence public health and of course methods of improving are different.


In conclusion, I would like to reckon that while the problems concerning public health are existing different methods of its solving will appear. As any other method the increasing the number of sport facilities has its advantages and drawbacks. But as for me, I guess that such kind of method is quite effective.
