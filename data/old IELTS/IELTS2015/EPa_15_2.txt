The public health is very important questions, which governments must to regulate. Today all people have some serious problems withe their health, for example, injures people, or toll people, who have a lot of problem in their life, and also there are people, who need a health life. Some experts believe that the sport activity may help them to make a solution with health. They have some serious arguments for their own opinion. The sport may help to be solve. Sportsmens are quite health people and some people think that it is so easy. The sport need a lot of phisical excersices and some sportsmens can get injures only for training. But people can not think about it, they think that it is very easy and so comfortable. Another people think that increasing the number of sport facilities can have only little effect formaking population more healthier. I agree with this opinion because not every people who started to do sport can do it clearly or can do it at all time. People need the instructors for all kind of their activity, but it can not means that they can be more healthier. The scientists hope that the government can make a desision with the unhealthy people by some methods, for example to increase the number of sport center or do it more comfortable. And also, they can stop to buy some dangerous things in country and closed some manufactury, which do it. 
But it isn`t so really now because the governments spend a lot of money, but people can not be health.
