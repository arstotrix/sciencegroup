It goes without saying that in some countries taking a gap year is a very usual event.
Obviously, young people are eager to get some experience which might come in handy in the future. Moreover, it may protect them from choosing the occupation which is not suitable for them. But on the other hand, it has some side effects. Let us compare its advantages and disadvantages.
Some people say that travelling is a golden opportunity to broaden the outlook. It is needless to say that a great amount of people are mad about it. Predictably, the graduates who are tired of studying consider going to unknown places to be a good rest. In fact students are often exhausted after taking their final exams. So they deserve to have some fun. Moreover, they are to meet new people whose ideas and opinions might change the graduatesâ€™ attitude to life and education. As a result, they become more mature and they will make less mistakes or even avoid decisions which are likely to be wrong.
At the same time, I must admit there are some disadvantages. Firstly, people lose their time and money instead of studying. Furthermore, they can get used to idle life so it will be no easy task to continue education. It will be incredibly difficult for them to concentrate on hard work.
To cut a long story short, I believe that its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. What I am driving at is that students had better not miss the opportunity to study. If I finished school this year, I would not interrupt my education.
