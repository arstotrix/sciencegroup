Task 1.
   The pie charts reveal the information about the age of the populations of Italy and Yemen in both 2000 and 2050. The diagrams include three parts.
   As an overall trend, in both countries there is an age of population that remains fairly steady from 2000 to 2050. In Yemen it is the age of 60 and over. In Italy it is the age of 0-14 years.
   A more detailed look shows that the population at the age of 15-59 years will rise sharply in Yemen (to 57, 3%). In contrast, there will be a significant decrease from 61, 6% to 46, 2% in this age in Italy. We can also see that the percentage of the population at the age of 0-14 years will decline form 50, 1 to 37, 0 in Yemen.
   To sum up, the information given from the charts, there will be the main trand in both countries in 2050: approximately 50% of populations will be at the age of 15-59 years.
