Writing task 1.
   The charts below show the data on Yemen’s and Italy’s citizens population and its possible future development. All charts include three groups of people, which are: children, middle-aged and elderly people.
   At a first sight the charts differ a lot. However, the charts representing year 2000 have much in common. Both countries have a wide majority of adults which is    40 % in Yemen and about 15 % more in Italy. However children in Yemen are the biggest group and their number estimates 50 %, whereas population of Italy has only 15 % children.
   The second chart of Yemen’s population looks much alike the first chart of Italy. The only difference is a still big number of children which estimates about 40 %. In 2050 Italy, as many other European countries, is likely to have the same number of elderly people and adults, about 45 % both and dramatically small amount of children.
