Some people suggest that creative people need for freedom of choices and freedom of speech. And the geverment should not prohbit artists to create something new.
	First of all I think there is a problem between wishes of artists and church ideology. For example we could see the Pussy Riot action is no doubt that there perfomanse is an act of devil. It doesnot matter what they wanted to say but whole religios people ignore is strictly restricted. I would like to give example from the book “Master and Margarita”, written by Bulgakov. Russian government has introduced the cencorship and it was not allowed to speak bad about their country. That is why the book was published only after Bulgakov’s death and many people did not have a opportunity to speak with author and some people did not have a time to read it and enjoy it. On the other hand it is really good when creative artists have the freedom to express theire own ideas becaus this is the way to create something new. If artist have not this oppotunity  to create what they want what is the reason to make something? It is clear that art play very important role in our lifes and we need it.
	Overall, I think that it is better to have the freedom to express somethink and say to world your own ideas but creative artists need to understand what is good and what is bad.
