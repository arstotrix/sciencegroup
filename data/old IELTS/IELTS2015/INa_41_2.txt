Writing task 2.
   Nowadays, it is fashionable to take care about health and many people are more concern about their health than in the past. Everyday knows that the best way to stay healthier is doing sport exercises, eat healthy, natural food and not to drink alcohol. Governments in many countries think that they can improve public health only by building new sport facilities in the area. There are many people who find these actions use less but I personally disagree with them, because I’m sure that these measures can have huge effect on public health.
   First of all, sport facilities are vital for less motivate and lousier people. These category of people can give up exersing easily, they just need to find a reason. They are so lazy or don’t have enough time to do sport far from home even if it their fitness club in neighbor area. By increasing the number of sport facilities in the area such people might not give in their health so easily.
   On the other hand, some people believe that increasing facilities is only one way of improving public health and moreover, it is not the best. For example, these people suggest to support a healthy food, which makes people stronger and predicts many serious diseases. In contrast, too fat food can be a reason of obesity, heart attacks. In addition, the bad ecology in big cities can damage our health seriously and in this case nor healthy food neither sport exercises can help to save our health.
   In conclusion, it should be said that increasing the number f sport facilities is one of the good method to develop public health, but in my opinion, this measure is nt enough. Not only does state support positive ways, but state should also get rid of the negative point. Moreover, each person should take care about his health himself too, because it is private business.
