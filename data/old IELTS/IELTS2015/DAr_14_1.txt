These pie charts provide a summary of age structure of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and predictions about this structure in 2050. It is clear that a percentage of 0-14 y.o. and 15-59 y.o. in Yemen 2000 is almost equal. The chart also shows that a piece of 60+ y.o. is very small.

According to the predictions, a percentage of 60+ y.o. people will surge to almost a half of total population, meanwhile a percentage of 14 y.o. will gently fall. There is also a solid decrease in quantity of 15-59 y.o. people down to 46%. The overall trauds about these countries are different. While Yemenâ€™s 15-59 y.o. category is going to broaden, Italian is predicted to plunge.
