TASK 1
The information illustrated on the pictures is about comparison of age categories in population of two countries: Yemen and Italy in 2000 and 2050 years.
As we can see the bigger part of population in Yemen in 2000 year consisted from 0-14 years and 15-59 years old people, while there was only 3,6% of eldest generation.
The prediction is that by 2050 year the number of middle generation (15-59 years old group) will increase.
In Italy is a little bit different situation. In 2000 year the eldest generation occured approximately a quarter of all population and only 14,3% consisted from the youngest generation. And by 2050 percent of more than 60 years old people will continue to rise and will be 42,3%.
All in all, we can say that in Yemen population will be younger and in Italy it is an opposite effect, because population become older.
