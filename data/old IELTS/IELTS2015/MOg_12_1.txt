The table presents information about the underground transport systems in six different cities. The table includes information about the date of opening, length in kilometres and a number of pasangers per year in every underground railway system in each of the six cities.
The oldest and the biggest underground railway system is in London, which was built in 1863 and it’s route is 394 kilometres long. Despite the fact that Tokyo’s underground railway system is younger and smaller than London’s one, it is the most crowded metro system: 1927 millions passangers per year. The youngest railway system is in Losangeles and the smallest and least crowded is in Kyoto, there route is only 11 kilometres long. Compared with other cities’ underground railway systems, Washington DC’s one stays in the middle: it’s route is much bigger than Kyoto’s and Los Angele’s systems and a number of passangers per year is much less than in London and Paris.
