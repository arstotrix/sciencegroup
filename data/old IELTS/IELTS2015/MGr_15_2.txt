The question of happiness is one of the most difficult questions, people have always been concerned with. The mankind eagered to create a universal formula of happiness, but I find it completely impossible. Why happiness can’t be the same one for everyont and how people can achieve it?
In my opinion, this issue doesn’t have a strict deffinition because for everyone it has its own particular meaning. The happiness is a state of an absolute inner harmony and everyone should find what matters him feel peaceful and provide him positive emotions. Moreover, the state of happiness might be based on the person’s inner believes, social area he was brought up in, his financial states. For instance, if a child was brought in severe conditions and was lack of money, food and clother, his happiness will come with the ability to eat well abd wear appropriate clothes. What’s for factors which are important to achieve happiness, I can name your ability to feel yourself and be awared of your true inner needs. In addition, the person should help other people find their own way of happiness in order to find his one.
To conclude, happiness is a conceptual issue and everyone should find his sollution to this problem himself.
