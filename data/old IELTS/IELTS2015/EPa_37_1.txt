The charts show changes in percentage for 3 age groups in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and predictions for 2050. 
Speaking about Yemen it is significant to stress the domination of young people which was 50,1% in the beginning of XXI century. In Italy group of this age (0-14 years) took almost only a 1/7 of a chart, and the main position was given to middle-aged group which was four times larger than young-aged one. In Yemen people of 15-59 years were numerous, almost like youngsters, but less for 4 per cents. So, the rest 3,6% were residents older than 60 years. Taking into concideration Italy`s numbers, older population was a quater of the whole.
Comparing 2000 year with 2050 the tendency is clear – the percentage of middle-aged people will grow for approximately 10% reducing youngsters for 13% in Yemen. The same changes are predicted in Italy for 15-59 year-old and 60+ year-old people – these groups are going to level-off in percentage.
All things considered, and the main features show, that in Yemen middle-aged group is going to take more percentage, while in Italy this group is going to be reduced by doubled number of old people.
