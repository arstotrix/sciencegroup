Today is becoming more popular to have unusual profession such as: artists, actors and e.g. A lot of this specialities are provided by freedom.
Initialy consider why government should not monitor for artist. On the one hand it is great idea, because they can sence themselve more freedom and creat some musics, wright books or do pictures. If the government does not say that artist must do it leads in good ships. And they can do what they want.
On the other hand it is very dangerous for society, because some part of population do not agree with this statement, as people want freedom in each sphere of their life or work. And if artists are not observed and do all of they wish, thas start to begin a chaos in country. 
I partly agree with this statement, because office workers should attend their work in time and do that their employees say. Moreover it is discipline, when they are dressed in uniform. But this situation is not suitable for creating person. As they can not wear some ordinairy dress, artists usualy have a good sence of styly and we do not understand their mind. They are needed for freedom atmosphere and appropriate surrounding for  creating new unbelievable things. Unfortunately government shoul provide some actions for monitoring their activity, because sometime poets can write antigovernmental books or states, which can worth influence for population.
In conclusion it should be pointed that creative persons are needed by freedom, but government should partly monitor of its actions and activities.
