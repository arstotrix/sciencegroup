The graph line provides information on the number of people in millions who lived in the UK and traveled abroad and the number of people who visited the UK over the period between 1979 and 1999. The diagram shows the countries which had been visited by UK natives by 1999.

All in all, the number of people who visited the UK in 1979 was slightly different from the number of people who went abroad in the same year, while in the end of the period there is a large difference in them. France and Spain were the leaders among the countries which had been the most popular among UK residents by 1999. In the beginning of the period, there are 10 millions of people who stayed in the UK from other countries. This number is approximately as big as the number of people who left the country. The numbers for the both figures grew slowly till 1985.

After 1985 there was a (?) increase in the number of the residents who visited after countries, the figure peaks at 52 millions in 1999. On the contrary, the line for the overseas residents  grew (stadibly?) during the period from 1990 to 1999, peaking at 27 millions of the residents in 1999. However, the increase for the number of visits to the UK by the overseas residents was not as significant as for the number of visits abroad by UK residents. 

The diagram shows that the most popular country for UK natives was France, followed by Spain and other ones including Turkey, Greece and the USA. The number of people, who had visited France by 1999 is 11 millions, which is slightly different from the number of people, who visits Spain, which is under 10 millions of people. The figures for the other countries are approximately equal and small.
