The charts provide us with the information about visits abroad by the UK residents and visits into the UK by foreigners.

As  we can see from the first chart, the amount of travellings to and from the UK in 1979 were approximately the same (about 10-12 millions). These figures raised rapidly by 1984, and the difference between two figures in 1999 was about 25-30 millions/52 millions trips from the UK and 27 millions visits to the UK).

The second chart shows us that the most popular country visited by UK residents in 1999 is France(11 millions of visitors from the UK). The less popular country is Turkey (about 2 millions of visitors).

All in all, the number of visits from the UK is rising quickly, while the amount of visits to the UK by overseas resident is rising slightly.
