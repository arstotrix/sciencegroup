Hapiness is considered very important in life. Why is it difficult to define? What factors 

are important in achivieving hapiness? For human-being hapines is one of the most important 

things in our life. But some people cannot explain what do they mean when they speak about 

hapiness because persons are so different and each of us has different definitions of the 

happiness. And  as a result we use different things for achivieng it, as they depend on our 

vision of happiness.
Everybody tries to find their own hapiness. First of all, I should say that if the person 

doesn't feel happy at all he or she doesnt see any sense of life. Secondly, I consider, 

that if you found your place in the world , you found your own happiness.
Different people consider as happiness different things. Thus, for some people hapiness is 

new gadget, for others is their family. Tastes is differ: people do various types of 

activity and find pleasure in different things. For one happiness is doing sport, for other 

reading favourite book: intrests may very. According to this we can see misunderstanding 

between people in question: "What is happiness?"
It's common knowledge, that happiness is love, health, family. As for me, if I feel lonely  

I cannot be happy as I find happiness in love and communication. Also, you cannot feel 

happiness if you are ill or have pain. Relationships in family support us in difficult 

situations.
In conclusion, I should say, that hope to achive happiness gives us sense of life. In 

addition, happiness can vary from person to person. Family, love and health are the main 

factors for achiving happiness.
