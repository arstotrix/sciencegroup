In the last two decades an awful tendency occurred: the number of crimes carried out by students have increased dramatically. Overall, in many countries we can see severe problems with teenagers` behaviour. What are the causes of this and what measures are to be taken? In this essay I will try to answer this question.

In my opinion the main reason for such a drastic change is that students seem not to be interested in their studies anymore. They are likely to spend more time hanging out outside than preparing for the assignment the teacher asked them to do. This results in the creation of street gangs that “shake the lives of local residents”. The solution for this issue is quite simple: to make the them show their own individuality through their school work.

Moreover, the hectic life of today may also be another cause of students` bad behaviour. We are being faced with stresses every day, trying to come up the career ladder and sometimes meet with other peoples` expectations. Bad behavior of some students might come from their unability to deal with the tension. And here is the school again that might be able to solve this issue. The school authorities might bring in additional classes with psychologists, that will look after the mental health of teenagers.

In conclusion, I would like to underline that in spite of the factors that force schoolars to behave unreasonably, if the suggested measures have been taken, the problem with the students` violance will be triggered.
