Nowadays, culture plays a huge role in our everyday life. There are many artists in modern society and we deal with their pictures, music and films very often. But where is the edge of their freedom? It is a disputable question.
On the other hand, in modern society all people can express the own opinion and, to my mind it is right. Moreover, art is a sphere, which differs from other spheres of life. It needs more freedom than others. Many artists express their opinion the way they understand by themselves and people, who are interested in art can sometimes be mistaken and do not understand what the artist means. It can causes problems. 
But on the other hand, if the governtment do not control the freedom of expressing ideas of artists, it will be very harmful for many people. For example, there are a lot of films, which influence badly on mind of young people. These films can have violent scenes. And often art can touch thems of religion, which is also can worry other people. 
All in all, the government should pay great attention to art, try to improve it and think about how to control it right way.
