The charts show information about the ages of the population for year 2000 and 2050 for two countries: Yemen and Italy. 
In 2000 about 50 per cent of the population in Yemen were people aged between 0 and 14 years. In 2050 the dominant age of the population is predicted to be one between 15 and 59 years. It also shown, that the 60+ years old will remain constant -  about 4-5 per cent.
There is a difference in statistics in Italy. Chart shows that in 2000 the bigest part of the populatio were 15-59 years old and other two groups shares about a third part. In 2050 there is a projected growth in population of age 60+. This part of the society will be doubled, there is practically no big change in 0-14 aged people, so that might mean, that life duration in Italy will be increased. 
To sum everything up might say that both countries are not facing the change in 0-14 aged group of people, but there are quiete big changes in other two groups of population.
