Nowadays, in modern society have an education become way to get well-paidjob. But teachers in huge numbers of coutries in process of education alsow have a problems with pupils behaviour. It’s extremely alarming question! Some people think that in by increased individual education tendency, another sugest that it cosed by family.

Who is right? Let’s discuss different options.

From the one hand, modern system of education adapt the pupils individuality. At the result of pocess of multicultural communication a lot of school class formed by pupils, whose pattern of behaviour not the same. Cultural difference of the counties, where this students was bonn not the same too. It becomes a reason of missunderstanding of classmates.

From another hand family play a big roll in the prosec of socialization of students. Usually, parents don’t pay attention on bad mood of their children. Students an scholl like a “reflection” their parents.

In my oppinion, the most sucesful way to solve this problem is parents control of they childrens lifes, may by they just want to be understended.
