Although it seems to be normal to let creative artists to express their own ideas without any limits, it can be bad to the functioning of the society. So, should the government create those limits of it will be better to give the freedom to artists. 
Firstly, although artists are generally considered exemplary individuals who aim at the progress of the humanity some could have vested interests in creating fricktions in the society. Art could be used as a tool to create such tensions among different groups of people, especially in a multicultural environment. For example, there have been many instances where film makers in India have included socially sensitive materials which coulkd hurt the religions or communal sentiments of certain groups. The censorship authority in India had been able to edit the contents of such movies to avoid social fricktions. This would mean that censorship is very essential in guiding creative artists to be socially responsible, while expressing their ideas. 
However, according to some censoring the freedom of artists could lead to suppression of basic human rights. They content that society has the maturnity to judge the positive and negative aspects of any work of art. Creative artists are instruments of such changes by exposing the society to various ideas. More over, corrupt and despotic rulers could use censorship to silence their critics. 
In conclusion restricting artistic liberties is a very complex issue which should be handled from a practical point of view. In principe, freedom of artists should be respected, but it leads to bad impacts in the society and government should restrict them.
