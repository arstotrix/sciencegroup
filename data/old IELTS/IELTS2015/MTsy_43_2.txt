Health problem has always been one of the most actual and controversial in some way. Governments give a lot of attention to increase the durance of lives and improve the conditions of living. One of the measures is being dine in many countries is increasing the number of sport facilities. On the one hand, people consider it as the best way of improving public health. Although others think it would not have enough effect on public health and another measures are needed to be done to solute the problem.
First of all, supporting the idea of increasing the number of sport facilities, it must be said that the result of this measure can be seen by researches who care about the activity and life longevity of people shows the real effect os such measure. So it cannot be denied that a part of people use the facilities suggested and it cause a positive effect on their health and life. This argument without doubt can convince governments to continue act like they were doing.
Unfortunately, some actions, supposed to be effective to solve the issue, can be not appropriate. When we are talking about the people who do not appreciate these sports facilities we must understand that it is normal and there will not be enough effect i this case. Some people just cannot do sport or do not want at least. Consequently, if they do not use the sport facilities, nothing will be improved. In some way, their belief can be true because their thoughts and actions are straightly affect solving the problem of public health.
Discussing the problem of public health, its improvement and all points of views is essential. All these views must be considered and the solvation must be made up according to them. As to me, increasing the number of sports facilities is vital and if someone do not assumpt it is effective, always will be somebody who cares about it and this measure will definitely help to improve health.
