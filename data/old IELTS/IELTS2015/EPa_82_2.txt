Ones think, that we should rise a number of sport activity. Othes don`t think so, because it have a little affect to our health. Is it true or false? We try to answer a bit later. 
On the one hand, increasing the number of sport facilities can help everyone to become healther. But it need some time for this, for example, we need to visit gym twice a week for 2 hour. Some people don`t have these time. Furthemore, to become stronger you should have some diet, if you don`t, any sport facilities can`t help you. On the other hand, without a huge number of sport facilities, you can`t find you sport, which you like and which is more usefull for you. So people will not doing sport well and then it will be a result of small effect for them. Another reason of small effect is wrong timetable. Your sports activity should be regulary, and at the one time. If you don`t follow your timetable, all you activity will had a bad result.
