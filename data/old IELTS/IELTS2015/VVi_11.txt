Many people think that creative artists should always had freedom toshow their own ideas in any way they wish. Others consider that the they wish. Others consider that the government must control they. I believe that it maybe good idea, but it can not be witout control.
First of all, sometimes artists can open a truth about daily peoples problems, like a traffic in a big cities or other. Also they can tell people about their vision of political problems and help people find a way to resolve this problems. Many people wos encouraged by poems and images for a great actions.
 On the other hand, if the goverment do not keep control on artists, we can have a different problems. Firstly, sometimes citizens can not understand what the artist want to tell to them. At the same time, some ideas may be crazy like a jumping from the building for a realistic film. Also artists can not know what politics or goverment want to by any action and they can change mention of people without reason. Some govement desigions can be understand only by specialist.
To sum up, I want to tell that sometimes government must give freedom to artists without changing anything, but only sometimes, because artists can make many problems. Art without control is a very dangerous  weapon.
