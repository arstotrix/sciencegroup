Task 2.
   Today it is a well-known fact that the level of public health is very interesting for the government. Also it is important for the society itself, and everyone finds their own way to keep fit. Comparing sports facilities with something else required, I would like to provide sports because it is close to the whole people.
   At first glance it may seem that people do not sports everyday. But it is completely wrong: in deed, everyone does some activities, and even if somebody does not play sports, it shows the lack of opportunity. The more sport facilities we have, the more people do sports.
   The second issue is to make sport facilities available to the whole ages. Moreover, we have to take care about the preference of the whole people. That is why some sport facilities could be set up in the playgrounds or in the backyard. It is better to think about some huge areas for tennis, football and other sports. Also it must come with the necessary service provided.
   What is more, we have to think about public interests. If we choose between the sport events with something else, it is the best way to encourage all the society to take care about their health. We can organize the tournaments and marathons for this purposes.
   To sum up, I would like to say that sport can make people feeling better. That is why we have to do sports, not only, watch them. So we have to provide more sport facilities to whole society, and it is better than any other way in this case.
