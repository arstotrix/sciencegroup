The charts below show the amount of population at different ages in per cent in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and forecast for 2050.
Population of both countries is divided into three groups: from birth till fourteen, from fifteen till fifty nine years old and more than 60 years old. In 2000 there was almost equal amount of the youngest and middle-aged group in Yemen, and only 3.6 per cent were people at age more than 60. However, the situation in Italy was quite different. There can be seen a marked prevalence of population at age between 15 and 59 years old, it is a little more than sixty per cent. Meanwhile, the oldest population was approximately one-fifth of the whole percentage and the youngest one consisted of nearly fourteen per cent.
The situation forecasted for 2050 in these countries differentiates from 2000. In Yemen it is supposed to be a growth of the population from 15 to 59 years old for a bit more than 10% while the youngest group is considered to decrease to 37%. Interestingly, the percentage of the oldest group has a slight growth for 2 per cent. On the other hand, in Italy this group is prognosed to rise until 42.3% while middle-aged population is supposed to fall down to 46.2% and the youngest group will remain almost constant.
Overall, the situation in 2000 and situation forecasted in both cities is rather different in contrast and it shows us what changes can happen with the population in future.
