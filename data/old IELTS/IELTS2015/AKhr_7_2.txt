Nowadays a question about freedom of self-expression is quite relevant. Many countries have some laws of just traditions of restricting arts. Some people believe that art can only develop in free circumstances, and no one has a right to disturb. Others think this position can cause different bad things. As I personally think, creation of pieces of art is not a business of governments. If somebody thinks about laws while making something wonderful (e.g. new film, song, picture), he would never be opened and sincer. People schould concentrate on just things which they create. I do not believe world can get a new masterpiece which was made according some strict rules. On the other hand, art can become offensive sometimes. For example, if a new film abuses one of the religions or discriminate some nations. In this case, of course, some rules should exist. However, it makes a big question: who will have a right to decide what is offensive and what is correct? Furthermore, a strong restricting of arts will cause a bad reaction. For instance, when Russian government made a law about controlling writers and journalists, there were some strikes and marches. That is why regulations in a sphere of arts are not such a good idea sometimes. To sum up, there are some different points in government restrictions of arts. One is that arts can exist only in free atmosphere without any rules. Another is that somebody's freedom can strongly influence others' lives. There is not one right desicion of this problem. Everybody should be responsible to his actions be himself.
