The column chart presents information about the post-school qualifications in Australia according to both genders in 1999.
It can be clearly seen that males got the skilled vocational diploma much more often than females did (10% for females against nearly 100% for males). By contrast, we could notice that getting the undergraduate diploma was more preferable for females than for males (70% vs 40%). This fact could be caused by the situation of getting married or pregnant for women when they had to give up their education. However, the number of student which got the bachelor's degree was not very high in both male and female sex, which was nearly 50%. In the next group, named 'postgraduate diploma' we are able to see a huge gap between males and females with the disbalance to men's side (70% of males reached the postgraduate diploma, with only 30% for females). But we should keep in our minds that a rather high percentage of Australians got the Master's degree in 1999. Certanely, 60% for males and 40% for females.
Overal, it is clear from the chart, that there was a rather high amount of well-educated people in Australia in 1999 with a easily-noticing disbalance to males, who seemed to be more educated.
