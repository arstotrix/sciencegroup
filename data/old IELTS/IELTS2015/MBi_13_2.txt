Nowadays there are a lot of universities all over the world which accept different numbers of male and female students in each subject. There is an opinion which says that the universities should accept equal numbers of student of both sexes in everu subject. Personally, I partly agree with this statement.
On one hand, there are a lot of advantages of including this trend into universities. We live in a democracy world where every person, not depending on a gender, has a right to have his/her own opinion. That is why, such lessons which contain equal numbers of male and female students may permit every person take active part in discussion. Such practice makes the lessons more exciting and more useful because it helps to save the democratic atmosphere in the university, furthermore, in the whole world.
One the other hand, there may be found some disadvantages of this practice. For example, sometimes, talking about certain professions, it is just impossible to accept equal numbers of male and female students. This example may be a surgerist. This profession is much more for men because it requires a big phisical power. Morever, there is a well-known fact that women are more sensible and more able to have sensitive feelings what can disturb from the job of surgerist or in military job, for example.
To conclude, there are always both advantages and disadvantages of each new trend, especially in the field of education. Although, there are many pluses, there are minuses.
