Nowadays, some groups of people consider that higher school should form study groups for different subjects consisted of the same number of male and female students.
	There are many points of view for this question and all of them, to any mind, are meaningful. Basically, all the viewpoints are built on the hypothesils of advantage and disadvantage of inequal number of students of both sex. For this I would highlight a number of reasons. First of all, there are some of researches happened in Stanford`s laboratory of social problems which have shown that group gives a higher results of studying when there is inequal number of students of both sex. Afterwards, having already managerial experience, I can confidently say that  a work group brings higher result while there is a sex disbalance. However, the whole raw of arguments may contradict my viewpoint. So, somebody can claim that the whole psychological climate in sex balanced groups is warmer hence the relationships between members are stronger, so the work made by such a group will be more efficient. One more reason to contradict mu position is to say a couple words about loyality. In groups with equal number this parameter is much higher and significantly influences on the situation in the group.
	In conclusion, I consider that universities should not accept the same number of males and females in every subject. In my opininon, this step would decrease the whole efficiency of study process.
