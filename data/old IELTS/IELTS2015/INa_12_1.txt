Task 1.
The charts show us the information on the ages in Italy and Yemen in 2000 and projections for 2050.
   At the first chart of Yemen we can see that in 2000 percentage of those who are from 0 to 14 (50,1%) is bigger than those who are from 15-59 (46,3%) and 60+ (3,6%). The projection for 2050 shows that the percentage of people form 15-59 will be 57,3%.  It is on 7% bigger than in 2000. The number of people from 0 to 14 will be smaller on 13,1 percent (50,1% in 2000 vs 37,0% in 2050). The number of people form 60 years old will increased from 3,6% to ???
   Now about Italy. Let`s compare both charts. first of all we can see that the number of 60+ people will increase (24,1% in 2000 and 42,3% in 2050). However, we can see that percentage of people from 15-59 in 2000 is bigger than it thought to be in 2050. The percentage of children in 2000 is 2,8% bigger than in 2050.
   It seems tha dynamic of population in Yemen is better. First of all the number of children will increase and the percentage of people in work-ages will grow.
