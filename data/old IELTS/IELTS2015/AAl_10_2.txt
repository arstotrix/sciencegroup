I strongly disagree with the given assumption , i don't even think that gender equality should be a principle at all. In my opinion, there are a lot of gender specialized spheres , and i think , that this specialization is based on basic biological and social differences between males and females. 
Throughout the history, men and women were always distinct  male jobs from female jobs , an the reason was nor the stereotypes , but biological features. At a whole, men are more physically developed , and more capable of doing a repeatable machanical work is much easier for them, such a clothing is . To specialize on a type of work you're best at, is the most efficient way to organise society.
Social aspect also helps with specialization , for example, barbers are more frequently women than men, because fashion is their sphere of interest.
However, there always are deviations , and we must wespect them, if a woman wants to become a mathematician, and has skills in math, we should never limit her ambitions. Some with a mon who wants to become specialist in fashion.
If universities ever would count gender as a decisive factor, the whole education system would be broken in my opinion. Why would a girl student care about the exams while she can go into the elite tech colleges , and be accepted only because she is a girl , and a gender equality heeds to be strained.
All organizations , from my point of view , should never care whether studen or employee or a candidate is a male or a female . Only thing that really matters is their personal skills and dedication. Maybe this way we will miss a gender equality, but we will achieve a much more important thing , the people equality.
