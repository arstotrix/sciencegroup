First of all I’d like to say, that I’m absolutely disagree with the given question. How universities could accept an equal numbers, depents only on the gender?! In a case of global (except two or three countries) situation, when the number of women is obviously higher, than men is. According to the given theory, 2% or 3% of female entering students have to be cancelled in entering the subject. Without prejudice, just because of «equal number of male and female students». Also, all male students have to be accepted, without any dependence of their knowledge level.

The second question, that I can notice in a (?)-stetement, is an extremely clear difference: there are too many men on a tech subjects, and on the other hand: too many women on civil subjects. I think, that it is normal, especially nowadays, when this difference becomes smaller and smaller. Anyway, as a rule, women are more emotional and common for all types of arts, while men can think more analicly.

Nowadays, the gender difference becomes empty, too far from reality. I’ve got a lot of friends from really tech faculties and universities, and they are women, and sometimes, they are really more successful than men. At the same time, plenty of my friends and me, study civils, and it’s really interesting, I guess we do some success in this subject!
