The pie charts below show us the degree of different parts of population in two countries in 2000 and for 2050. Yemen and Italy are divided by the level of economic development. In a first case, in Yemen we can observe that the half of population consists of young people under 14. The percentage of elderly people is rather small. In Italy the major part of population is presented by ages from 15 to 59 years. In addition, almost the quartile of the pie-chart includes elderly people. The prediction for 2050 is that the number of mature population would be decreased. Moreover, in comparison with 2000 there are less young people. Another significant issue is the difference between projections for 2050 in Italy and in Yemen. Yemen in 2050 is likely to be country with young population. At the same time, the pie chart shows that in Italy the quantity of people from 15 to 59 years old and elderly people would be almost equial. Young people would be more in Yemen.
