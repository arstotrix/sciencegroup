In the modern world many countries try to promote the environment for developing opportunities each person. Artists express their own ideas through music, pictures, sculptures, words but their own expression may be misunderstood by other people and may be estimated negative or even may be the cause of judicial prececution. Many people demand to make the boards for artists, but other people think that government restrictions is the actions of non-democratic countries. In my opinion, if we make boards for expressing of our own opinion, we can understand, that such boards can work against us. On the other hand, we should understand that we should not allow to express the opinion through paintings or music, which promote conflicts, disorders or making the damage to the state. Thus, we should make laws, which, on the one hand, constitute the boards for art, but, on the other hand, allow to express our own position independently on the governmental opinion. Likewise, our laws should be clear, since interpretation of the laws, which have unclear statement, depend on a court. For instance, in the USA only the court system have the right to interrupt the Constitution and all laws. Thus, the decision in a particular lawsuit depends on the interpretation of the law by the court. In other words, this problem demands considerable rational decision and I cannot suggest complex decision of this problem. In conclusion, I want to say, that each expression of own opinion must be possible, if such expression does not touch attitudes of other people.
