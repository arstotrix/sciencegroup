Writing task 2.
   Nowadays more and more people think about their health that makes it considerable question related to different sphere of our life. So, some people claim that the best way to develop public is to provide the greater number of sport facilities, while others believe that such kind of solution will not give positive results. In the present essay, I intend to compare both these points of view and represent my personal opinion.
   Firstly, looking through the view, supporting the established of additional sport facilities, it should be noticed that regular physical activities are the important part of our life. Some experts suggests that people need to excerise every day because it is not only useful and healthful for our muscles, but it also help us to keep our mental health stable. For instance, my friends always try to do some exercises after studying because it helps them to relax and avoid stressfull situations. Secondly, as it commonly known, the more facilities to do sports exist, the more people do them. As an example, nowadays there is a kind of trend to be healthy between different people, so they try to attend different sport classes or participate in extraordinary sport programms.
   Secondly, improving and establishing new facilities is only one of improving way. Notably keeping healthy diet also helps people to be in fit and keep themselves stronger. For example, my sister always try to eat natural food, drink enough water and avoid fast food, and this kind of approach gives her chances to be healthy.
   To sum up, I personally agree that it’s better to provide new sport facilities, but it is not enough, because the interest to do sports always depends on people’s character and relation.
