The question about number of freedom that people should have is very controversal. There is a lot of differen opinion about it. A lot of people think that creative artist should get as more freedom as possible. It's reasonable because thanks for freedom to express ideas we can enjoy using new technology, science medicines and offer wounderful things. In the middle age those, who create something new, have killed and there is no progress. Another important thing is that usually talanted artist like Visotsky, for example create antigovernment work, but this work reflects reality. It's wrong. Many people assume that government restriction is right, because there is danger of creation distroying ideas. It can be madness idea that one nation better than others. We have historical example World War II based on wrong idea. Nowadays many people express their ideas in different ways, but not all of this are good person with pieceful mind. We need strong regulator, which protect us and government are such regulator. All in all I think, that government restrictions, should be in our world, but not complitly. This restrictions shouldn't kill individuality, imagination and insperation of creative people, but should help clean our world from wrong and dangerous ideas.
