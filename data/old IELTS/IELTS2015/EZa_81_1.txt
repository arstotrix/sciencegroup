The bar chart gives information about the level of qualification between men and women, who are living in Australia. This comparison was provided in 1999.
We can see from the bar chart that percentage of men who had a skilled vocational diploma were the biggest and reached approximately 95 percentages. Also percentage of men who had a postgraduate diploma exceed percentage of women almost twice. Sixty percentage of people who had master’s degree also were males. However, three quarter of people who had undergraduate diploma were females.
If we see on people who had bachelor’s degree, that we can mark that differences between them was a very slight and females won the race only on 8 percentages.
Overall, we can say that females rarely have a skilled vocational diploma. Thus, females prefer undergraduate and males prefer postgraduate.
