Universities should accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. To what extend do you agree or disagree?
The idea of making university equal – for boys and girls? Sounds good. But I don’t like the way, how authors want to make it real. On the one hand – when in class teacher had the same proportion of both sex – it’s a good posibility to work with gender differences in different areas of science – because there will be a lot of opinions from both sides. But on the other hand, - which one is scary me more – how in our real life universities will try to do this. Maybe they will make a rough rools for student, maybe someone won’t go to the class he wants – because there, for example, will be enough boys.
The main aid if universities should be quality of the education they made not the numbers of female (or male) students at the course. And for this equity they should make good options and good atmosphere  for learning and studing both sides of the medal – female and male. That missunderstanding is very important – not every teacher can think that way. Maybe someone has different opinion because if his historical country development – or religion, or smth else. It shouldn’t be a problem.  
So, because of that reasons, I can’t agree with the statement – idea is good, but not quite good in reality situation. 
In conclusion I would like to say that now some big and famous universities have a problem with gender stereotypes – maybe some girl wants to have military education – and for her it’s impossible.
Or there is an another situation – when a male student wants to be a designer, but he will be the only man in this group because of the speciality.  So, to solve these problems with gender character, university should do something else exept making the numbers equal, and try a few different ways – like making a non – gender ads or organize a special help for not ordinary students.
