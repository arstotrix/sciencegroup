Creative people must incarnate their ideas in live. And goverment don't be forbid to do it this.


I agree wich whis opinion becouse people must be developed his ideas. But than don't disturb rule. For this thing. They can do everything if they don't disturb rule. They can incarnate his ideas in everything in words, in pictures in music or film. But this thing must be ansver over ruless. If creative people don't to incarnate ideas. Not anyone isn't replase theare. And people can leave whis out pictures, music and films. Live it can be become not interesting, simple and beutifale.


Coverment mustn't be forbid creative artists incarnate his ideas. Becouse creative people do this very good and they don't do samthing else. For example ierish actor Mateu Makkonoxe is very best, they win oskar and little people can like he. Or Kura Naitly it is very beautiful women and beeter in film-play and her too repead dificalt.It him that more creative people simple people don't be repead. But creative people don't be super all. They have good and bad ideas and almost they cann't incarnate them. Or do this not bad but not Fartasly. Sometimes more people can repead his ideas. But don't think out like ideas. They can alone repead and this is don't be interesting and creative.


Finally I want to say that goverment musn't sappress creative artist incarnate his ideas, becouse live become not interesting. And artist don't save.
