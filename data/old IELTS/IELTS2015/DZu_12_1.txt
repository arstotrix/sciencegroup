The table below illustrates the information about the Underground Railway Systems of different cities.
Overall, all the Railway Systems were opened at the same period of time (in 200 years). However, there are many differences in size of the route and amount of passengers per 1 year.  The oldest Railway System of London has the longest route. It is twicely bigger than the route of Paris (199 km to 394). Although, the number of passengers of London’s Railway Station per year is only a third part of the amount of passangers of Tokyo’s Railway System (775 millions to 1927). The Washington DC’s Railway system has approximately the same numbers in kilometres of route and passengers per year (126 and 144).
In contrast to other Railway Systems, the ones in Kyoto and Los Angeles are the smallest: LA’s system has only 28 km of route and Kyoto’s Railway is only a half of it (11 km). However, both of Railways have the same amount of passengers per year (45 and 50).
