It is a well-known fact that once a student finishes his school-he is likely to use his freedom in all the possible ways.  The period between finishing high school and starting university studies is known for its absolute freedom and great variety of ways to spend leisure time. Despite this fact, there are still some benefits and drawbacks of decisions to work or travel wherever. 
First of all, if young people are encouraged to travel, they will have much possibilities to improve their life. They can easily get acquainted with any foreigners or other amazing people, that  they would use this huge experience lately. Secondly, if the person chooses working, he would undoubtedly develope necessary skills for future career. Gaining professional and personal experience is the most important part in career promotion. Making such decision, people are eager to use the possible chance in their life to earn money for future. 
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages in favour of staying in a home town. As people choose travelling, they should ensure that their precious time worth it. After the person starts university studies, he leaves his family for a long time. So, why do not people just spend their free time before studying with relatives? Secondly, when travelling people may easily lose good terms with some friends as well as miss the situations happening in their families. Choosing working instead of travelling the free year is the last chance, probably, to relax before hard studying. It is extremely important to get ready for university studies in a unwind atmosphere. Anyway, it is much better rather than spending all the time on working.
In conclusion, I would like to notice that everyone chooses the way of life he will be then satisfied with. Surely all the pros and cons should weighed up and taken into attention when making the right decision.
