Nowadays investigation states that people's initial characteristics and qualities impact on our personality and development in more significant way than experiences we may gain in our life.
In general, it is clear that characteristic we are born with is a foundation of our future development, in this way, initial qualities define your personal development way. For example, people who are attracted by math since childhood and like figures in future will hardly cope with literature to foreign languages. Take me, for example, it is easy for me to solve math or economics, while it I'd difficult to learn a open by heart. In this way, I believe that basing on our mental initial characteristics we should choose the way of development, as it isn't useful to evolve spheres which you are not tend to.
On the other hand, physical initial characteristics may also affect on future development and even perform completely. However, governments are trying to make conditions in which injure people can perform and develop equally with normal people. For example, we can injured people in universities and they are studying with their friends and it I'd a normal tendency.
To conclude, I strongly believe that mental initial characteristics we are born with have the major influence as physical gaps are not a problem today
