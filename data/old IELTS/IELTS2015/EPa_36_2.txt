Nowadays, many people consider that sport makes us healthy and that by developing sports conditions we can build a helthy and strong nation. However, others are sure that the strategy of developing sport is not so effiecently as we imagine.
It is generally accepted that if you go in for sport then you are going to be healthy. There are a lot of stereotypes of sports people. Some find it good at carier. Man who goes in for some activity means succesful man. But it is individually, not for ever gone. If the goverment decided to increase the number of sports facilities it does not mean that all people decided to go in for sport: some of them, moreover, are not able to do it.  For instance, it doesn`t have effects on desabled people. New sports facilities and opportunities bring nothing for them. 
At the opposite side, people think the goverment should improve public health in another way. If the goverment would decide to increase sports facilities the encouraging in sport may not t work. Some people are lazy, others have no time for exesizes.
All in all, I would like to share my point of view. I suggest it needs to create some motivating projects and programms. In this case, we should explain people why it is important to do sports. We should give many reasons so people would like to do it. Also it needs to develop some goverments` programms for disabled people. We have to give charees for all. By the way, we may achieve public health in alternative ways. It is like ban fast food.
