These diagrams shows us the situation about the population of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and the prediction for these countries in 2050. There are some simmilar trends and some differences. Let us observe it more carefully and make some conclusions.


The main differences in developing of these two countries. Italy is a developed country and there are more noticable process of eldering population (from 24 per cent to 42) then in the third world country which is called Yemen. There is a a small shift in 2,1 per cent. But due to the process of globalisation there are the simmilar trends of tho groups: decreasing of 0-14 years' group and increasing group 60+. What about group 15-50 years, there are controversal trends in these two countries. Prediction talk about increasing in 11 per cent for Yemen and slighting blown in 18 per cent for Italy.


In addiction I should say that the situation can be more noticable if we would be able to compare number of this groups in both countries.
