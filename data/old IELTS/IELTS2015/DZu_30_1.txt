The table below illustrates the information about underground in six cities. Overall, Tokyo has the biggest passenger per year indicator, with the number of 1927 millions.
It’s noticeable that London underground is the oldest one. Whats more, it’s biggest one, if we look at the route kilometres indicator. The youngest one is Los Angeles underground, but it’s already bigger than Kyoto’s, which was opened twenty years before. As I have already said, Tokyo’s underground have more passengers than any other one that listed, but it’s not to be the biggest. It’s 44 kilometres smaller than in Paris, and almost twice smaller than Londons.
It’s also obvious that the only subway that was opened in this century is Los Angeles one. All the others was found in 20th or even 19th century. Despite the fact that London subway is the biggest one, there are just 775 millions passangers per year, and this is just the third indicator. On a second and first place there are Paris and Tokyo, with 1191 and 1927 million passangers per year.
