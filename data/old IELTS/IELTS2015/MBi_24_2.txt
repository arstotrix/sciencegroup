Nowadays it is clear that every person should be able to get the education desined. Yet in some universities a huge difference between the amount of male and female students studyin can be noticed. In my opinion, this situation is absolutely normal and should not be controlled by any specific measures.
First of all, the difference between the amount of male and female studying a certain subject in a university can be caused not by the politics of this university but the natural interest of different genders in different fields of knowledge. For example, men tend to be more interested in science, while women are more attracted to humanities. Another reason for which universities should not allow only the same number of male and female students in classes is that it may lead to situations when people who want to take a certain class can not enroll in it only because of the gender policy of a university. Thus, such measures would not prevent inequality but support it. Finally, allowing only same amount of male and female students in classes would only increase discrimination and not support tolerancy. This policy would be based on judjing people by their gender and not by their intellectual capacities.This is why it is unacceptable for both men and women.
To conclude, I have to say that allowing only same amount of male and female students in every class seems to be a uselles and irrelevant way of fighting against the discrimination. In my opinion such policy would not lead to any positive results and would only produce obstacles for future students. I am positively sure that students must be able to enroll in a certain class not for gender reasons but judjing on their intellectual abilities, which can be measured by standartised and objective tests.
