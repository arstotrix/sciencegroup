It is obviously nowadays that the issue of public health has significant influence on modern life. Some people suppose that the large number of sports facilities is a key to solve the problem . At the same time, others do not agree with it. The first thing that need to be said is the quality is more important than quantity. The quality of sport facilities depends on government’s decisions. Secondly, another measure to improve public health is popularization of sports facilities at whole. For example, if the government of south country provides a comfortable and convience residence for hockey, it does not mean that this kind of sports will be popular in this country. However, another side of the coin is increasing number of sports facilities. Some people do believe that the large number will provide the development of sport’s situation. In conclusion, I would like to underline that the best way to improve public health is just do sport wherever you are every day. Personal perception is more significant factor in this problematic issue. However, doubtless, that government decision and social opinion have great influence on the development of sport in a country.
