The energy consumption of the average Englishmen is not much different from the citizens of any other developped country. Let us look closely at the chart and graphs demonstrating more precise data.
The first and most obvious trend shown at yhe graph is that the consumption of the electricity in summer is much less than in the winter. There can be seen similar trends in both seasons - a smooth fall from approximately 3 hours to 9 hours i the morning, then rocketing for more than 10000 units. The summer graph reaches a peak at 14 hours and then smoothly fluctuates and goes at the bottom of 15000 units at 24 hours. the winter graph hits a peek at 48000 units at 22 hours and then plummets down to 3200 units at 24 hours, almost lowest point.
talking about differences more closely, we can see that because of the abscence of the main energy-demanding need, central heating, the summer trend does not rise above the figure of 20000 units of electricity. comparing it with the energy demand off the winter, we can simply calculate thet heating takes approximately 20000 units of electricity. Some other risings and little differences are the expences of the cold, people need more heat to feel themselves comfortable.
To draw up a conclusion, I wouldsay that because of the low temperatures and less vitamins in winter. People hace to heat their flats, eat more and have more hot drinks than in summer.
