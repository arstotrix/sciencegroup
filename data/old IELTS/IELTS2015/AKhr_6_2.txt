Everyone knows that in a modern world artists have a big freedom of expression in comparison with the past experience. However, some people think that they should have limitations to create even no. Personally, I think that people who create something are not allowed to be limited by some rules. First, the freedom of expression is the main factor to achieve originality for artists. If there are some restrictions, creative people will not be able to make something special as all of the works of artists will be quite similar. Second, with no freedom masterpieces will not be of high quality. If an artist is limited in some frames, it will be difficult for him to make something that people like. The reason is that it will not be practically the same as he or she wants us to see. As opposed to the above ideas, some people are sure that artists are to be restricted on some features. For example, writers or editors of magazines should be accurate saying about politicians and artists drawing them. I suppose that in this way people who always create just do not have a chance to express their personal point of view. Thus, they will not get any satisfaction from what they do. To conclude, I do believe that in a comtemporary society the government should restrict people to create whatever they want. It is just more fascinating to see the real opinion that is not limited by someone's interests.
