The diagrams represent the information on the age differentiation of people in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and possible future situation in 2050.
It is obvious, that the beginning of the 21st century there are more kids in Yemen (50,1%) than in Italy (14,3%). The number of people, whose age rauges from 15 to 59 years, is approximately the same for both countries, however, the difference is about 15%. There are not so many old people in Italy â€“ only 24,1% - but in Yemen this number is the least and comprises 3,6% from the whole population. 
The projections for 2050 show that there would be a lot more elderly people in Italy than in Yemen. Young and middle-aged populations would be similar for both countries (57,3% for Yemen and 46,2% for Italy). Definetely, the number of kids and teenagers in Yemen would dominate over the number of the Italians in the same category (37,0% against 11,5%).
To conclude, I would like to say that these charts demonstrate the dynamics of changes in the population of Italy and Yemen.
