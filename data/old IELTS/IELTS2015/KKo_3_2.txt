In the modern world when the rythm of life is so fast and people are so busy, one of the most important questions is the problem of the public health. There is an opinion that the increase of the variety of sport facilities can solve this problem. However, other people think that it’s not the right way and it won’t help somehow.
First of all, the bigger number of the sport facilities can solve the situation with the health, because it’s a good way of giving people different opportunities. Secondly, if such facilities are able for everyone and are free or not so expensive, this may encourage people to try something new in their life. Moreover, the increase of the sport facilities can be the cause of the new trends such as, for example, healthy lifestyle. This can led to a good impression on the society and the public health will be improved.
On the other hand, it is necessary to remember that if a person does not want to take care on his health, nothing can persuade him, or only a strong disease. And that is the main reason why the variety of sport facilities might be useless.
Personally I strongly believe that by increasing the number of sport facilities it is possible to solve only a part of the problem. As a whole it can be solved only by giving people an idea as a healthy lifestyle is something good, useful and worth doing. Here can be used advertisements, TV programmes etc.
To sum up, public health needs to be improved in different ways. Not only one method of changing sport facilities’ number can be used here, as it was said earlier. That is why the government and all the people should think and maybe invent something new and unusual to make every person starting taking care of his health.
