How different people define the word “happiness”? What it means for them to be happy? We cannot easely answer this question; while this defenition means different for particular persons, but still there are some factors that can help to achieve  this feeling.
First of all, happiness for rich and poor people means different things. To define rich and poor, for instance, we can look at some African citizens, who are starving. For them a small rain, during hot and killing days may be the greatest pleasure, and people, who are leaving in big cities always judging such days. People who have nothing know how to be happy ones by finding a small, unexpected present on the street. For others it is much harder to be happy. When you have all, nothing can suprise you. To reach happiness people need to stop being always angry and tired, they need to find the way to feel, better about everyting that happening around them.
Nevertheless, happiness is not only things around it is also people that are close to you: family and friends. It is well known that children, that grow up in half families sometimes have lack of happiness than people from normal ones. Also, became unhappy when they are treated bad at schools, universities and even at work. But in spite of the relationships in groups it is more sagniffecient when the things that you do makes you happy. When a person is complitely in work, in most cases he achiev happiness.
In conclusion, it is hard to define happiness, and for different people different factors lead to that feeling. In my opinion, the real happiness can come not only after a hard work, even if sometimes it is an important factor, but also it may appear from any corner of the life.
