All people are borned with different characters. Some of them are passion, others are active. However, whether have the characteristics we have from our birth more influence on our personality than experiences that we get in our life? I am deeply convinced, that it is not so. This essay is meant to view arguments for experience is more prominent than the characteristics we are born with.
First of all, any abilities must be developed. It is difficult to imagine, that all talented people were born with their great abilities in doing something. For instance, Mozart who was a musician and composed amazing music, trained for hours every day with his farther. He did not stop his study and it helps him to achieve great results in music.
Secondly, only experience that people get in their life help to realize their mistakes and make a character stronger. So, some people can be born in happiness and their childhood is wonderful and careless, however after the death of someone they must face reality and understand how to live. This example shows, that any experience is much important and it influences on our personality more than the characteristics we were born.
To draw the conclusion, I would like to say, that the answer to the question could be different. Nevertheless, only experience can change a person and makes him better. At the same time, people who cope with problems, have a stronger character.
