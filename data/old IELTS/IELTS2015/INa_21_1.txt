   The graphs show comparison between ages of the population of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and in 2050 as a prediction. 
   It is pictured that people in Yemen in 2000 year are rather young, 50, 1% of group “0-14 years” and 46, 3% of  “15-59 years”, while 60+years population is only 3, 6%. In contra to these points, at the same time period in Italy there are more old people then teenagers and adults. So that, only 14, 3% for “0-14 years”, 61, 6% for “ 15-59 years” and enormous 24, 1% for “60 + years”, which is much bigger than tiny 3, 6% in Yemen. In 2050 the situation in both countries would dramatically change. Yemen will have about 57, 3 for adults, 37% for teenages and only 5, 7% for old people. According to diagram, “60 + years” group in Italy will increase to shocking 42, 3%, while 0-14 years and “15-59 years” declined in big numbers.
   To sum up, the negative tendence of oldering population is well seen on these charts. Nevertheless percents in Yemen are more optimistic, than in Italy, where population is going to miss its young part.
