Task 1.
   The diagram provides the statistics regarding percentage of people in Yemen and Italy in 2000, in terms of 3 age groups and predictions for  2050.
   Basically, it can be seen that the population of people who above the age of 60 is expected to increase, while number of children is going to become lower in both countries in 2050. In 2010 children under the age of 14 were a half of all people living in Yemen, but in 2050 it is predicted that children will make-up only 37% of the whole population. The same ploblems are seen in Italy. 14,3 % in 2010 will low down to 11,5 % in 2050.
   By 2050 it is also anticipated that the percentage of people above the age of 60 will increase. From 3,6 % to 5,7 % in Yemen and from 24,1 % to 42,3 % in Italy. The difference between two countries is connected with predictions concerning people of middle age (15-59 years). In Yemen an upward trend is expected (rise from 46,3 % to 57, 3%), while in Italy downward trend is predicted (fall from 61,6 % to 46, 2 %).
   In conclusion, it is vital to say that prediction basically let us realize a future tendency according to which both countries will face a decrease in childrenâ€™s population on the one hand, and increase in population of older people on the other.
