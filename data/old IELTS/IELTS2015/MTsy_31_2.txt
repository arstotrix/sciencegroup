Nowadays the question of public health is the reason of discussion in many countries.
But, to analaze the fact of improvment a public health through increasing the number of sports facilities, would be better to look at the consequences of such decision in Russia.
Todays we can watch rapidly growing popularity of street workout. this kind of activity based on using elementary sports facilities. Became in our country little time ago. Now the government stimulate it through increasing the number of sports facilities by colladoration with activists organisations. So this example diffyinately shows that it is a good way.
From the other side this can't be enough to improve public health at any category of age. It very good useful among young people, who need some more special equipment for improve the health without dangerous. Because these uncontrolled workouts can impact in bad way to old people.
So in my opinion this practice not enough to improve the health of the population in common. But this is a good part of bigger program of public health than if to only increase the number of sports facilities.
