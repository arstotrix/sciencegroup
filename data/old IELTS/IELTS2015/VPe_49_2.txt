It becomes a very significant topic that there should be provided a possibility of equal numbers of male and and female students in every subject learned in universities. In my opinion it is really good decision to provide equal numbers of students of difrent sexes in different disciplines. 

There are some reasons, why I think it is useful and even important to support this point of view. First of all this idea is actual because it supports the human rights which give us freedom to choose our path in different parts of life, for example, we are free to choose what discipline we want to learn independable on our sex. It means that boys are able to choose technical subjects nor only because they are boys and it means that girls will not look silly in the technical or math’s classes only because they are girls. 
The second reason I think this point of view should supported is a possibility of appearing amount of famous researchers and scientists in different disciplines where male personse were in majority. For example  Mari – Pierre Quirry became a great physician, but it was considered , that women should not learn such sciense as physics or maths; so Mari remain the only famous women who made a breakthrough in physics. According to the topic of this work we are able to discover a lot of talented woman in such disciplines as physics and maths so it can become an impact to new scientific revolution. 
To sum it up I can say that idea of equal number of male and female students in different subject can be significant in further development of different branches of science and it would become useful for a whole humanity.
