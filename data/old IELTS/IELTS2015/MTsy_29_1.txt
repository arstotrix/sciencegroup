The diagrams shows information about the ages of population in Italy and Yemen in 2000 and predictions for 2050.
In 2000 the main difference in age structure was in number of yoth people (0-14 years) - in Italy it was only 14 per cent and in Yemen - half of population. Adults were 60 per cent of Italy population and 46 per cent in Yemen. Old people (60 plus years) was a quater of Italy population and just 4 per cent in Yemen.
This could be explained by differences between Italy and Yemen life levels. Yemen is a poor Aisian country and for this type of states huge amount of children is usual. Italy is developed European country with small amount of children in total population, but big of adults and old men. Obviously, part of old men will increase and part of children- decrease in both countries.
This conclusions can be proved by projections for 2050. Total amount of children will be decreased: to 37 per cent in Yemen and 11 per cent in Italy. The number of old people will be increased to almost a half of population in Italy and only to 5 per cent in Yemen. It is connected with bigger life countinuing in Italy.
