Artists should have freedom to express their emotions and feelings in ways they like. There should be no government restrictions on their works.
Current problem is extremely urgent nowadays. Some people are sure that art should live in its "pure" way without any restrictions. While others believe that some works should be forbidden.
In same way art without any restrictions is reasonable. First and foremost, art is about expressing personal feauters, individual traits. And that would not be fair to form some frames and rules on artists works. Moreover, if we are speaking of liberalism and pluralism, that means that every person can express his feelings and emotions in different ways. And noone in this situation can say what is wrong and what is right. However, some people claim the opposite opinion. They are sure that forming restrictions on works of art is a good idea. They have several reasons for that. First of all, some works of art can propose immoral and cruel ideas, which can influence badly on people and their relations. Some people can interprete art in their own way and it can lead to terrorism and war. Futhermore, children, teenagers and adolecsents have an unformed mind when, can be easily unfluenced and effected in a wrong way. For instance, it is scientifically proved that after some films there was a high level of murders and thefts. 
To sum up, making restrictions on works of art is not right, but in some cases it can be very useful and helpful.
