Public health is supposed to be one of the most substential factors influening the standard of living all over the world. That is why its improving is reguarded as a chief goal of every country and every government. The increasing of sport facilities is one of the methods to do this. Yet, some other people think that the range of measures is wider and sport development is not enough to achieve the goal. So, let us think it over.


First of all, the development of sport can encourage teenagers to refuse their bad habbits like drinking alcohol and smoking and to show them a better way of their personal development. This somewhat determines the improving of public health in the future, when all of these young people will grow up. More than that, growing amount of sport facilities can be a remedy to avoid some other kind of addiction â€“ computer addiction, which is commonly believed to be a serious problem among teenagers in our contemporary world of modern technologies.


On the other hand, it should be mentioned that physical activities can not ensure the sharp improving of public health, because there are people suffering from different deseases. And this problem could be solved by various social projects in order to help such people with money for their treatment, for instance. Undoubtly, this aspect of public health improving is on the shoulders of governments.


To conclude, I absolutely agree with the statement that sport facilities are essential for health of population as a whole. Yet, there are some other effective measures that may alter the outcome. Improving of health care is the challenge that governments must face.
