Talented people should feel free to expess their ideas. Some people believe that government should let doing them what they want. I tend to agree with this statments. 
First of all, artist is a kind if people, who love freedom. And for working they need inspiration. They always invent something new. If government do not let do it, we never read remarkaple books and never see inspirational pictures. For example, picture of Van Gogh, poems of Pushkin and others.
There was not cuture development in USSR, because government have main strong idea, any others were forbidden. As a result, many talented persons imigrated to Europe and America, because they can not do what they want in Russia.  As an illustration, Ivan Bunin, Anna Akhmatova and another great writers, unfortunatly, left Russia. But those writers, artist, who stayed, were sent to Siberia prisons or were died. 
But on the other hand, some artist idea is dangerouse for people and has negative influence on environment and culture. For example, young bays, who is keen on graffity always damage vail train, walls, wondeful buildings. As for me, government should make some restrictions on what they do.
In conclusion, I believe that artist should have freedom to do something new, to create, to express their ideas. But at the same time, artist should be responsible of what they do. People should to find right balance between, what is good and what is bad.
