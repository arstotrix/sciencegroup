Some people believe that if we want to be healthier, we should spend more time on sport activities. But others do not agree with it. Let us try to consider wich point of view is more correct.
   There is no doubt that sport activities have a positive effect on our health and well-being. For instance, it is proved, that people who run every day have less problems with the heart. Moreover, doctors always advice to do exercises in the morning to prevent illnesses. In my point of view, the government, should promote sport in the country. For example, they can built sport ground, stadiums, increase the number of free of charge sport activities in order to all people will be able to go in for sports. So, I absolutely agree with the statement that the more sport we do the heaethier we are.
   However, there is another point of view. Some people do not suppose that sport has a good effect on people’s health. Probably, they think that you can be injured doing sport or something else. Or they just think that in order to improve people’s health the authorities should firstly improve the medicine in country, built more new hospitals, make medicine free of charge.
   To sum up, in my point of view, a person should care about his health himself. And on of the best way to do it is to go in for sports. I suppose the government should help people by giving them the opportunities for sport activities.
