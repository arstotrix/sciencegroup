Writing task 2.
   Today, there are a lot of people who would argue that by increasing the number of sports facilities we will easily overcome the problem of poor public health. But other people would say that there are a lot of other measurements which we can apply nowadays to improve public health.
   I personally agree, with whose who think that there are a lot of other solutions of this problem. I would say that government can make a lot of laws which can change the whole country to a healthier way. For example, there is a widespread practice that in some schools children can have more P.E. lessons a week, and statistics from this exploration can say that children who have more P.E. lessons are healthier than their peers from other schools, whatâ€™s more, if government will make all the sports schools and clubs free many children from low-class families will have a chance to go in for sports.
   On the other hand, many people can still argue that the number of sport facilities can make a difference in our struggle with poor health. But I think that quantity is not nessessarily mean quality. In some way, having available football fields, gyms and tennis courts is good for people, but without coaches this facilities become useless.
   I suppose, that any type of activity which we try to do, needs promoting and encouragement. Promotion should be based on movies, articles, stories which can be noticed by everybody. Also, we need to get encouragement from our family. Parents need to promote a healthy way of life and show on examples to their children what is good for your health and what is harmful.
   In conclusion, I would like to say that all people are different, and all of them have various opinions. But I am sure that only government and family can turn the public health to a right way. Having many sports facilities is not enough nowadays, because without proper observation it became useless.
