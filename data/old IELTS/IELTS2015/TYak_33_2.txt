There is a lot of problems with teenage behavior at school. They can be caused by many peasons and teachers and parents should deal with them, try to solve their child problems.

	In my opinion, there is several number of problems which cause severe questions with school students behavior. First of all, when you are 14 – 16 you want attention and sometimes popularity, you want to be “cool”. Some boys become bullies, some girls starts to smoke or tryes to look older. Secondly, I think, problems can be hide in psycology. When you are  in your teen age you don’t have enough knowledge or experience to understand who you are, to find yourself, thats why children change so much at the ae of 14 to 16. There is one more thing, that I should mention. I don’t know why, but I can call it “personal” experience, when you are at you 15 you think, that whole world is agains you: teacher are awful; parents just criticize you werytime; your friends are too smart or too stupid for you; you don’t have love of your life, so, tu sum up all of that, you think, that your life stops, and you are scared, you don’t know what to do and when you try to fight with whole world, try to be rude, on your own; try to break all rules which cause to bad social behavior and problems in cash part of your life.

	In conclusion, I want to suggest to play more attention to students social lifes, not to their marks or home works. Of course it is  important, but more important is to be sure, that you child, your student can deal with all teenage problems, to help them with his problems, to show, that they are not alone.
