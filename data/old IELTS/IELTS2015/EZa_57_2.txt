The world has a lot of different spheres, such as politics, economics and the art. Artists are very creative and talented people who should be free from government's ristricts. But some people tthink that this idea is wrong and dangerous for the society. 
On the one hand in my opinion, artists are citizens of countries and they should not break rules, because such people can be extremely dangerous for everyone. For example, an artist can thinks that breaking statues is a magnificant idea to express that the past has gone, but statues are the part of culture which should be saved for next generations. Moreover, it is wrong idea to show someone that he or she is better than others and give this person special rights, as other people can make a revolution and break down the old government. For instance, there was such kind of discrimination in Reich. 
On the other hand, some people suppose that artists are much more interesting than the office plancton and it is important to give them freedom as, firstly, this kind of people can give the society new ideas, make others more open-minded. What is more, such tipe of freedom helps people to cope with pressure or stressful situations. Painting or music helps children to decrease their pain. 
But, to my mind,  artists can express themselves in the frame of rules and the law. And when they break rules it is noit valuable art. 
To sum it up, I should say that this idea has pros and cons, but, in my opinion,everyone should express himself or herself in terms of law. And artists are not exception.
