There is an interesting situation on pie chart in Yemen in 2000. As we can see the marketable trend that all population of Yemen consists in the whole of such groups of population as children to 14 years and 15-59 year-people. They are approximately equal. And it almost aspent a group of 60+ years-people. As the predictions for 2050, the percentage of 15-59 years-people will increase by more than 10 points. And the number of 60+ years-people will be higher and will at about 6percent.
But in Italy there is another situation in 2000.  The percentage of children to 14 years is much smaller than in Yemen in the same year and it is only 14,3 points. But the number of elder people is much greater than in Yemen and it is approximately a quater. In projections of the population of Italy there is an overall trand for declining of medium-aged group by near the 15 percents. But the percentage of elder people will peak by 1,5 times. And the number of children will almost remain stable in 2050.
