Nowadays, education plays the one of the most important role in our life, government and society are trying to improve it. Teachers at school share their own knowledge with pupils, prepare them to the future difficult life, and of cource all of them face up to some problems connected with pupil behaviour.

To my mind, there is a great range of things, which influence the behaviour.

First of all, students mood, wants to study depends on family, parents and problems at home. For example, you can feel bad and be agressive at school if at home your brother make you do extra execises for lessons, threat on you.

Secondly, the environment has a great influence on us. It is very to keep the good behaviour if people donâ€™t understand you, you have no friends and teachers give a bad marks.

Thirdly, modern education system have a lot of minuses, many aspects should be redescover. For example, scientists  prove that it is hard for people to pay attention to the lesson more than 15 minutes it if is boring. Teachers must provide new educational systems to improve pupils results, make them be interested in the subject.

To sum up, the main aspects that cause problems with student behaviour is situation in family, surrounded society, teachers and friends and, of course, education system which is provided by scientists.
