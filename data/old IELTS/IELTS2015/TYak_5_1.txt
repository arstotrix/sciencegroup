	The charts below gives us interesting information about travelling in the UK. The first graph depicts how many english people travel abroad to spend their holidays and how many foreigners choose the UK as a place to go to. Looking at it I get the impression that in general travelling sphere is being developed, since during the whole period from 1979 to 1999 both characteristics experienced a noticeable growth. For instance, at the end of the period there are 5 times more visits to foreign countries managed by english people and approximately 3 times more visits to the UK by foreigners.

	Another graph is more detailed and shows us information about countries that are usually visited by english. The most popular  country among eglish is France. Almost 12 millions visited it in 1999; whereas only 2 millions visited Turkey in the same year.

	To sum up, as we can see, travelling sphere in the UK has been developing for last 30 years. The main reason that english people in general became much richer and more independent.
