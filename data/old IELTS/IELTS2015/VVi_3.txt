Number of womans who have undergraduate diplomas almost two times higher then number of mans. Bachelor’s degree was held by almost the equal proportion of mans and womans. Proportion of females who held Master’s degree is 40% compared with just over 30% womans with postgraduate diplomas. On the other hand, there is completely different situation with males – about 70% own postgraduate diplomas, in contrast only 60% of mans held Master’s degrees.
