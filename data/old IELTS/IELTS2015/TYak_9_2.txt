Schools in many countries have problems with students’ behaviour. Let us consider causes of these problems and find solution of them.

There are a lot of children with really bad behaviour, and teachers cannot deal with this problem, because any punishment does not work. The first cause of students’ behaviour is family conditions. A lot of families all over the world do not care about bringing up their children as well. The other cause of the behaviour problem is social conditions. Many children can be included to bad companies and do things that members of these companies do, like drinking alcohol, smoking. The third reason is that to much information is allowed to children now, including films, serials or books which can have bad influence on children’s mind.

There are several ways to solve students’ behaviour problem. Firstly, teachers should not punish students, because it really does not help to stop children doing bad things. Secondly, there should be strong rules in every school. And finally, teachers should talk to students’ parents at least once a month to avoid any problem.

All in all, I want to say that solving the problem of children’s behaviour at school is quite significant for modern society, because “children are our future”. If we want our future to be better than present, we should do something. For example, parents ought to bring their children up as good persons. “Children’s behaviour is not a school problem, but it is a family problem.
