Today popular quation is about unpaid community service and should it be compulsory part of high school or should not.
To begin with, the major part of volonteeres, who worked in unpaid community service are students and schoolers. If this service be a part of school, students will have better conditions of working. For example they may have some extra points in the school while working. Also, students will have the opportunity both to work and stydy at the same time.
What is more, if theis service become a part of the schools, this communitys will be advertised by schools and so that more numbers of volonteeres will work there. Students will talk with each other about this kind of work. And school will promote in class this work. All this will lead to increasing the number of workers.
Moreover, this kind of work will teach students responsibility. Working as a volonteere make students to grow up mentaly and be responsible.
Another big advantage of this situation is that students, spending there free time in school. This will prevent them from street influence. Such as drugs, alchogol and robbening.
The last reason, why school and unpaid communitys should be unite is government donate. If this two organisations will be unite, government will donate more money to school. This will provide more equipment both to school and to charity. This fact will increase the effectivity of the volontere work and also will increase the number of students, involved in this work.
All in all, there are a lot of argument for compresing this both organisations in one.
