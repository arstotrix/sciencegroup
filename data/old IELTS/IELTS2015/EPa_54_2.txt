People have been thinking about public helth and triing to improve it since time immemorial. Today we still develop our knowledge about health and factors, which influence it. In this essay I try to describe such factor as sport, and link of it with health. 
Nobody can deny that sports facilities inprove our feelings, health and bodys. I think that in this way we can help our body to save tonus. For example, nowadays there are a lot of different kinds of gim schools, where people with different skills should do exersices. In this schools trainer takes into consideration all fitches of people especially their health. 
Secondly I can say that all people have favorite sport. If they have possibility to do this sport, they will have a good mood. With the helps of this people develop their inside statement. In this way people inprove their health.
However, there is a point of view that increasing the number of sports facilities would have little effect on public health. I think that it is particularly true, because a lot of sport exercises can have bad influence helth of people. If people have huge passiont to doing sport, then they can not remember about their health.
From my point of view, increasing the number of sports facilities improve public health. But I think that people must change attitude on doing sport. Instead of doing this with passion, people must choose time for doing sport exercises.
Despite on other people`s opinion. I still believe that sport is a big part of our life, which helps to enjoy our bodys and health.
