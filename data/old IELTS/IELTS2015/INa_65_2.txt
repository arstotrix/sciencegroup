Nowadays, the problem of improving health of population is very important for all countries. The scientists search for the best way of solving this problem and there are two points of view on the decision.
   On the one hand, there are a lot of people, who thinks what only sport and different physical activities can help us become more healthy. The sport gives us a lot of energy and positive, it can make us get out of bed easily. But there are people, who has different problems with heart, for example. And for them the big number of sports activities can be dangerous, that is why just rising of the amount sports facilities can not be the only way to solve this problem.
   On the other hand, some people say that sport does not give us a huge effect and does not improve our health. These people think, that must be others ways to become healthier. Maybe they mean, that we should spend more time the open air or eat only fresh and healthy good. But all these measures can not be useful without some physical activities or relaxation like yoga. This type of sport makes us more calm and makes out bodies and our minds clearly and healthier.
   In my opinion, there is no one particular way to make public health better. People are very different, every person has his own favourite activities and everyone should choose the way, depending on his lifestyle, interests, facilities. I think that people should do something, what they like and it will make them happier and healthier.
