There have always been government regimes which restricted the activity of creative classes. Nowadays there are a lot of debates in television programmes, in the internet and during different meetings on this topic. It is a very controversial question which is worth discussing. 
On the one hand, every person on the Earth is born with complete freedom in cases of choosing an opinion, a name, a place f living, an activity and in other directions which are supported by all democratic countries and United Nations organisations. So that is why artists always have to be given with full freedom to express their own opinion in any ways which are not restricted by laws of democratic countries. Besides, there have been many examples when works of really talented people banned, artists were put into jails. Therefore, many artists did not have an ability to show their talents to the world. 
From the other hand, the position of different totalitaric politicians and their regimes are clear. The works of different artists who have an opposite view on the policies which are led by government are very dangerous for rulers because these works of art have really big influence on masses. Consequently people in governments try to sent radical artist as far as possible because they are really scared of power of creative classes. 
The possible solution to this problem is the control of different organizations, such as UN on censure laws in rules between n totalic countries and other suspicious governmensts. 
In conclusion it may be said that the essentional democratic law of freedom of opinions, words, ideas must be supported in all governments and all cases.
