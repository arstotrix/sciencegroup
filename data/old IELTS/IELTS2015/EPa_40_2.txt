Through the last 50 years humanity grow up to 7 billion people. To continue this process people should keep their self in fit. That means that topic about public health is quite common. Some people thing that sport infrastructure can improve people`s health. Other told about other measures and think that sport have little effect on public healt.
Sport is the most common way to keep fit and stay healthy but sport is not so efficient as pharmacy, for instance. Hospitals and qualified doctors improve public healt much more that sport. Inventing peniciline and chemistry reseach gain more results than sport. To my mind, Pharmacy and free medicine can improve public health in better way than sports.
On the other hand, sport have come advantage. For example, sport look more natural than pharmacy. It also cheaper for nation and government than free medicine. And the most significand advantage of doing sport is that you prevent yourself from different illneses. At the same time, the main drowback of using pharmacy to improve your health is that you may damage one part of your common health when you heal anether part. 
In conclusion I want say that if people want to gain maximum level of public health they cant choose only sport on only medicine. The best way for humanity is to use theese things one with another. I mean that you should do some sport and time to time visit hospital on your own doctor if you want to become really healthy person.
