In the last decades were significant increasing in different technologies and this, of course, influnce on people`s health, so there are very actual problem now – how to improve and maintaine public health in nowadays conditions? Therefore, some people suggests that the increasing the number of sports facilities can help to solve this problem, but others convince that there are shoul be other measures. It is very controversial question, and I would like to express my point of view on the increasing of sports buildings.
First of all, people who believe in the power of sport are right in some extent. Sport can help and just to improve your skills and may be win some illness. But in my mind such people are wrong in some fact. In my point of view, we can do sports exercises not only in special sport facilities, but also at home or just run in parks, so, man`s health are often depends from himself. As was mentioned, other people suggests that sports facilities would have little effect on public health and there are should be other facts or motivations. As I think, such people right too, but not in all. Of course, other measures are necessary, for instance the healthy food, the conditions of living and so on, but I believe that sports buildings and in general, motivation to do sport will have quite significant influence on public health.
So, to sum up, I want to repeat that both views are right in some extent. In my opinion, sports facilities really can help tp improve public health and motivate people to do sports, but there are undoubtebly should exists other facts – mainly, man`s wants to be healthy.
