Nowadays, the sport is the important part of modern people's life. One people believe that the increasing the number of sport facilities is the best way to improve public health. Other people sure that it will be not effective for improve ealth of population. Whos point of view is right?


On the one hand, it known, tht sport activities make human strong and happy. Moreover, when person happy, he feels himself mach more better than other people. Then, when people has an everyday middle activity. They save and improve their health. Moreover, visiting the gym or other facilities is the contrast to spend time in the Internet. It has much more benefits for human. And last, but not least, sportsmen's eat only health food. And due to this reason their health level much more better then level of other people.


On the other hand, when human give the biggest part of his life to sport, in the old ages he has a lot of problems with health. Second part of people sure that the best way to improve public health is by developing health care service. Government should open more heath care organisation to solve problem of less level of public health.


In my opinion, the level of people's health can be increased by opening new sports facilities. I'm sure that only people who spend their time to sport activities can be health persons in our modern, indastry world.


To sum up, after analising both points of view, I agree with. The first part of population, but other people have good ideas how to improve public health by government helps.
