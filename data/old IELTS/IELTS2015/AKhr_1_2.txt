The vast majority of the democratic world and well-educated people believe that creative artists should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas (in words, pictures, music or films) in whichever way they wish and that there should be no government restrictions on way they do. In Russia this issue take a special place due to the popularity of traditionalism, orthodoxity and social dogmatism. Let's try to find out if there is some racional basement under such ideas and social politics. I would like to start from the statement that the whole world lives in the paradigma of liberalism in a way. Everyone want to have political rights, right for a free thinking and free expression but not all these people want to see or listen what others do and say (egoism is the one of the most popular negative characteristics). The idea do not have any color (white or black) untill it doesn't touch our freedoms. Thus, the contemporary art should not be forbiden, even if we don't understand it, and the nazi literature should be, because it tries to steal the freedoms of a group of people. And the second statement is pretty obvious as the first one: the world is transtendential. There is no objective truth what art is. How can we say that classical architecter has right to be used and the modern has not? It's all the question of the personal beliefs and biased wind. To sum up I want to say that there is invisible boarder between the freedom of expression and the other freedoms pf common people and the duty of government is to secure this boarder and save status-quo. Only the freedom of expression can give us a most detailed view of this complicated world, clear the cloads of ignorance and help to find the guidening star.
