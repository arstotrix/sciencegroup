The graph represents the percentage of men and women with different levels of qualifications which they held after school over one-year period. We can see a significant difference between genders mainly in figure "Skilled vocational diploma". Practically 90% of males prefered this type of qualification while only 10% of females did the same. It is also can be seen from the figure that approximately equal percentage of both men and women gained bachelor's degree. But the overall trend shows us that a significant number of men tried to improve the qualifications and got postgraduate diploma and master's degree. So, the percentage of such men achieve 70 and 60 percent. All in all we can notice some tendencies. Women prefere to hold the undergraduate diploma and bachelor's degree and then a lot of women are ready to stop and pay their attention not to education mostly but, as is could be considered, to their children and households. In contrast to this tendency a great number of men prefer to improve their special knowledge and qualifications.
