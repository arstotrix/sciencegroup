The current situation in the world with the great number of diseases and unhealthy lifestyle suggests that something should be changed. So, the idea of building sport centers and improving facilities showed up. That caused a lot of discussions in the society: while some people believed it was the best way to make people`s health better, others were not so sure about it. Thus, the question arises: should we increase the number of sports facilities in order to improve people`s health?
In my opinion, the answer to this question is definetely yes. First of all, people would get a better access to different fitness clubs and sport centers just because their number would be growing. It is known, that many of us are not so active only because there are not so many places to visit. Moreover, people would see by their own eyes how sport changes people. They certainly would like to take sport activities more if they have a close rote model living in the neighbourhood, not on the Internet or TV.
However, some people claim that increasing the number of facilities for fitness would not help. The first argument is that it is still quite expensive to visit a sport center, for example, and not so many people can afford it. The second argument is that the key factor of changing the situation with the public health is making good for them. More buildings are not the solution in this case.
To conclude, I would like to say that, despite all the counter arguments, I strongly believe that developing sport facilities would affect people`s health very much.
