In modern world gender equality became an important feature to discuss. Some people think that the amount of male and female should be equally proportional in every educational system like school and universities. However, there are several opinions that accepting the similar number of men and women in universities will lead to unification of all genders and problems in typically female or male professions.  I’m completely agree with the second one and think that not all woman can be perfectly studied as engeneers; constructors and other professins requiring physical and technical knowledges.  
First of all; God make us as different as he might do. Males are naturally more talented in Physics, Math and physically well done. Females have a stronger logics than men and perform perfect results in Arts. If we erase the edges of gender and will have to complete the university groups in equal way we will never achieve the highest output from each of typically gender jobs. 
Secondly, it is impossible to evaluate each number of places in universities according to fact that nathionwide   the amount of femenes exceed the number of males. We will never achieve equality according to the not clear number of students. 
Additionally, the equal number of students includes violence because of the possibility that man or woman would not want to complete the subject but have to according to proportional rules. 
In conclusion, specific view of proportion in university group can lead to catastrophe in human labour basics. Achievent the highest resultats are complicated process and equlity can ruin the process. If we accept the similar proportion we also agree to forget the desire students. Also woman had been nationally preserved from dangerous and physically complicated jobs. It’s urgent to not envolve the gender war in professional education unless we shouldn’t have became an without-gender creature.
