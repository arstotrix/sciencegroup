The diagrams illustrate the ages of people living in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and predict the situation until 2050.
   In 2000 about half of the population of Yemen were people from 15 to 59 years old. While in Italy there were more than 60% of these people. 
   It is predicted that until 2050 the proportion of people from 15 to 59 years old in Yemen will increase to 57.3%. And in Italy, opposite, the proportion of these people will decline to 46.2%.
   In 2000 in Yemen there were only 3.6% of people older than 60 years old. While in Italy there were about one-fourth of elderly people. It is predicted, to 2050 this proportion in Yemen will rise to 5.7%, while in Italy the proportion of elderly people will decrease dramatically to 42.3%.
   In 2000 in Yemen there were approximately a half of people from 0 to 14 years old. In Italy this proportion was about 14%. It is expected that until 2050 the proportion if this people will decrease sharply to 39% in Yemen while in Italy it will decline a little bit.
   To sum up, it is seen that the population in Italy is becoming older and in Yemen it is becoming yonger.
