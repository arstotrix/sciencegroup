Many people claim that artist should have absolute freedom is the way they create and express their understanding of the world and government shoukd be forbidden to influent this sphere. 
I partly agree with this statement. To my mind government can not restric art except two cases. The first one is provided by the typoes of art,  which are potentially dangerous for society, and the second one - by the pieces of art done unprofessionaly and witout any cultural function. 
The good example of both the confrontation and the partnership between art and government is street art. Every day a large number of graffities occur through the cities all over the world. Most of them are placed in publick spots or on the walls of houses and cover buses or trains, which is forbidden by city rules. On the on hand several pieces of street art are really fascinating and don'tbring any damage to city. But the rest of them, on the other hand, are awful and don't fit cultural norma, accepted in society. After years of war with all artists of this kind, the government of the most cities on Earth gave the special parts of city the most talented and wel-known street artists. According to my agreement to the statement in the beginning of the topic,  solutionlike this is perfect. 
Butat the same time artist should be raised to the basic laws of the human soiciety. Art that lead to people death should obviously be restricted by government. 
To sum up, the government can not have any impact on the art sphere exceptthe types of the art  damage soiciety or indiindividual humans. In other cases, a way of compromising should be founded.
