On the one hand, historically, there are a lot of examples when the government restrictons on the development. For example, Galileo. He had not freedom. So it always have negative effect on our scintice. It can be seen that the most important factors for the development in scintices, arts, musicsm e.t.c. it is allows creative people introduce their own ideas.
On the other hand, the freedom includes responsibilite. Therefore, it can be the reason why a government should control what anybody can told or show. In terms of creative artists it is also true. For example, children believe and trust TV, books, magazines. They can not analase an information that they get.
In addition, it is possble to create some schools and university, that will help creative artists explain people their idea without any dangerous for society. It can be seen that it helps to give apportinities for atticts and pay attention on safity.
To sum up, government should pay attention for everythink, especially for freedom. It is difficult to onderstand how any ideas can allows to children, to any cultures. Not every creative people think about sociaty. They only discovered some ideas.
