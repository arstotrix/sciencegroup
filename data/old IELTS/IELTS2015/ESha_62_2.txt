Healthy is the most significant part of modern humanity and, of course, there are a lot of various ways to make it stronger. Someone believe, that people can improve public health with the help of increasing of the number of sports facilities, while others think that this measure will not has any affect and people should find new ways.


Public health is an important part of society. If people will build more sport complexes, more stadiums and some sports grounds, more and more people will start doing sport. Children and teenagers will see, that adults spend their free time not in bars and at home, but in special parks with sport grounds and etc.  As a result, there are more and more people, who choose sport.


However, there is an other opinion on this aspect, some people say that other measures of improving public health are more effective. They notice, that a great amount of football or basketball grounds, sport parks and stadiums can not be a significant reason for people to change their lifestyle. They add, that increasing of spent lessons in schools and colleges or universities and re-equipment of this field of styduing may have more noticable effect. The main reason of this is that children and teens are needed to so sports.


As for me, I think that society should use not some single measure but complex one. First of all, government with the help of individual investments should build new facilities. It allows increase the amount of sport places for all who wants. Secondly, they should improve and develop sport system in education of children and teens. When they will have modern equipment, they will have a chance to start doing sport. Furthermore, some lectures about sport usefulness for health are also very important.


So, all in all, only with the help of complex of measures government and usual people can achieve an improving of public and personal health.
