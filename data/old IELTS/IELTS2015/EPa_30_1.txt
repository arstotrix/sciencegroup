The population of Yemen in 2000 was presented mostly by children aged up to 14 years, which were little more than a half of population (50,1%), and teenagers and middle-aged people. Projections for 2050 presents a decrease of the percentage of children and a little increase of an old people percentage.
Compared to Yemen, situation in Italy is very different: by the 2000 a biggest part of population consisted of people from 15 years old. The level of children percentage is much less than Yemen`s (only 14,3%) and it is expected to decline by 2050. The percentage of old people will increase up to more than a third past of population.
Both country tend to have less children, but more pensioners in the future, although the scopes have many differences.
