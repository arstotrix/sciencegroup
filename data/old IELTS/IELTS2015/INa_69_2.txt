There is no doubt that nowadays health is the most important thing for everyone. There are a lot of ideas how society can improve public health. Some people believe that this goal can be succeed by increasing the number of sport facilities. Nevertheless, other people say that this would not change public health because it influenced by another factors.
   On the one hand, good sports facilities may be cause of increasing interest in sport, especially for young children. If the schools and universities have a good quality of sport equipment more children would be motivate to visit lessons on physical culture. Besides, nowadays many people want to be fit. If they will have possibility to work with sports facilities, they will be pay more attention for it. What is more, it can help old people support their health by doing easy exercises with special equipment.
   On the other hand, most well-developed cities have a lot of different sport centres and it is not give a really good effect. People just not interested in it. So, if we have enough sports facilities and it is not help to improve public health, what is the point to increase it?
   To my mind, investing money to increase sports equipment is not effective measure. The most effective way to organize different social programmes and events to motivate people doing sport. Public health may be improve only when everyone understand importance of this and have interest to make it better.
