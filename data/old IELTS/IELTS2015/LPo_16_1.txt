The line-graph provides information about the percentage of 65 years old and more people in three countries: Japan, Sweden, USA from 1940 to 2040. In general, all trends are upward but they show different patterns in changing of proportions.
In terms of Sweden, it is noticeable that trend is quite erroting. It rises slightly from the beginning of the period (approximately 7%) reaching a peak of 25% at the end of the period. Likewise, quite similar pattern is demonstrated by the USA with just one minor difference. In 2011 the percentage of old people in Sweden comprised 20%, whereas in the USA that index accounted for about 14%.
By contrast, the model for Japan is a bit reversed. While trends for Sweden and the USA were going up in 1960, the proportion of old people in Japan was on the period of stagnation which continued to almost 1990. Nevertheless, this period is followed by a gradual increase to 2030 and then it will rocket to 27% in 2040.
