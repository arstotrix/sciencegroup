Art has always played a significant role in people's lives and has always been an integral part of the world. Art has a great impact on people that is why government should think if it is better to restrict creative artists or not. This is a complicated issue which has caused a lot of debate in society. Personally, I think, that government should not confine the freedom of creative artists. Firstly, with the help of their works polititian will be able to detect some social problems. This may happen due to the fact that all events and issues find their reflections in art. A free artist can depict the world without any danger, so governments can see the problems. Secondly, there is a financial consideration. If a country has a huge number of creative artists who are free, it will have more galleries, which will pay taxes. Thus, with the help of creative artists the government can fill the treasury which will lead to economic development. However, some people say, that government should constrain creative artists. They insist on the fact, that some forms of art can be offensive. For instance, there can be some pictures which rise nationalistic issues, which can lead not only to conflicts, but also to wars. That is why creative artists should not always be given the freedom to express their own ideas. I partly agree with this statement, but, to my mind, creative artists should not be limited. It is necessary to stress that nowadays people live in liberal, free and democratic world. So, these restrictions may contradict with democratic basic values. To sum up, there must be a reasonable balance, and art should be used with right intentions. It might be unfair to confine the freedomof creative artists to express their own ideas.
