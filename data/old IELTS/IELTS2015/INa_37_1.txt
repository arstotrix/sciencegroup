   The charts highlight information , regarding the percentages of age difference in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and the predictions on how the rate of people with different ages will have undergone a change in these countries by 2050.
Taking a closer look at the first chart, describing age difference in Yemen in the year of the second millenium, it is obvious that practically half of the total population was consisted of children up to age 14. It can be stated that a Yemen society proves to be yours. However, it is estimated that the proportion of minors (0-14 years) will have decreased to 37 % by 2050, when adults (15-59) are probably to take a lead in such a race. Slower but gradually the elderly population in Yemen is expected to rise up to 1,9 %.
   Let us make on to a population scheme in Italy. It is important to mention that in 2000 there were nearly 2,5 times more adults (15-59 years) than people of a retiring age (60+ years) and about 4,5 times more adults than children. In stark contrast to the year 2000, there is predicted to be a high rise in the quantity of retired people (42,3 %) in 2050. Teenagers below the age of 14, meanwhile, while comprise less than in 2000, with a decrease to 11,5 %.
   Overall, it is crucial to make relevant comparisons between Yemen and Italy. For instance, the Yemen population was young in 2000, whereas the Italians were significantly polled with adults to state a leadership. Moreover, Italy is likely to become a country of retired people, when, at the same time, Yemen is going to get more adults.
