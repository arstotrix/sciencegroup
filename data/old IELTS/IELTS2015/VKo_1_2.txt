Government take a big part of our lifes. We have a different cases of policy making, of regims and governence. How to government should give a freedom? Government should give a total freedom or restrict some points? Now (and in our history also) it is a very big problem to governemt and cityzens. It's better to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of total freedom for the creative artist for instance. Can they make work with sens of freedom? What can restrict their?
First of all discuss the opinion about restriction. In democracy we can't restrict anybody if they don't make a crime. In other political regims we can see that some artists can't work and move in other country or government make force to create according with some rools. The rools should maintain order but don't restrict people. In this case restriction have a positive hand. But government can restrict our body and our action in democracy. It is called biopolitics when government care about halfy and private life. In this way we could not notice that we are controlled. For instance government controll sexuality, smoking or alcoghol and refused to editors of film or books to use this topics.
However how to explaine to somebody about sexuality or  desease, for example, if we can use this themes? The new word in arts it totally revolution. Picasso for instanse or other postmodern afrtist attract us because their art do not restricted. They don't limit themself and many people love this art. Somebody could dislike or hate modern art but they havn't a rool to restrict other people, they can't limit right of others to admire another culture, another style.
At the end I want to say that no goverment or nobody else can not restrict the creative artists. But artists sould understand what they do and don't declain limits of society. All people should live in peace.
