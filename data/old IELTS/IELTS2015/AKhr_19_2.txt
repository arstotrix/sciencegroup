The question of creative class' freedom has become incredibly important in the modern world when ideas, if they become innovations, change life-style of several billions people. To begin with, pluralism as a pattern of relation to ideas dominates nowadays, at least in the developed countries such as United States and countries in Western Europe. This means that according to the democratic ideals, which consist pluralism, people should let creative class come up with new ideas. This attitude is supported by the statement that the more thoughts are told, the better it is. So this is about the absence of rights to forbid anyone show their ideas. What is more, new creative ideas can underline the truth hidden by some politicians and mass media, the truth about social, economic and political life. In the majority of cases art compositions of any kind have special messages inside. These messages may be extremely important to be told to concrete people in concrete time. Finally, the lack of freedom for artists is going to damage the common cultural background. Some really important events can be missed and never be illustrated in culture, while other nation's culture is able to use it as an advantage. To be able to survive, it is necessary to let the ideas be spreaded. On the other hand, such things as racism, nationalism and other descrimination that can ruin the whole society, can be shown only as the huge mistakes of a man's mind. Summing up all above, modern societies and a man himself need ideas produced by creative people. For governments to restrict these people means to weaken the culture and take everyone's right to develop into independent-thinking person away, that should be considered as a crime.
