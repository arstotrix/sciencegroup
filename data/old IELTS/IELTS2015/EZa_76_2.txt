Everybody knows that artists prefer to create in special atmosphere. So they constantly like music, poems, unussual films and nature. However, the government don't understand and don't support these talants. Some people agree with this opinion, but other people disagree. 
On the one hand a person must develop him or her natural talents and government must gradually support him. To begin with that they can opoen new, unic school where artists will rise these sucseses and develop not only knowledge about this subject, but also talents. Secondly, government must pay some sum of money, thanks this money artists will want to be better. So they must participate in different concerts. Finally, they can find name spesiualk for artists, for example "the best artist".
On the other hand government spend a lot of time and money due to organise some spesial school in the some sity, but children can study in this art school, if him or here parents have a lot of money. Moreover, government come to some consert the unical best artists, but it is not very important for him. Friends of artists must help him and support in talents and give money on development of this talent. 
To balance, people can say some problems which conect with athmosfer near artists, and discase about resons why tthis happened, but government must sold this problem by themself.
