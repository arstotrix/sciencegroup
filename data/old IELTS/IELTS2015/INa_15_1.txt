Task 1.
   The pie charts illustrate the information about ages of population in two countries in 2000 and predictions for 2050.
   Having looked at the first country which is Yemen, we see the information about people`s age. The least percentage is taken by children under 14 years and it remains almost the same with a few increase in 2050. The graph shows that 15-59-year people and people above 60 years divide amounts of percents almost equally and the situation changes in 2050 with more 15-59 year people.
  In comparison with Yemen, Italy has strongly different changes. People under 14 years are almost one seventh of all people in both times 2000 and 2050. 15-59 year people are 61.6 percent in 2000 and this number is presumed to fall by 46.2%. The 60+ years people in Italy are 24.1 percent in 2000 and they are predicted almost to double till 2050.
  Overall, the information in the charts shows slightly different numbers in the ages of population of Italy and Yemen. The stable member of 0-14 year people is always less then others in both countries. Meanwhile the 15-59 years are the biggest part of population in Italy and Yemen.
