This bar chart shows how much time UK people spent in different types of telephone calls between 1995 and 2002.
Overall, it can be seen that majority of telephone calls was provided by local-fixed line during the whole period. But after 1999 the total number of minutes of telephone calls by fixed line began to decrease. In contrast, number of minutes spent in other types of calls has rose steadily. We can see that number of mobile calls has increased well. It has 50 billions gap between 1995 and 2002 compared to only 20-25 billions gap of calls provided by local fixed line.
National and international line had about 60 billions minutes in 2002 and has increased by the third compared to 1995. Mobile phone calls had almost 45 billions and this is 20-25 times larger than in the start of the period, so itâ€™s clear that mobile phones now can be the main source of providing telephone calls.
