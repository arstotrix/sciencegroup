The diagrams illustrate the proportion of Yemen and Italy population and make predictions about possible changes up to 2050.
   To begin with, in 2000 the percentage of people of 0-14 and 14-59 ages living in Yemen were approximately the same. The proportion of an older people was rather small (3.6%). However, the situation are expected to change and the number of 15-59 aged people will increase from 46.3% to 57.3%. At the same time, the proportion of older generation will rise too on about 2.1%.
   More dramatically changes are predicted to exist in Italy. The number of 15-59 aged persons will decrease from 61.6% to 46.2% and proportion of 60 and more aged people will double in 2050.
   To sum up, the population in Italy is likely to get older and there is an evidence reduce of the number of young people. On the contrary, more and more people in Yemen will be born and less people die.
