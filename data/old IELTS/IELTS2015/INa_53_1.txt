Task 1.
   The pie charts illustrate data about ages of people lived in Yemen and Italy by 2000. It also provides information in terms of future, at 2050.
   In general, we can see a huge amount of people from 15 up to 59 years both in Yemen and Italy over five decades, 2000 â€“ 2050. The rate of young population is on the next place in Yemen. Meanwhile, in Italy percentage of people after 60-th are slightly more than percentage of young population.
   More detailed looking at the graphs reveal trend of increasing level of people from 15-59 years up to 2050, from approximately 46 % to 57 %. However, population of old aged people will be sharply increase in Italy from 24% to 42% by 2050. The index of young people in Yemen in 2050 is seven times higher than 60+ years people, at 37 % and about 6 % respectively.
   In conclusion, we can say that amount of people aged by 15-59 will be take the leader positions through the time. Nevertheless, population of old people will be increase both in Yemen and Italy.
