Nowadays in the modern world education have a huge role in our lifes. Thats why schools are very important in develop of children. Sometimes there are problems with students behaviour at school, what makes student’s education harder.

On the one hand there can be problems between teacher and his students. Sometimes, when teacher is not similar with all students one of them begin to discuss with teacher.

Confrontation between teacher and his student bring to difficulties between classmates. In my opinion, this problem must be solved by teacher. He must be correct and should find ways to each student in the class. First of all, teacher must be a good phsycologist. 

On the other hand there can be problems between male and female students. In the middle school this problem is the most important. Boys and girls learn to communicate with each other, often in the middle school students get their first love. Boy begin to be more insolant. In this situation school and parents should be together. They must teach them what behavior is right, because insolance also destroy a friendly atmosphere in the class and at school.

In conclusion, today at school are a lot of problems but I think, that the most important problem is relation between students. And Thats why student’s behavior play a big role. Schools must solve them in union with parents.
