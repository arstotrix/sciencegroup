Nowadays life has become much comfortable and safe. People now know how to manage with dangers of the nature. But the real threat for people is themselves. We have relaxed thinking that the world is doing everything by itself, we do not take care of anything and first of all of our health. People die not because of that scary diseases but just due to they are lazy. In this case some people say it is helpful to increase the number of sport facilities for improving public health. Others suppose it would not be effecient. Let us discuss both these views.
If we are saying that sport facilities will bring a good effect our reason can be the fact that people like to be used to something no matter what. My experience shows that people choose the most comfortable things. if a basketball stadium was closer to my home than a supermarket I would be addicted to sport rather than chocolate and it would be more healthy for me obviously.
On the other hand others could say that it is difficult to make people do anything unless they want it. So maybe there are other measures that goverment can do. For example, the healthy way of living can be promoted by social advertising so people will find the ways of improving their health by themselves. Furthermore, the money can be spent on medicine, new searchs and payment for doctors. Personally, for me it would be meaningful if there were the special prices for products which harm my health.
To sum up, both points of view can be. However, I think it would be better to take ideas from both of them because there are good reasons. As for me, the question of health is personal to every person.
