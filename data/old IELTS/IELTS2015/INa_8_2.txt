Writing Task 2.
   Some people argue, that many different sport opportunities will resolve a problem of public health. Others are not agree with them and have strongly belief that it will not help. In my point of view a lot of sport sections and equipments are very beneficial and without them no one could go in for sport.
   It goes without saying that every Olimpic champion reach his results in special place with some useful things, for example, it can be stadium, for runners or skipping-rope for gymnasts. It goes without saying that not every country has a river or a ocean to prepare swimmers, it essential to have a swimming-pool to do it.
   There is another meaning in the world that it is not necessary to have some extra materials to be health and fit. If someone want to look good he can take contrast shower or run in the parks.
   I think that governments should build sport centres and sport courts to give a chance for young people and adults to be strong and fit. Besides, it will inspire somebody to be a champion.
   To conclude, I want to say that it is not important what exactly you do to be health everybody should be fond of sport, but it not important what kind of sport it will be.
