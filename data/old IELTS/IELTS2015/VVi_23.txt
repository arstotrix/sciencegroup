I think, that ability to express own ideas in words, pictures or films by artist shouldnâ€™t be limited, but presentation this art to the audience can be abandoned sometimes, for example showing violence to the children.
But the other side of this question, is that sometimes goverment restict on the artists and their art too much just because of riot ideas, which cruel time, when artist can be send to the prison because goverment thought that his art has a bad influence on civiliants minds. Nowadays the same things happened sometimes, too. Recently I heard about art gallery with political pictures, which was closed in one day.
