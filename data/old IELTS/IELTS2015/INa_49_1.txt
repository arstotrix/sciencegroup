Writing task 1.
   The given graphs provide the information about the amount and aging of residents of Italy and Yemen in 2000 year and give predictions to 2050 year.
   Comparing Italy and Yemen in 2000 it can be seen that in Yemen the biggest part of population was children under 14 years, and in Italy this percentage is four times less. Though the amount of population from 15 to 59 years in both countries seemed to be the same – Yemen had 46,3 % of such people and Italy had 61,6 %.
   That concerns the predictions for Italy – there will be a tendency that the main part of population will be older. Really, 42% percent of people who are older 60 is extremely large for European country. Alternatively, Yemen will not face the same problem – the main part of the residents is predicted to be about 57 % and this part is the people aged 15-59. At the same time the amount of children, aging 0-14 is predicted to become two times less – only about 37 %.
   Summing up, it is necessary to say that the given charts can face two main tendencies: by the 2050 Yemen will have twice less children and the population of Italy is becoming older.
