Over the last decades, there was a huge argument about law restrictions for musicians, writers, painters and film-makers. Whilst some people struggled for it, others advocated against it. Let is discuss the main advantages and disadvantages phenomenon.


On the one hand, many people are confident that freedom of art is a necessary part of any modern government. First of all, it gives everyone an opportunity to express themselves as well as show the reality. Therefore, it can be inconvinient for some authorities. For example, in USSR there was a strong censorship at every stage including art, thereby those who didn't follow the rules were punished dramatically. This seems to be absolutely savage nowadays, although it still takes place in some countries. It is proven that censorship presence leads to a massive depression which is a bad sign for any government. In order to keep their position, they should provide freedom to the citizens, including artists. The other reason to support it is that any art debelops only with new ideas. It is dreadful to forbid artists to create, as the art can simply dissapear.


On the other hand, there is always a flip side. Many groups of people notice that modern art became meaningless and poor once it was given all freedom. They prefer to look back at past masters to satisfy their taste.


All things considered, the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. I am inclined to think that it is very important to have art freedom as it lets people express themselves and improves art.
