Writing task 2.
   In 21st century people began far more concerned about their health than ever before. Life level had been increased dramatically during the last century which caused the arise of a very important question: how does one can be healthier and live longer? There is common talk that the best way to improve public health is to increase the number of sports facilities. However, many people think that it is not the main measure and other solutions must be found and this is also my point of view.
   Firstly, to become more healthy people must eat healthier food. The rise of fast-food industry and artificial additions to what we eat caused many health issues. That is why people have to return to natural products.
   Moreover, in order to achieve good public health, people must be granted access to … and effective medicine, which a great amount of people do not have, it will cause almost instaneous effect.
   Finally, people have to improve an environment. Places of people’s inhabitant are polluted with industry omission which give very negative effect on people health.
   On the other hand a large amount of sport facilities will give people a better access to physical exercises which will help to improve public health.
   In conclusion, I would like to say that every sport facilities are good to maintain better health, they are not the main solution to the problem. Good public health is a very complicated issue and there must be found many measures to resolve it.
