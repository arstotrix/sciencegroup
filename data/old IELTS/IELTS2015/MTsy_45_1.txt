The charts depicts the data of the number of people involved in different age groups in 2000 compared to the prospective of the population in 2050 in Yemen and Italy.
If we have a look at current situations in Yemen we will clearly see that the majority of its citizens are under 15 years old. However, in the future the oldest generations will prevail and rich almost 60 percents. In Italy there is a big percentage of people who are 15-59 years. It is expected to have a growth in the number of people over 60 years in a half of the century. Surprisingly this age group will almost double the current size. In comparising of two aforementioned countries we can definitely see that 2000 Yemen's citizens were younger than Italians, as the persentage of people who are sixty and more is less than 5 % whether in Italy they form almost a quarter of the whole population.
