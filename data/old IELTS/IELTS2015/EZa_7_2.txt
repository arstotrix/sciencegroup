Everyone is searching for happiness. Being happy is a life goal. People are searching for a good job, nice and tidy appartment and  love of their life to be happy. Because if you don’t like your surrounding, you’re not going to be happy.
As we know, everyone describes happiness in different ways. For some people having a dicent job and lots of money on their bank account is a way to be happy. From the other hand, lots of people do not pay attention to material things and find their happiness in love. That’s why every person has his own priorities and search for happiness following them. This is the reason why it’s hard to describe happiness – almost everyone will have his own answer. But it doesn’t mean that some of them will be wrong or right it means that, for example, my definition of happiness might not suit to my friend because he can probably  be wishing for a lot of friends for being happy, while I think that good health is most important in our life.
In my opinion, the most important factor in achieving happiness is being sure that you don’t harm anyone around you. I think unexeptable to follow your dreams walking by other people’s heads. Someone’s unhappiness can’t make you happy and your life complete. It shouldn’t has bad consequences for people around you.
To sum up, even if it’s hard to define what happiness is, people have to think before doing anything to reach their dream. Because we can’t be happy by making someone unhappy. Think about people around you is a first step on your way to be happy.
