Nowadays there is a common opinion that there shall be a full freedom for creative artists in order to meke them able to create whatever they want. 
On the one hand while our society is arming for democratical ideals it is strictly needed among the creative class to fightt for freedom and human rights to protect and express their freedom. Also, it is believed that regular man has no right to judge genious and just can't decide is one genious or not. 
On the other hand, either deed or creation mustn't harm the future of the man hold in any way. That means that no one is allowed to have a bad influence on the children minds, while they are so easy to be affected. Moreover, there shoulkd be some moral principles are laying beneath the law system. Surely, they tend to be changed as the time goes by and the progress is in the movement, but it can happen only after deep researches in order to protect the feature.  
It is obvious that there can be a compromise been found. Those creative artists can be allowed to fullfill their need of creation in an every possible way. But this allowance shall have some restrictions and limits, there is no deed worth enough to break the basic human right, also the most unagreable works shall be protected in order to do no harm, as  it was mentionned in the paragraph above and they surely should be saved to detour children decide weather those things were producedproduced by geniouses or not.
To sum up, neither most conservative nor most modern way of deakling with the problem is not acceptable. The ability to find compromise is the thing that makes us different from savages.
