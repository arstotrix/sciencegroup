Task 2
   Public health and it improvment important idea for many countries. But methods of it improwment differ greatly.
   There are two view on increasing number of sports facilities as the method of impovment. Nowadays many people looking for GYM or swimming pool to keep fit and pay money for that. But if government build sports facilities which are easily found and control it condition that can provide great convenience to other people which not ready to spent great sums of money for doing sport.
   The oposite opinion is that the use of sport facilities is restricted by the time, seasons , and location. Therefore, such sports facilities won`t be suitable for all citizens, especially to workers with workday from 8 a. m till 7 p. m.
   Improving public health requires a combined effort , not just single action. Government can only conduct promotion of healthy lifestyle , all the rest is the private matter of citizens. Of course we must build new sports facilities for young generations and providing them pocibilities to impove their health.
