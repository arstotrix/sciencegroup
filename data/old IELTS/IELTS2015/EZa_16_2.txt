What is happiness? And what way people can choose to achieve it? These philosophycal questions I meet and will try to answer in my essay.
I believe that life is a long cross for reaching happiness, for feeling good. Creating families, making money, everyday working etc. just a tryings of scoop up the fortune. The problem for plenty of people is that they can’t understand, what they really need to do to enjoy their life and waste a lot of time doing things they really hate. The main reason of it is that we live in the world when everybody try to trust us on their own opinion about what we need to be happy. Friends, parents, business-companies, mass media can only muddle the person, but will never give the map of the way of reaching harmony.
But really important is understand who you are and what you want to do. Earning money going to work, everyday  routine can make feel a person depress, pushing down. It’s obvious that the happiness can’t be something like this.
In conclusion I would like to say, that the positive way of thinking, understanding, who is person themselve and what he or she really want to do, really enjoy and doing it is the key to the doors of happiness.
