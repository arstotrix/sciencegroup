Some people think that those who have a creative job should not be restricted by anyone in their work. The reason is that the freedom borns new ideas and ways ofexpression them. 
There is no doubt that freedom helps thoughts to fly. But I do not think  that this freedom should not be restricted, because everything has nits own limits. Iv the artist feels free, it doese not mean that there qare no things and actions that are prohibited. Moreover, such thoughts may be dangerous as for a person, who shares this idea, as for people around him or her. For example, there is one russian actor, who has already showed distructive behaviour. He also has injured some people. Giving people an action freedom is too dangerous for society. It is also kniwn that some artists begin to take drugs hen they have a crisis. Who can predict whatnwill happen around them while they being affected? Nobody knows. 
From my point of view, being restricted by somebody or something is the way of becoming better as an artist. If you can create something while being in an empty room, you are a genius. It does not matter who restricts you, but if you can bring your masterpiece to the diamond despite all the difficulties it means you wil improve your skills during the whole life. 
Creating something is a difficult way to understand who you are and what you can do. Feeling free helps to identify your personality but we should not forget that sometimes it can be very dangerous foir thise who surround us. Do not avoid restrictins that is the key to success.
