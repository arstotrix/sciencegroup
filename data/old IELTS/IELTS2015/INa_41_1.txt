Writing task 1.
   The pie charts provide information about the changes in different ageing sectors of populations in Yemen and Italy during the period from 2000 and 2050.
   In general, the changes of population in these countries are completely different. First of all, a number of children who are from 0 to 14 years old accounted for a half of population in Yemen in 2000. But it is projected to decrease sharply to just over a third (37 %) in 2050. On the other hand, the category of people who are from 15 to 59 increase to a anticipated high percentage of population in 2050, with 57,3 %. When in the beginning of century it is just 46,3 %. 60-plus group remain almost stable, rising slightly from 3,6 % to 5,7 % over the same period.
   In contrast, there are opposite changes in Italy, where the most numerous group is aged (60+ years) in 2000, but in 2050 there is a dramatic increase from 24,1 % to 42,3 %. Moreover, people ageing from 15-59 are predicted to decline from nearly two thirds to only 46,2 % over the same period.
   Overall, the charts show the two different models of population in two completely diverse countries.
