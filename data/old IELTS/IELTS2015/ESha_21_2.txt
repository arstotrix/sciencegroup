Nowadays, creative artists can express their own ideas to people, but some of them are depend of the government. This essay will show, why some artists can express their ideas and why some of them can't do it.


There are a lot of famous artists, who have there own ideas and they can say about them. I think that it's depends of how popular are these artists and how much people agree with their ideas. Such artists are not depends of the governments and can express their ideas free. On the other hand, artists' ideas can be strange and dangerous and can have a bad effect on the society. So such ideas have to be some control from the government.


At the same time, there are a lot of artists, which are not very famous, or maybe their are a part of culture project of the governmet, so they depends of the government and they can't speak free about their ideas. For example, I know some singers in my city, who are not very popular, so they need a help from the government, such a some commercial concerts, where a lot of people could know about them and it can help them to be more famous and popular. In this situation they can't express their own ideas which are different from the ideas of the government.


In conclusion, there are a lot of reasons why some artists couldn't express there ideas. I think, that every artist is a part of culture, so he has a right to free express their own ideas throught the words, pictures, music or films which become a part of the culture which can help people are change their point of view about life.
