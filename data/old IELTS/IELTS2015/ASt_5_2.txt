Nowadays there are many various rules, which are established in universities for getting more use from modern education in developing countries and the number of students with various subject in the university are for higher but the major factor is equal demand in the field of different subjects. It is rather difficult to divide the amount of students in equal proportions.  However, personally I believe  that both male and female should  be entitled to access in every subject rather than being an equal number of genders in every subject.|
	From my point of view, true universities are now full of crowded  people in order for the need of their preferable subject which they want to study . Moreover, most of the students often prefer most demanding subject. In that case, administration asseses the quality of students, which is good judgement in order to empower equally both male and female. Female or male will be selected by the unfoir  judgement and maybe will not be succeed.   
	But there is another point of view. Some people think that there are a number  of subjects which are always dominated by the females , as art and design course for example. In the administration wants to fill  up these gaps by the males but remains vacancy at the last. Different subjects have sundray demand according to the gender allocation. But every student gets provided the same opportunities.
	In conclusion, I would like to stress out that student should choose the subject according his own interests and features.
