The same number of men and women should enter to Universities in all subject.
I can't agree with this statement, which sounds like discrimination. I have three reasons to disagree with this topic. 
Firstly, it is not real to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject because, there are many profession only for man and only for women. For example, if you are women you will not be a programist or driver in subway. If you are men, you never be stylist, model.
Secondly, in our country, the proportion of male and female student are very different. The University can't predict how many women and men want to enter to High School in this years. 
Thirdly, it's not good to make a new problem for student who want to study in subject which interested him.
I think that maybe Universities should accept equal number of students in every subject. It is must not depend on who is student: man or woman.
