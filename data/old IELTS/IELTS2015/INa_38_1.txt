Writing task 1.
   From the charts below we can get information about populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and future 2050 year. This task can help to knew about level of life in this country.
   First of all, we can see that population of children (0-14 years) has really huge. In Yemen – 50,1 % of all population. It’s children from 0 to 14 years. In Italy this figure is 14,3 %. But in Italy old people (60+ years) contain 24,1 % and only 3,6 % in Yemen. Of course, the largest part of population is young people from 15 to 59 years. In Italy this figure is 46,3 %. This situation will change in 2050 by researching. The quality of life will rise in Yemen. The figure of people 60+ years will be over 5,7 %. The quality of life in Italy will rise too. But it can lead to the serious problem with demografy. Only 11,5 % of children.
   In conclusion, I can say, that this charts can help to model future but it is really difficult to change situation.
