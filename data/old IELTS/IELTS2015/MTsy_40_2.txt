Nowadays, people discuss the problem of people's health. There are two different points of view how improve public health, one group think that increasing the number of sports facilities will help; another group does not agree this this idea. I think that first group is right and the increasing the quantity of sports facilities will have a positive result.
First of all, now different sports like tennis, swimming, football, are very popular. Different company can use this tendency to attract people and show them, that sports can improve their helth. Secondly, many sports facilities is more cheper than something else. For instance, children go to the swimming pool with school, many boys and girls can play football, basketball in the special area, which can be cheap if built it for the many people, but not one school.
The increasing of sports facilities is not the only way to improve public health. Government use different marketing strategi to decrease the quantity of smoking people and people, who drink alchocol. However, it is not very effective, because people need something another to forgot about sigarrets, drugs and alchocol, and in this time of our live we do not have idea how decide this problem. Moreover, people have not a free time to do something that take much time, then sport we can do at home.
To summurise, I can stead, that the increasing the number of sports facilities can improve public healt. In my opinion, this is the best way, because this way is more cheape and now people like sport, sport is in fashion.
