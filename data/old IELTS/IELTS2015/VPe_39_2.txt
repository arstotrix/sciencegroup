Today there are some specializations in universities, where usually study only men or only women for example: in the University of Federal Department of Safety girls can be accepted only on the Translated Faculty and they have no chance to attend another faculty. In my opinion this extend is not true.
Nowadays, there are different things in which people might be interested and it is not right to divide specializations for men and women. From a previous period of life was saved a believe from people that male get better possition then women. So, we can see it today: most companies holders are men and women usually do work like housekeepers. Some universities like university of Federal Safety block female to get specializations like layer. More than that, girls never would be a pilot, on this specialization universities don't accept them. It can be seen very rarely a women as a bus driver. Especially, on military specializations vacancies for women are not popular. There are several more examples, where only men can be accepted in medicine as an example. But on these specializations there are a lot of female, who want to do so, but can not.
To make a long start, I reckon that universities should give a chance the same number of women as they give for men.
