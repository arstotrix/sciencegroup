The horizontal bar chart and pie chart below demonstrate how the demand of electricity is dependent on a season and what electricity is typically used for.
As an overview, the typical daily demand for electricity in winter is the leader of the graph. There were two times as much units of electricity used in winter as units of electricity used in summer (from 15000 points in summer to 40000 points in winter). Obviously, the most electricity is used for heating rooms and heating water (about 50%). That is why, the demand for electricity in winter is much higher.
A more detailed look at the graph reveals that people used electricity for ovens, kettles and washing machines â€“ almost 20%. The percentage of lightning, TV and radio users and the users of vacuum cleaners, food mixers, electric tools is the same (15%).
What is more, the demand of electricity reachs the peak at 11 PM in winter and in 2 PM in summer. So that people use all these electric tools more than ususal. The lowest point and the lowest demand for electricity is at 9 AM.
Clearly, there were similar trends of the demand of electricity In England during summer and winter days. The demand of electricity in winter is much higher then in summer because of the necessity of heating rooms and heating water in winter.
