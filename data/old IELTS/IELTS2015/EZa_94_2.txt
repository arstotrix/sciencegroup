The problem of freedom is an important issue nowadays. There are various opinions on this question. This problem is worth discussing. 
Some people believe that creative people should be given as much freedom as they need.
Firstly, freedom provides opportunities to imagine things in any way, thus unusual, unbelievable music, pictures are created. Secondly, when something or somebody bother people creating something new it influences on their imagination and thoughts. They begin to forget important things that they have wanted to include in their works. Finally, creative people can even become nervous, angry and irritating when something goes wrong.
On the other hand, some people argue that freedom must be reduced by government. First of all, sometimes creativity puts I a wrong way. For example, graffity often is drawn on walls where it does not allow. Moreover, films which are launched should not contain censure scenes. It must be checked by government and people who are responsible for this film. Last but not least, the government should pay more attention to social networks, where a lot of unallowed things are existed.
To put it in other words, government should control creative artists, in some cases to punish them or give taxes.
To sum up, creative artists should be given freedom, but it should be controlled by government.
