Nowadays, in a modern world people should know more than one language. Therefore, there is a trend to teach children foreign languages as sooner as possible. However, does it do more good than bad? In this essay it will be tried to discussed.
  First of all, knowing of foreign language is absolutely necessary nowadays. Sooner you will start to learn is better, because in childhood the memory is more flexible and more accomodative to foreign languages. So, it will be possible to learn and know more different languages and to be cosmopolitan. 
  However, in the early childhood, children are not very determined to learn. Given by the statistics in elementary school in Russian Federation in 2010, there are no significant success in learning foreign languages. The opposite situation is with elder schoolers, who show positive results in language education. Let’s don’t make too much pressure in little children. The learning of languages should be enjoyable.
  To crown it all, considering to opinions, learning language in the early childhood is rather fruitless.  So there would be much more profits for young people, when they start learning foreign languages in secondary school understanding what they are doing.
  As a result, nowadays is absolutely necessary to know foreign languages. It is valuable in education, business, tourist spheres. Hence, very young children usually have not significant success in learning foreign languages. So, there would be much more advantages, in my opinion, when children start learning foreign languages when they are a little mature and understand profits of learning foreign languages. Even so, so many men, so many minds.
