Nowadays some people are sure that in universities should be equal number of women and men in every subject. I am not fully agree with this statement.
On the one hand, it can be a good idea to accept the similar number of male and female in one subject because it can be interesting for people to comunicate with each other. Moreover, these people can miss more lessons because when girls, for example, will have attention from boys, they will want to go to university more (this situation can happen with men too). In addition, a lot of people are single from philology faculty ir mathematic faculty, because they are always busy with their study in order to find a boyfriend or a girlfriend outside from ther university, but if there is the similar quantity of male and female on the one faculty or even on the one subject, these people can have a private life.
On the other hand, it can be really hard or even impossible for universities to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. For example, not a lot of man want to be a philologist, and there are a lot of girls at these types in this direction and only a few men. The same situation is with mathematics faculty (but here there is a lot of men) and university can’t obligate people to study on the faculty, where they won’t want to study.
To sum up, it can be said, that the idea to accept the similar quantity of  man and woman in every subject is good, but it is very hard to make it real.
