Task 2.
   Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others, however say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required.
   It is common knowledge that health of our society should be improved. Some people believe that more widespread sport facilities can solve this problem, whereas others disagree suggesting other appropriate because the more measures are taken, the greater effect can be caused.
   Generally, those believe that the best way to improve public health is to increase the number of sport facilities are definitely right. For instance, it was proved by doctors that sport has a great positive effect on health. Therefore, the more gyms, sport clubs and other sport facilities are available, the more people could work out and, as a result, the society in general will be more healthy.
   Nevertheless, some people have another point of view to this problem as they do not find sport facilities really effective. Some of them suggest free and available medical service, others offer to forbid selling alcohol and cigarettes in supermarkets. 
In addition, they say that advertising is really important. I do believe that this is the most effective measure. For instance, people everyday surf in the internet, watch TV, listen to radio and see printed advertisments. So, healthy lifestyle including healthy food, sport exercises, doctors’ recommendations should be widely advertised.
   All things considered, there are different opinions on the problem “how to improve public health”. I support all appropriate measures that people, especially scientists and doctors, suggest because it is the most effective and the fastest way to improve health of the society. I am absolutely sure that the combining of different measures can lead our society to a healthy life.
