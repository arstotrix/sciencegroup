Creative people should have freedom off expressing their own ideas in a way they can express (in words, photography, fiming, painting.) Governmen should not try to controle this spear totally as in this way creative people will lose the chance to create. 
First of all, it is important to understand that all we different abd bariers are not good to everyone. For creative people it is important to feel freedom, to have money for food and so on. As Van Gog sad: painter shouldt be hungry. Secondly, when government give such freedom and abbilities to people it also will have profit from it. Such cities as Florence, Rome, London, Newyork are popular for its architecture and art museums. Florence make money on things that was done in 16 thentury till now! So it will give an apartunity for such people to create and design we will make things around us better. 
From the other side, sometimes such bariers becomes a reason of art. Widly known writer Bulgakov wrote most of his great things hating the country he live in. But for me this argument is week to make the rules strict. 
All in all, government should understand that the importance of art and design for good and high-level living in modern world that everything that suround us influense on everyone. Moreover beuty around which creative people can make can make our lives better.
