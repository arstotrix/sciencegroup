Public health is the issue that frequently generates a great deal of public debate, with supporters maintaining the view that it is vital to increase the number of sports facilities and sceptics,who suggest that such solution, will have no results. As far I'am concerned, the governments should provide more opportunities for people to do sports as it is of the best solution in order to deal with the problem of decreasing public health.


In the first place, various kinds of sport centers for people of every age likely to improve the access of population to sport classes. As a matter of fact, if there are lots of different centers near the residential areas, people will receive an opportunity to visit them frequently and will take sports courses, which they like. As a result, such solution will help to increase people's interest in sports activities and improve public health.


Another point in favour of increasing the quantity of sports facilities would be the fact, that people will have an access to sports activities, which do not recieve any payments. In fact, there are many situations in which person do not have enough money to pay for courses in special centers. However, if there are special areas with cheap equipment, it will increase the number of people who do sports and will certainly have positive effect on their condition such sports activities will help them to keep fit and healthy.


However, some people argue that it is more useful to rise the sums of money, which are given to the hospitals or scientific researches as it will help to find new ways in order to fight with different deseases and to decrease the number of people's illnesses.


Taking everything into consideration, government should provides not only new sports facilities, but also takes other measures, such as to increase the sums of money for scientific researches and medical equipment. Both measures will help to improve public health and combat with other problems, connected with this issue.
