Task 1.
   The pie charts shows us the ages of people in Italy and Yemen.
   First of all, in the year 2000 the majority of the population in Yemen was teenagers and kids in the age from 0 to 14, while in Italy most people are adults, whose age is 15-59 years. I should notice that the number of youngsters and the number of adults in Yemen is almost the same. Secondly, in Italy the percentage of people, who are more than 60 years is big. It’s about 24%, while in Yemen the percentage of olders is it’s only 36%.
   In the nearest 50 years the situations will not change absolutely. In Yemen the number of adults will gown up a few and will be about 57%. The number of youngsters will fall down 37%. While the percentage of olders will be practically the same – 5%. As for Italy, the number of olders will increase rapidly to 42%. It may be connected with low level of new borners. And the level of youngsters in Italy also will be the same like in Yemen.
