The main message of the chart is the differences in getting post-school qualifications, according to the gender in Australia in 1999. From the chart it's clear that men were more likely to hold skilled vocational diploma, postgraduate diploma and master's degree. In contrast to males, females were not used to getting skilled vocational diploma, they amounted just about 13%, however the level of women involved in holding undergraduate diploma doubled the men's one and reached the point of 70%. The chart also illustrates that both females and males tended to choose bachelor's degree equally, because the proportion of them is almost the same. Postgraduate diploma was prefered by males, but the quantity of females was substantial enough and counted about 30% comparing to men's level. Finally, master's degree in Australia in 1999 was held not only by men, as the proportion of females counted about 40%. So, the most popular qualification among women was undergraduate diploma and the males' one was skilled vocational diploma.
