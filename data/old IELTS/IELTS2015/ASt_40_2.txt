I think that the major influence on our personality has thouse characteristics with which we are born, than any others.
If, for example: a boy which was born on harm with strong desire to become scientist , or an astronaut he would do everything for his dream and eventually his dream will come true.
But if that boy doesn't have that stong desire gerd his family would not support him in his ideas and dreams he would not realize his dreams. So the result depends not only from thouse characteristics with wich person was born but also from the further experience. One of the best example of stong desire is biography of sir F. Peaks, the brave sailor who start from the very bottom and ended his cascer whoen the flag of British crown. Or the well grown Russian scientist lomonosov with his great story about.
