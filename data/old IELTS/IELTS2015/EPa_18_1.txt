These charts illustrate the percentages of people`s age living in Yemen and Italy. There are three gaps of years: from born to 14, from 15 to 59 and 60 and above. In 2000 Yemen was the country with huge amounts of young people which are predictable to reduce to the 2050 almost on 13 per cent. At the same time in 2000 numbers of people under 14 in Italy was only 14,3% while the biggest share contains people from 15 to 59 ages. Projections for 2050 shows that amounts of elder people will raise and percentage of people under 59 will reduce. In 2000 Yemen`s young people were at least in three times bigger in amount than Italy`s ones are remain so in 2050. The percentage of 15-59 years in 2050 in Italy are supposed to equal the ones in 2000 in Yemen while Yemen`s percentage of 15-59 years people in 2050 will likety  to be closer to percentage of the same category that was in Italy in 2000. To sum up all above Yemen is probably becoming more full of people of medium age and Italy is likely to have less young pepole and more older people.
