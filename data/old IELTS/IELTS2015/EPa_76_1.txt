The four pie charts are describing the percentage of people of different ages in Yemen and Italy. The pie charts on the left are providing the information about the situation in the year 2000 and those on the right are giving a predictions for the year 2050.
Considering the situation in Yemen it is clear that the population will become older by 2050, as the percentage of young people (0-14) will drop from 50,1% in 2000 to 37%; moreover, the number of people, who are 60 and older, will encrease by 2,1%. 
If we look at the pie charts, that are defining the situation in Italy, we will see that the trend is practically the same, but the change will be more dramatic. Nearly the half of the population (42,3%) in 2050 will be those who are older than 60, while the per cent of young people, who are from 15 to 59 years old, will decline from 61,6% to 46,2%.
