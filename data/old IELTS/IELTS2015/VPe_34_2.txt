In the modern life, where the knowledge of people is the most important thing, that provides opportunities to choose a well-paid and interesting job, such thing as university but a great impact. Some people believe, that it is really nesessary to accept equal proportions of male and female,according to every subject , while others don t see any point in it. Personally, I am agree to the former so I will give some arguments according to my position. 
What should be mentioned at first, is that now is the 21 centuary,where the rights of man and woman are equal. It means that it shouldn't be so sitious? for woman for example to choose only humanitarium proffessions , like teaching. I know a lot of girls, who whant to work in sphere of technologies, like computers or even in nano industry. According to this fact, universities should provide studying opportunities for women as same as for men. 
However, sometimes male are also do not have rights for difficult kinds of proffessions. If we speak about Russia, for example, it is really rare thing to see a man taking a role of nurse or teacher in both school and kindergarden. Scientists made a lot of reaseorchers , that mentional much profitable work stratagies with children of men, either woman. So the universities should also take this fact in consideration. 
Comparing with my suggestions some people could say that my position is not right. And the gender rights are not that should be speakan about. Some people still stay in the road of corservatism and socialism, because of it, they do not want to change their view on the situation. 
Coming to an end, it will be likely to say that everyone has his own opinion, and it could not be the same as mine. But I am sure, that the rights of bouth gender should be taken in consideration, likewise in the education programms of Universities.
