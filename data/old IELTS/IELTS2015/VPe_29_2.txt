Some people think that the same amount of men and women should graduate university. Even through it's a good way to ?snow?, especially in a democratic country, that men and women have the same rights, I don't think that it would be a good idea to accept both on the some subject.
First of all, every university has its own specialty: technical or humanitarian. It's known, that boys in its majority have the abitities to understand technical sciences, while girls are good at literature, languages and other humanitarian sciences. If government will separate students and violate their right to choose their own profession. The world will see bad musicians with great abilities to cook well, awful doctors without opportunities to become a painter as he wished in a childhood.
Secondly, such a totalitarian separation will not give any chance to student to graduate to another subject if there is a certain number of people. Such a group would be really hard to sort just because to the the gender issue of each city. It means that the number of students can be decreased or increased for a long period of time until the amount of male and female becomes equal. 
All in all, I think that it's not an appropriate idea to let the equal number of men and women graduate University. Students should have the right to choose subject not by the number, but by their interest. When government make such restrictions, it chooses the totalitarian way to control people activity. And I think it's wrong.
