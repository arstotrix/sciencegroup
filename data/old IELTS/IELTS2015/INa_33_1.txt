Writing Task 1.
   The charts provide data on the percentage of three math age groups ( youth, average and elderly) in Yemen and Italy concerning situation in 2000 and future predictions.
   Overall, in 2000 Yemen tends to have a half of the population in people under 14 years old (children and teens) and less than 1/25 of population are eldery people. In contrast, in Italy the percentage of eldery is eight times bigger as in Yemen with approximately 24 %. Also the percentage of young people in this country is about one forth of Yemenâ€™s youth percentage.
   Having a look at the predictions for 2050 year, we can see that the percentage of average (15-59 year) people tend to serghtly increase in Yemen and decrease in Italy. The difference youth people in two countries declines a bit with one fourth to one thirds in 2000 and 2050 correspondigly. There is also a dramatic grouth in percentage of eldery people in Italy, in 2 times size, in fact.
To sum up, there should be stated that the data in the charts shows the trend for Italy to have a half of population as eldery people and for Yemen to have more average-aged people.
