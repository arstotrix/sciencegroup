It is a common knowledge that education system in some countries face many severe problems. One of such problems is an unappropriate student behavior, which may be caused by many things.

If we talked about developed countries the main reason for such behaviour seems to be that young people think that money is the only important thing in the world, but do not believe that education will give them desired money and because of that do not believe in itsâ€™ importance. For developing societies the main reason is as well as not enough good condition of life; awful condition of education system. First of all, school buildings (if existed) are usually old and dirty. Second of all, teachers who work there usually do not even have a higher education. Since they do not know how to work with the audience, classes can not be interesting. Third of all, parents of these kids are usually ueducated themselves, because of that they can not represent themselves a good example to children. Because of all of these reasons student bad behaviour problem is so severe.

From my own personal experience I may say that the more active and educated teacher is the better discipline is existed in the classroom. For developing countries roots of education problem exist in economical problems of the country. But for the developed countries it seems that the problem is in the system itself. Education system should be rearrange: now way of teaching should be developed, classes should be more interesting and students should start to think by themselves instead of memorizing information.

There are many things should be done to defeat problem of bad behaviour, but if students have interested in education such problem would never exist.
