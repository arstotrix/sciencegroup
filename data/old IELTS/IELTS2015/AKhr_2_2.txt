Nowadays it is imposible to imagine our live without creative ideas around us. However, sometimes this creative solutions can show our perception of the world. First of all a lot of people decribe the meaning of the word "creative" as the freedom to realize ideas. Despite this fact there is a lot of creative people who work in the advertising field, and we also can call whem creative artists. The advertisement it is a public sphere, and if there is not any governemental check or rules, advertising can be cruel and unetichal. There is a lot of advertising compaunes that can illustrate this example. Another point is that artist want to show the piece of art in the different gallery and exebitions. And sometimes this works not adopt for little children. That is why I belive that public art should be under government restriction, in this case we can controle the etichal, and moral health of the people. But exist another point of view, that art give you an apportunity to express your perception of the world and it is must be compolsory free from government rules and restrictions. I'am partly agree to this opinion. However there is significat issue, that those art isnot for all type of audience: free art could be acceptebal for your frends or people wich same creative perception, but not for little children or grand parents. To sum up I want to underline that art is a way to express emotions, but some times creative artists can forget about deelings of others people and make them feel uncomfortable. That is why I totaly agree that public art must be controled by the government.
