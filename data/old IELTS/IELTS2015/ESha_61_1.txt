The pie charts illustrate the amount of people of each age group in Yemen and in Italy in 2000 year and predicted amounts of populations in 2050 year.


Firstly, it can be seen from the graph that the population in Yemen consists of youth for a half while in Italy, the persantage of youth is only 14,3%. Then in Italy there is a biggest category of people who aged from 15 to 59 years (about 61%) and one fourth part is an age category including old people (60+ years). Having compared with Yemen the amount of age group from 15-59 years is 46,3% and old people have only 3,6%.


The situation in 2050 will change in both countries as it is shown. The young auditory of the countries will contracts by 13% in Yemen and by 3% in Italy. The middle-aged part of people will rise in Yemen up to 57% whereas the same category in Italy will go down to 46,2%. The oldest part increases in both countries on 2% and on 18% respectively.


The main tendency is the change in proportions and undoubtedly children's auditory will decrease however the change in middle-aged part of population is various in Yemen and in Italy.
