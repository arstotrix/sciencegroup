The graph illustrates 3 lines related to the population aged 65 and over in 3 countries: Japan, Sweden, the USA in the period between 1940 and 2040. The Y axis indicates the percentage of this kind of people while the X axis shows particular years.
The first thing to note is that in the period from 1940 to the early 1990s lines responsible for population in America and Sweden followed the similar pattern. Then the number of Swedish citizens of this age category is expected to experience a sudden rise from approximately 14% to 20%, afterwards there may be a slight fall, but in mid 2020s figures probably go up again. They’ll continue to grow during the rest part of the period. In America the number of people aged 65 and over remained stable from early 1990s to late 2010. After that, it’s expected that it will increase.
What’s about Japan, firstly figures declined slowly, but in 1960 they leveled out and stayed untill late 1980s, then they start to rise, especially the growth is expected to be substantial in early 2030s.
Thus, it can be said that the overall trend for all 3 countries is upward.
