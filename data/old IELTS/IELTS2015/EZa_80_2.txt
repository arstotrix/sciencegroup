Nowadays some creative artists have a problem with government restrictions on what they do.
On the one hand artists should be given the freedom to express their own ideas such as pictures, music, cinema etc. only when they feel their own soul and strength they can create something uniqual. Only one on one with themselves artist can see through his eyes some amazing, different staff.
On the another hand should be government restrictions on what they do, in whichever way artists wish. Some artists are unemployed and should be supported by government.
