Basically, in the modern world men and women have equal rights, which include the equal access to education. In these conditions, there are people who believe that there should be equal shares of both sexes in each subject at universities. Certainly, there are also those who oppose this opinion. As for myself, I agree with the supporters of such idea.
First of all, such condition makes the competitive entry fair due to the fact that boys and girls have similar chances to get the place at University.
Secondly, mixed classes hepls students to develop essential for a future life skills thanks to the fact that they can communicate with each other, boys with girls, they get used to live in this type of collective. This is definetly valuable, because at work collectives are usually mixed, so they have to be ready to became a part of such environment.
Thirdly, in the classes where the numbers of male and female students are equal the atmosphere seems to be more peaceful and relaxed. This in turn makes the learning process easier and quicker.
Moreover, this condition means that female and male applicants will compete for a place at University separately from each other. This will give opportunity for greater number of girls to enter successfully maths subjects, at the same time more boys will be able to be accepted in subjects like Literature and History.
Taking everything into consideration, I would like to restate my previous opinion and say that accepting the same numbers of men and women in every subject should be a rule for universities.
