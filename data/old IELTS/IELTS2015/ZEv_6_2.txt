Nowadays there are some schools that have problems with the behaviour of its students. Such problems may be caused by various situations that students shave to face and we should somehow solve this situation with bad behaviour.

To begin with, unappropriate behaviour of students may be cause of the environment in their families. For example, one of my classmates from time to time sad bad words to his friends or even teachers and there were some awful fights he took an active part in. Such accidents were because of his father who also used bad words in his speech and once was imprisoned. His son, undoubtedly, just copied his behaviour. Moreover, some students may behave in an unappropriate way because other students or teachers do not notice them and they show off in order to draw attention of other people. 

However, there are some ways to improve bad studentâ€™s behaviour. One possible solution is working with a psychologist. Many schools have such a person who is able to understand the real circumstances that make students behave in a certain way and help them to improve their behaviour. In addition, school administration should be aware of the family environment in each particular family and provide parents with some advices that may help them to mature their children and teach them the right ways of behaving.

All in all, I would like to point out that many factors like family or school environment may affect students behaviour and schools and parents together should work out solutions that can improve bad behaviour of some students.
