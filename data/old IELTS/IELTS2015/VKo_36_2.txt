Nowadays there is an idea that creative artists can express their ideas and values whichever way they want. Moreover, government mustnot permit any their actions. There are different points of views on that score. But to my mind, creative artists should have freedom of expression of their opinions while this freedom have not negative influence on other people.
First of all, some artists may express their ideas in amoral way. It is normal for some people to use bag words in their songs or films just because they think that it is the only way by which artists can express their emotions. And in modern world the majority of children listens to it by the Internet or on TV. As for me, this fact will affect them if parents or even government donot restrict amoral ways of expression of ideas.
Secondly, if creative people can do everything what they want, they may also use illegal means of expression. It can lead not only to an increase of illegal actions, but also to the situation when all people may consider that these actions are normal.
Thirdly, the freedom of using different means of expression of creative ideas, in particular amoral or illegal, inflicts negatively on standards of picture, music, litreature and so on. In such situation people cannot understand what is good, beautiful and what is bad and amoral.
Besides, thinking about the idea of freedom of expression by creative people, there is a question: why can only talanted artists use this freedom? To my mind, if a person can write books or music well, it doesn't meant that he/she better than other ordinary people and may have chance to use freedom of expression of their views.
To sum up, every points of views has rights to exist. But to my mind, people should not forget that we live in one society and every person have a right to be protected from amoral or illegal actions by the government.
