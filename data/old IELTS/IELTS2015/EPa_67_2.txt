Some people think that ways of improving public health such as increasing the amount of sport facilitites are better than others. Others think that it is not the best way to achieve aim and there are many other ways of improving public health. In my opinion, big amount of alternative sport facilities is better than other methods of increasing public health. 
Firstly, government can advertise popular types of sport which are able now for public. For example, they can give more money to school for promoting some kinds of sport which are in need now. Secondly, effectiveness of increasing the number of sport facilities is less than advertising of sport with using brands or popular people or may be pop stars. Nike is a good example of it in last year. They use such popular people as Lionel Messi or may be Lebron James and it has good effectivenes for their fans and for passive people. They become more active than before. It is the fact!
On the other side, if you has not some alternative kinds of sports which you prefare you will not become healthier. Furthemore, you will be more passive. As an example we can analyze our university (higher school of economics HSE). There are many kinds of sport which are able for every student now. The main kinds of sport are football, basketball, swimming and some others. But there many people who do not prefare the main kinds of sport and they want go to gymnastic for example. And because of it we can say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sport facilities. Moreover, big alternative to choice creates an interest for more than one sport. And people think to try each facility for more active life. 
To sum up, it can be clearly seen that big amount of sport facilities creates biggest interest to sport and to active style of life.
