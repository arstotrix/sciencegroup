Nowadays the popularity of the high education is expanding. But there still is an inequality in the proportion of male and female students in different subjects. There is an opinion that the universities should accept the same number of students of both gender. I partly agree with this point of view. Firstly, it is harder to communicate in the group of the same gender. Ladies may start jealousing when they have only few boys or none of them. Boys, in their turn, will not be able to concentrate on studying. They can talk a lot with each other. Secondly, it is always difficult to organize some student's events without having both boys and girls of the enough amount, the tasks in such situation are given for each persons to use this human's potential and characteristics. 
On the other hand, I mostly disagree with the statement. First of all, I believe that there is no available opportunity to fix this problem. We cannot make people enter the subject of university they do not want only because we have the disproportion in gender. Choosing a way of living is the personal decision. Secondly, I guess that if the persons do not want to study, he will use any suitable situation to avoid it. No matter how many boys or girls are in your group or class you will find the chance to district your mates and yourself.
In conclusion , I want to say that it would be definitely better to solve such problem as disproportion in gender on each faculty, but right now I do not see the solution.
