The question whether creative artists should be totally independent in the way of expressing their ideas or there should be limits for them, still has not got an exact answer. Personally, I'm sure artists have to be given freedom in self-expression. This essay will analyze why it is the only possible way.


Firstly, really creative people have been known from times immemorial as not only artists, but as individuals who look far in the future, bring truth to people and inspire them to change the world to the better, so they need to be heard.


Secondly, any government restrictions can not make a true artist silent. His poems, music or films may become even more wide spread then before due to intake instinct of people to be free, in reading or watching something as well, and restrictions will only stimulate people's interest to creations of the artist. Our country experienced it in 20 century.


However, there is a belief that independence in creating of any art form has bad consequences. Artists are not saints, and some of their works sometimes include immoral content, which spoils person's spiritual world. Moreover, such art can influence people to bring harm to society.


All things considered, I believe the positives of giving freedom to artists outweigh its drawbacks. Art is pure in its nature, if a person is a true artist, his works will only benefit the society, and the question who can be considered as a true artist is another issue to discuss.
