The presented table illustrates how many people work in different spheres of economy (hotel and catering, building, technology, education) in the UK. The table includes information for two years: 1998 and 2006.
According to the data, the number of people engaged in each sector, has experienced a noticeable change since 1998. In 1998 far more people in each age group worked in building. The most dramatic was the change for technology â€“ we can see that jobs in this sphere are much more popular now. In the age group 18-25 35 times more people work in technology now. For technology two groups of middle-aged people are approximately 7 and 13 times respectively bigger now compared to the data of 1998. Trends for hotel and catering and education are more steady, although we can also see some fluctuations.
