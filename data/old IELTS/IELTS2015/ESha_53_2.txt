Nowadays, there are a lot of ways of increasing level of public health. The vast majority of people think that sport facilities is the best way of improving health, but other people think that sport can not influence on our health and government should use another ways. Who is right?


On the one hand, sport plays a great role in our life. People who going in for different kinds of sport or simply do working exercises are more stronger and healthier than others. Moreover, those who fond of sport usually eat only healthy food, do not smoke and drink alcohol. In my opinion, government should build more sport centers and increase another sport facilities. They should stimulate people to be going in for sport and be fond of healthy life style.


On the other hand, sometimes sport can be dangerouse.  A lot of proffesional sportsmens have various problems with their health, for example broken leg or arm . Today we live in the modern world in which there are a lot of different ways to improve health. For instance, healthy food is very important for our health. Government, should prohibite fast food cafes and advertisement of their products. Another way of healthy life style is reducing factories and cars, which polluted our air, water and ground. We should use more safety things for our invoroment.


To sum up, we can see that sport has its pros and cons. Usually, it occurs to be healthy, but sometimes people can find more suitable way for them to be healthy.
