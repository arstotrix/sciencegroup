It is generally believed that not only creative artists but every person should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas, in other words - to express their own freedom, in whichever way they wish. Citizens often think that there are must be no government restrictions and punishment, because it restrict our freedom. But does freedom of doing wherever the artists want is acceptable and usefull for our society and their own lifes?
I partly agree with the opinion that artists can express their ideas in whichever way they wish.
I firmly believe that people should always be given the freedom to express their own ideas, because that is one of human rights - to express freedom, to express our ideas. That is what everyone should get from democratic society and government. As a result of expressing freedom and ideas of creative artist we can observe the development of art.
But there are some notions we should consider. Firstly, the freedom to express ideas in whichever way we wish can hold to situations then the "product" of someone's expression of idea can not be suitable and acceptable for other people. There is the pluralism of values and opinions in our society, that is why some one's art can hurt feelings of citizens.
Secondly, not every piece of art must be allowed. Especially, then we speak about some pornographic art that should be accept for common public, especially for children.
Thirdly, we should notice that some kind of art need government restrictions. It is widely acceptable that "art" that can be recognized as illegal must be controlled by the government.
In conclusion, I want to underline that nobody can restrict our freedom. The development of art shows the difference between generations and enrich our culture. But on the other hand - not every art must be allowed and acceptable.
