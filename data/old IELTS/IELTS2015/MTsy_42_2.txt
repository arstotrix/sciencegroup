Nowadays, there are a lot of people all over the world that have some sirious health issuses, because of the lack of the sport activities in their lives. Some people claims that building new sport centres and facilities will help to increase the level of the society health. On the contrary, other people believe that other activities should be use to up the quality of public health.
Building new facilities would have certain benefits and positive effects. Firstly, it could make a better condition for a lot of residents: they would have a lot of places where the will have an opportunity to take different classes near to their houses, consequanetely it can increase the number of people, who do some sport on regular bases. Secondly, it will also provide an chance to find a perfect kind of sport for every single citizen because of the accses to the variety of different sport location.
However, unfortunately, this kind of developing a new method can lead to zero effect. Firstly, even if goverment are able to build handieds of new sport centres, it will not change people's mind to try some healthy lifestyle, and it could bring only a disastrious money waste. Secondly, increasing the level of the people sport life can only be achieve by using a complex of different measures like populatization of healthy lifestyle through commercials and press, providing public health exerciseses and make agitation to attract more people into this new kind of life, that will be much better for them.
To conclude, I would like to say, that increasing the number of sport facilities is great option, but it will work only with the tight integration with other methods, because this kind of improvement had been already done before, and because of lack of the enthusiasm and information has failed.
