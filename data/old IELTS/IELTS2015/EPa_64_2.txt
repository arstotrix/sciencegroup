It`s a well-known fact, that nowadays the majority of people sitting in front of computers, work in offices all day. Many of them suffer from overweighting. Some people say that the best way to improve people`s health is by increasing number and variaty of sports facilities. Others, in contrary, proclaim that this would have little effect on people`s health and that other measures are required.
On the one hand, increasing the number of sport buildings can let people doing in for sport. They will do what they wants. Becydes, employees can go to the gym after the difficult day at work. They can relax and talking about, for example, political problems with their friends improving their health conditions instead of watching TV or playing computer games. 
On the other hand, it is not enough to create sport facilities. You need a well-planned advertising campaign to made people doing something for example swimming, jogging, playing tennis. It`s an urgent problem of every state when there are endless opportunities to do sport but people avoid them. In addition to that, parents must made their children doing fisical work, speaking with them about good influence of sport on their health, education. 
In my opinion, if you want to feel yourself happy and successful you should use any providing sport facilities. 
In conclusion, I`d like to notice that nowadays every state in the world aimed on creating opportunities for their nation to be health, rich and friendly. But it is impossible without increasing the number of sports facilities.
