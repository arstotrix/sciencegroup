As for now, unpaid community service is hot topic for most of us. I see both advantages and disadvantages in this type of activity, like improving the neighbourhood and working for a charity.
First of all, let’s talk about advantages of being the unpaid community service a compulsory part of high school programmes. I believe, that charity activity and helping and teaching to youngers can teach olders what it feels to be kind for others, can show us what we can better than we already are, and also what we can make our world better and much more beautifull together. It’s really awesome I think, so if this initiative used properly it defenitely should be a compulsory part of high school programmes. 
And which is lead us to another side of coin. As all we know, we live in beautiful country, but still we have a huge amount of fools. Some people can not understand this initiative properly and can make wrong decisions based on it. Some of students in high schools just can’t spend extra time helping the youngers in reason of hard exam preparation. They should study hard if they want to gain good marks on exam and go to the university which they choosed. So if charity activity become “must to do” they have great chance to lose marks on the exam.
So, in my opinion, this initiative can be one of the best ideas for our high school, but just if used properly and didn’t make students lose their marks.
