There are a lot of differents universities nowadays and different proportions of male and female students are there. Some people think, it will be right if proportions are similar to each other. I disagree with this opinion. I guess there isn’t a big necessity in it.
First of all, to make equal numbers of boys and girls at university is impossible. Because all universities have different directions and faculties. Boys prefer one speciality, girls are another: they choose direction which is interesting for them and useful for their future. That’s why proportion can’t be equal. There is stereothyp that men like math and women like humanity science.
Secondly, I’m sure that there is not a big necessity to accept equal proportion because it is not important how many male and female students will be, more serious how. They will communicate wth each other, and study there. They should be serious and educated people despite of proportion.
There is a positive side of this question. Equal proporion of girls and boys will show equal right of all genders. But I’m not sure that there are a lot of people, who cares of it.
In conclusion, I’d like to say that, of course, maybe equal numbers of male and female students will help to avoid some different conflicts, but I’m sure that it’s not important how many boys and girls, it is more important that they have a great desire for studying and be friendly with each other.
