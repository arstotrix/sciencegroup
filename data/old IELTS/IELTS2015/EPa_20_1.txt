There are four pie-chapters which show the ages of the population of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and make prediction in the future for 2050.
All chapters have three sections which demonstrate percentage of people who are from zero to fourteen years, from fithteen to fthty nine years and sixty plus years old. Comparing with Yemen, Italy have more yong people. This gap is about fithteen percentages. Half of population of Yemen are adult while there were only fourteen percentages of Italy in 2000.
The dynamic for 2050 year is worse, because the number of old people will increase for both countries. But in Yemen with small growth of old people there will be lage growth of adults.
