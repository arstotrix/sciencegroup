There`s a belief that increasement of number of sport facilities will deffenetelly improve public health. However some people claim that there are more effective meassures to make people healthier.
I`m partly agree that making more sport facilities government will effect on public health. For instance there will huge diversity of kinds of sports. And it will surely help anyone to find a suitable sport. And unfortunatilly it`s the only advantage I found relativly this policy.
On the other hand, there are another measures of improving health. Firstly, government should deny genetically modified products, which cause affects on organism. For example, recent times the immune system became weaker as it lacks of essential and natural vitamins. Secondly goverment should improve the quality of medecine equipment in order to make clear diagnoses, which will help in healing.
