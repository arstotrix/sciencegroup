This illustration provides us the information about gender distribution in different areas of professional education. The data set is based on Australia in 1999. There are two main feautures of the chart, to begin with. It is a low number of women searching for skilled vocational diploma, a shift from women's lead figures in a higher education to men's significant impact in masters' and postgraduates' degrees. Indeed, it is only 10 per cent of females in professional colleges. Instead, they rather enter colleges or universities with an undergraduate or bachelor's programs. Nevertheless, females often end their education on that level with a double discrepancy in a postgraduate program and a master's degree. It is easily tradeable with 70 per cent of females in the beginning and only 30 per cent at a postgraduate level. To sum up, females reside in the "middle" of the proffesional education system, whereas males occupy margins: both jobs of worksmen and scientists or researchers.
