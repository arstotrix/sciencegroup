1.	The graphs show the reasons for studying and the amount of support received by students of different age from employers.
It is clear that studying for different career purposes is more popular among young people, whereas talking about more mature persons studying for some personal interests is of a great interest. For example: judjing by the last two charts of the first graph, it is obvious that the amount of students over 49 years old who are chosen some course to be successful in their career is approximately 4 times less than the number of those who decided to study for their own interest. The next interesting point is , however mainly the amount of students in the first graph differ quite a lot , the last but one two bars are absolutely equal, so among people between 40 and 49 years old it seems to be the same way, in which they prefer to study. 
The second graph illustrates the percentage of employer support given to employees divided into different age groups from slightly under 26 to over than 49 years old. The level of support declines gradually starting from over 60 percent of support at the age of under 26 and reaching its minimum at the level of approximately 30 percent at the age of 30 â€“ 39. But starting from 40 to 39 years it begins to climb, then it reaches the level of 40 percent at the level of slightly over than 49 years. 
To conclude, the preferences of students differ very much in terms of what kind of education (for career or for interest) choose and it depends on the age of a student. What is more, employers support is depend on the age of an employee too.
