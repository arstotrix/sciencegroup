Writing task 2.
   The problem of public health is really important. Every day the scientists find more and more desiases. But besides there are a lot of other problems hurting people every day. The problem of overweight is the most discessable nowadays. There are a lot of young children who has problems with the weight. And only sport can help to make people healthier and stronger.
   I totally agree with the opinion that the number of sports facilities should be increased. The government have to take care of the citizens. And in that case it can make people healthier. We smoke, eat fasfood, sitting home like a couch-potatoe, and only healthy lifestyle and sport can help us to avoid a lot of problems connected with health. All of us know that people who prefer sport and healthy lifestyle live longer. But thise measure by increasing the number of sports facilities won’t have an effect if we won’t understand that sport is important. But is’t better said than done. On the other hand it’s can be not enough for helping people. But may be other measures will help. In my opinion the government should make sport classes for all people obligatory 15 or 20 minutes sport every day is enough for helping your body stay fit and healthy. But if we want to create something or improve if we, one the one hand, should thing globally the children and old people. Sport classes need to be created in schools, childcarecenters and also special classes for pernsioneers. Just in that case it would make any sense. People need to understand what is better for themselves and aichieve the aim. The aim to be healthy.
   To summarize the information I want to add that sport plays the main role in our life and without sport and new sport facilities people can’t live.
