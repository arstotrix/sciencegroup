Most people think that the best way to improve the health of people is by increasing the number of sports facilitites. I agree this opinion, because any sports activity is good thing for the health of populations. The sport help people be always srictly, musculin, and it help people to have beautiful and good body. I swim and so I can speak that sport give only useful thing for the health of people. The sport  improves life people. All my family doing sports. In winter we run in sky, in summer we swimming, and another time of years we all family run at roller-sky. In my opinion, any  kinds of sports improve, and it give only good way to improve public health. In the other hand, some people think that this would have little effect on public health. Of course, they right. Not only sports may improve health of the people. But, in my opinion, the sport is very useful and the best way to do it. And health of populations should be at first place.
