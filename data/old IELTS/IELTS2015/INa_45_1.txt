First of all I will start with the description of Yemen. The chart shows that in the year 2000 the amount of people in the age 15 to 59 was 46,3 %, but in the years 2050 this member increased. Than I want to compare this information with the information that was given about children between 0 and 14 years. In 2000 the number was quite huge (50,1 %) and in 2050 this number decreased. It was almost 37,0 %. It means a lot for the population. Right now there are a lot of little children and teenagers in Yemen. It depends of the political situation there and of the religion rules. On the one hand this tendence good for Yemen. But on the other hand the amount of midleaged people also grew, and they will need help and support when they’ll got old. In the case that the young generation makes just 37 percent of all people live there, with the no one will help the old once. The situation in Italy is much worse. In 2050 there will be too much old people. There is almost a half of all population of Italy. And there is just 11,5 % of young people. It means that the  number of young people should goon or the whole nation can die. In 2000 the situation was much better than in 2050. If we’ll compare the data we’ll see that the amount of middle aged people between 15-59 2050 decreased. And the number of old people increased. There are a lot of differences between Yemen and Italy. But the common thing is that in both cases the young population is dying.
