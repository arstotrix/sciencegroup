Task 2.
   A matter of considerable controversy at present is whether sport facilities are the best way to be healthy or there are other ways to improve health. Some people say that everyone should increase taking exercises attending fitness club and so on. While the opponents claim that there are other measures like taking vitamins or eating fruits and vegetables that make people healthy. As for me, I am pretty sure that only sport can support man’s immunitet and make everyone healthy, so the raise of number of sport facilities will improve public health.
   First of all, increasing the number of sport facilities will involve people in sport. For instance, if the government open sport schools for children parents will be interested in attending these schools by there children. So that children can improve there health and be involved in something exept studying or video-games. Secondly, increasing the number of facilities will allow everyone try sport. Because not everybody can do sport because of lack of sport facilities. Thats hy public health will increase. Moreover, everyone knows that sport as it is supports not only health, but mood. For instance, the blood plessure is increased, the blood is full of oxygen that makes person feel happiness. So, if there’ll be a vast majority of sport facilities, people will use it and will be healthy.
   The opponents believe that the big number of sport facilities will be ineffective. To begin with, not everyone will have a wish to do sport, so it does not matter how many sport facilities will be. However, I am absolutely sure, that the number of facilities influences on people’s wish. People become more interested in sport facilities, they want try it, know what is it.
   In conclusion, I strongly believe, that the increase of sport facilities can make people healthier, but also public health depends on their wish.
