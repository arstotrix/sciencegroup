There is a point of view that universities should have students of both sexes in equal proportion. I completely disagree with this statement. In my opinion universities should not worry about sex of students. 
First of all I want to say that the main aim of universities is giving important knowledge and skills to students. Men and women are equal in their rights so they can study in universities. For instance, my mom and my dad were studing in one university, but their group was consisted of male students generally because men usually are better in mathematics and so on. Equal proportion of student is not a function of university. Your knowledge does not depend on your sex.
Secondly, I want to say that gender tolerance is a part of state policy and universities can not do anything if government of the state do not allow to teach women. As far as I know in Saudi Arabia women can not go to the university. So I want to say that this is not a university policy that is government policy.
Also some subjects are known to be more female. For example, phycologie or some nurse courses. As I said women usually like these professions more than men. So universities should not regulate this tendency.
To sum up the information about education of students of different sexes, I want to say that the universities should provide useful knowledge because it is their most important function and gender policy is not problem that universities should solve.
