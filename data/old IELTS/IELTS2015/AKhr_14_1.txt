The bar chart presents data about different levels of post-school qualifications obtained by Australian men and women in 1999. The overall trend is getting high education namely by men. The percentage of men, obtained master's degree, which constitutes 60% is higher than the percentage of women, obtained Master's degree, which constitutes 40%. Also the percentage of men held postgraduate diploma is higher in comparison with the number of women held postgraduate diploma. The percentage of women held postgraduate diploma constitutes 30%, so there is a drastic difference between levels of education of men and women in  Australia. It is necessary to stress, that the percentage of men held skilled vocational diploma is considerably greater than the percentage of women, which constitutes only 10% in comparison to 90% of men. However, the number of women, got undergraduate diploma is bigger and the percentage of men and women held bachelor's degree is practically the same. To sum up, there is a tendency of getting high education namely by men. But, according to data on Bachelor's degree, we can assume, that the rate of high education in Australia is rather acceptable.
