Nowaday because of different things influencing teens behavior, they sometimes behave bad by the time they are at school.  People suppose there’re different things may affect students and what leads to such situation to let’s try to ennumerafe some of such things.

	Firstly, some people suppose, that the reason of such bad behaviour among teens may result from they spend to much time on the Internet or in front of the TV screen. The first argument in favour is that today there s a lot of violence teenagers are able to see on the Internet. That affects their psyco, so they are in danger to become agitated, nervous, impatient. Moreover, they may communicate with unknown people, who propagandize bad things, such as abnormal talking, agressive behaviour and this can lead to a bad communication in reality, because a person prefer chatting instead of real communication.

	On the other hand, there are people, who are convinced, that students behaviour depends mostly on the atmosphere in their families. Children may become ignored and aggressive because of this just because they don’t get enough attention at home. They just don’t know, how to behave in the society. Besides, sometimes parents explane to their children what is bad and what is good and it results in teachers are those, who are able to teach teens how to communicate with others.

	To sum up I’d like to say, that as I think it would be a great solution eighther to limit time children spend on the Internet, so they better do sport with other children for example, or to organize some special trainings for young parents and to explane them some rules of how they themselves should behave with their children. Children sometimes try to copy their parents, so the elders should understand it and pay attention to those things that they do or say while staying near a child.
