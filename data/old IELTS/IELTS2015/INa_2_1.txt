Wr. 1. The pie charts provide information about the percentage of population by age in two different countries in 2000 and in 2050.
   Firstly, The Yemen has more children (more than 50 per cent in 2000). The second place took average aged population (15-59 years). It was 46,3 percent in 2000. But as scikentists predict the percentage will change by 2050. The group 15-59 years will increase (57,3 per cent). due to the falling the number of people 0-14 years. In this group it will decrease from 50,1 percent to  37 percent.
   Italy has a contrast process. There is the largest number of people aged 15-59 years in 2000 (61, 6 percent). But it will be drop in this group in 2050 (46,2 percent). However, the number of oldest group will be grow (from 24,1 percent in 2000 to 42,3 percent in 2050). Similar with Yemen the number of children will decrease but it will be small drop. 
   Taking everything into consideration it can be concluded that the population of Yemen and Italy changes differently. The number of people will increase in Yemen thanks to average aged people. In contrast to Yemen Italy will have a growth of population due to the oldest group (60+).
