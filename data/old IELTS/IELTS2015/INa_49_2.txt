Writing task 2.
   One of the most urgent problems nowadays is the health of population. Somebody says that providing more sports facilities will be helpful! Other argues that it is not enough, and some more serious measures are needed. To my mind, sport is not the only measure that is needed and I will try to explain my position.
   First of all, a good diet is necessary. Of course, it does not mean avoid eating. Oppositly, a good diet means combining all nutritional elements which are needed, so that the body will feel better. For example, a good diet means avoid overeating in the evening, meals have to be different, and the main point is to know your daily norm of proteins, fats and carbons and do not break these norms.
   Secondly, improving populationâ€™s health should become the main topic in mass media. People must see that the health of the citizens is endangered because of plenty of factors and something has to be done. Consequently, this problem will become known and maybe there can appear a mainstream to take care of the health, and ways of improving it will become more popular and even essential for every person.
   Mainly, the role of sport in the improving heath is really big, nobody argues. But the sport should be combined with some other measures to be effective. Sport facilities are good for people who do not have serious problems with weigh or health, otherwise some measures - such as keeping a diet should be held firstly.
   Initially it is necessary to say that people are mostly attracted with something that is popular. So, if the improving of health becomes trendy, more people will be interested in it. After these, sport and diet should be combined and the result will be really good in such a case.
