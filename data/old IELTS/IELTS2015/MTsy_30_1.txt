The chart provides some data about population of Yemen and Italy in 2000. All the information about population is separated into age groups. Also some projections for 2050 are given.
First of all, we can see that vast majority of italians were from 15 to 59 years old in 2000. In comparison, a share of 15-59 years residents from Yemen was aproximately under the half of the same year. The most interesting feature about Yemen population is that only 3,6 per cent of all people were 60 or more than 60 years old, while about a quarter of italians were at the same age in 2000.
Approximately a half of Yemen people were young. To compare, the share of people from 0 to 14 years old was about 14 percent in Italy.
By the 2050, situation in Yemen is predicted to be changed. From 15 to 59 years old people are going to increase in amount. Moreover, the share of elderly people in Yemen will rise by 2 percent. The same situation is going to happen in Italy. There will be more elderly people, but the population of 15-59 years old people will decrease by 15 per cent in general.
To sumirise the information from the charts, the shares of young and middle-age people are approximately equal and form approximately all the population, while elderly people in Italy has significant share.
