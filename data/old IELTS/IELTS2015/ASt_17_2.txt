The idea of accepting equal numbers of male and female students seems to be an absolutely new one, at least I have never heard about it before. Thus I would consider it absurd , moreover I don't see any reasons to agree with this statement. Firstly, I believe that it is your personality that matters and not your sex. If someone wants to improve the eqiciency of any group to be equalling the number of men and women he runs a risk of having a lack of smart or creative people. Secondly, the number of men is less than the number if women. After taking this measure we will get a new problem of a misproportion in the society , it means people will start thinking that social rights of both genders are broken. Thirdly, an important detail mentioned in the statement is subject. Everyone knows that there is a division of subjects on tunkal, social, economic and so on. In some subjects men to well and others- women. If we have to accept equal numbers of male and female students in every subject it will to a lot of harm to this scientific and practical approach to studying these subjects. For instance, men are good in mathematics while women are good in languages. Another good example is different positions at work, men succeed in management , but women are more responsible, and they are good secretaries and receptionists. Finally, I would like to say that this measure does not seem efficient but it even seems harmful for many spheres of society and for the society itself, and it is the reason why I can't agree with the statement.
