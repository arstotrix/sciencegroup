The table provides data concerning underground railway system of six cities. The description of each includes information about the date it was opened, how log is its rowte and kilometers and, also, how often people use it during a period of a year. The last one is given as passengers per year and it is counted in millions of people.
From the table we see that, out of six cities, London was the first to have its own underground railway system. It was opened in 1863 and now it is also the one with the longest route, which counts up to 394 kilometers of tracks. However, it's passenger density is not the biggest and it is less than half of the same parameter of Tokyo, where the number of passengers per year reaches 1927 millions. This is despite the fact, that there length of route sums up to only 155 kilometers.
The city of Koyoto seems to be an outsider it this comparison, as it has only 11 kilometers of tracks and, on average, no more than 45 million passengers of this means of transport between European countries and United States of America.
