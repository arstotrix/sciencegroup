It is often started that students prefer to work or travel for a year before entering the university. There are some arguments for and against it.
Firstly, it should be mentioned that this year helps young people to adopt after school life to a real adult life. Thay have a whole year to understand what everyone wants to do. May be some think that working gives an opportunity to get some professional skills ans knowledge. Some people beleive that this year is a chance to choose the right road. Moreover, it is said that young people can study or learn something new and their grades will be more competitive to enter the universwity. Besides, students who have work, they have a chance to get money for university studies.
Other people argue that this period si really stressful for some students. Young people usually have good relations with their classmates and probably together they can reach grades quicker because of everyday support. Furthermore, for example, a student miss a year and travel all around the world, he understands that he does not want to study. In this case he will have not got any university education and diploms. Thus he will probably have problems of getting a job. By the way, poor family can not allow this year because of financial problems if their son or daughter choose travelling.
To sum up, it's up yo students to decide which road or way is more appropriate for them: to travel or work or to study.
