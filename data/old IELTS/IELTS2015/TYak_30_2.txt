It’s a common fact that there are a lot of different problems with students in schools. Some people believe  that there are not many causes of their unstandart behaviour, but others don’t support this point of view. I think it’s a very interesting question that should be discussed.

First of all, it’s a well known fact that schoolchildren are the most difficult group for understanding. It cannot deny that nowadays schoolchildren like the majority of people have a lot of various stresses during thie workday. In my opinion these stresses can influence on children that is why sometimes have a bad mood that lead to their not understanding behaviour.

Secondly, it’s important to mention that every person should have a good education, to earn much money, to be successful, therefore every child wants to be successful like his parents. They should be good of all subjects in schools. If they cannot reach this fast, they start to have some problems with their behavior. This an example of successful family. 

Thirdly, it is not a secret that child is mirrow of his family. If a child has some problems in the family, he will show these problems in society. For instance children often use “unnormal” works to express therself. The reason of it can be using “unnormal” works in their famaly.

To make the conclusion, one can say that this true that sometimes teachers have some problems with student behaviour, the main the main for is their famoly.
