The question of human’s personality is the keystone in the psychology science. Some people believe, that our inborn characteristics play a viral role in our future life, while others think that the opposite is true. They suppose, that upbringing and experiences are much more important. Let’s outline the weakest and the strongest points of each point of view.
First of all, we all depend on our genetic heritage. It influences not only our health and body pecularities, but our mental characteristics too. That is why children are sometimes behaviour like their parents or grandparents. Our genes contain special information, that can determine our character, our type of personality. Special abilities is also what we get from our ancestors. Some people are good at sport activities, others prefer math, another are remarkable for their prodigious memory.
On the other hand, inborn characteristics can be encouraged or repressed by the upbringing. Children’s personality is formed at the age of 3-8. And parent’s influence has the crucial role. Moreover, even if you don’t have an ability to learn math, with patience and determination you can reach all your aims. There are plenty of examples when children from unhappy families, which parents have problems with alcohol addiction or something like that, become a successful people with a bright career and a happy family.
To sum up, I would like to represent my personal opinion. I prefer the second point of view. To my mind not everything is depending on our genes. People build their life and their personality by their own, and it is very important to understand it.
