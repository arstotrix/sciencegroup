Artists are creative people who can not seem to do in clamped conditions. They need the freedom for creativity. If the government will give full freedom to the full creative individuals is whether this will lead to the growth of creativity in the country?
	When creative people will have more time on the more dethailed blown by his work it will be excellent in all respects. Such people make your life easier and they may be will be able to invest all their energy in only a favourite things. Artists will paint their pictures as much time as they want. Artists can prepare carefully to the views. But whether it will hinder all progress of art? Apart from everyday problems, creative people can be faced with the human factor, such as death. Many works will be not finished by death. Maybe more creative people will abuse this freedom and will lead racket. In this case, creativity will subside and not seek new works. In the lives of creative people will not be disnayed the lives of ordinary people who have state all fees. 
	Finally, I think that people who want to engage in creative work must live like common people. If they desire so much great work that will be high-level. Great works are always born in the throes of life. They know all human life and display it in all colors as they are able.
