Many people believe that increasing of available sports facilities will result into improvement of public health. However, some people strongly disagree with this point of view as they think that these changes will have too little effect on the level of public health. To my mind, increasing of amout of sports facilities can be an important step to achievement of good health of our society.
Firstly, I would like to say that some people can not affort themselves doing sports because of the price which facilities are sold by. If the new facilities will be cheaper, lots of people would have been able to do sports. As a result, more people will be physically stronger as well as prepared to difficult work.
Moreover, increasing of sport facilities such as water pools will led to increasing of people doing water sports in our society. Doing water sports not only a type of fun but even a good physical practice thats why it can help to reduce amount of heart desiases.
On the other hand, one can say that there are different ways to improve health of modern people. For example, our government should spend more money on growing heathy vegetables and fruits because our food can make as stronger if it does not contain poisoning substances. Delivery of healthy products to all people is important at present, when approximately all people prefer to eat junk food.
To sum up, I would like to say that it is both important to increase number of sports facilities as well as to do other steps to protect people from deseases and illnesses.
