Children, who studying in schools, which placed in countryside often doesn’t trying to make good impression on school’s teacher, so many of them want to  ? their way of doing social life. And now it’s a big deal for them to solve this problem. Nevertheless we need to ? what kind of environment does cause it and what can we do with it.

Firstly, there are a lot of social elevators which help children to socialize. The first social elevator is a family, if there is a bad family, you’ll get a bad-way-socialized child. And if somebody wants to solve a problem associated with the child, he should to look at his family. Many modern European countries even developed special departments, which can take a child from the parent, if they think in necessary. But before  we do a mistake we need to find out, what kind of behaviours of children do we need, why after all, every children, even in countryside, must go to school, and why must they make this social life just as teacher wants. I think , it’s a harmful idea to make everybody must go to school to make what teacher wants and as teacher wants, and so, after school, children will do only what the government wants they to do.

So, if parents want their child may go to school for having new knowledges and to home education, he may go to school. But if they, or their child don’t want to go to school he mustn’t go there, and then his behaviour will be quite enough good. Teacher must teach children, mustn’t correct them. I finished.
