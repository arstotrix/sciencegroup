Task 2.
On of the main problems of moder society is low level of people`s health. Many people think that the amount of sport facilities should be raised, so that it will help to make people`s health better. However, there are those who don`t think it will help to solve this problem and something else should be done.
   First of all, we should agree that sport makes our life better and our health stronger. Everyone heard in their childhood that morning exercises is very helpful in order to be more flexiable for illnesses. But we must go further. I mean the sport facilites on the street (tennis, basketballs courts, icerinks in winter, e.t.c.) it will be good opportunity for people to spend their free time on the street, breathing fresh air, than playin video games or watching TV.
   Don`t remember, that it will be helpful for our children to be more sportive and healthy because they will spend free time playing sport games outside.
   However, some say that increasing sport facilities will have little effect. They think that such things as new medical centres, healthy food, diet is more useful. Due to the latest researches they might be right.
   In the conclusion I would like to say that both are important. Combination of sport, good medicine, healthy food can help our society to become healthier. Becoming healthier means that we will happier.
