This table presents us information about how much people of different age groups worked in different spheres of labour in the UK in 1998 and 2006.
  The overall trend is that popularity of low-paid and requiring less skills work, as hotel or catering service and building fell steadily with growth of the age of employees both in 1998 and 2006. Also, in comparisson with 1998, people in 2006 tended to choose this kind of job with less and less enthusiasm.
  We can also point out some peculiarities for  particular groups of people. for instance, 56 and over aged people seemed to work more than in 1998 in all spheres, exept such hard work, as building. But those aged 18-25, as it appears from the table, in 1998 used to work more, than in 2006, with an exeption such as the technology sphere. Figures for those aged from 26 to 55 have had no significant difference in 8 years.
