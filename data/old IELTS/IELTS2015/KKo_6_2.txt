There is a widespread debate about improvement of public health in the world. The aim of this essay is to discuss two points of view.
Some people think that it is necessary to increase the quantity of sports facilities. Only that can really improve public health. It seems for me not a good decision. In Moscow there are many sport centers but it does not reflect on public health. There are some reasons for that. The first reason is money. Itâ€™s rather expensive to go to the sport facility, about twenty thousands rubles per year. The second reason is time. It takes more than hour to go to gym. Therefore, if the government decides to improve public health by increasing the number of sports facilities, it will be right to make a free access for them and place sports facilities near transport stations and bus stops.
Other people insist that other measures are required. First of all, the public health depends on right food. Government can ban GMO products and provide the consumption of local goods. The second measure is social advertisement. Mass media can be used to promote healthy way of life. Also government can set the higher taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. However, all these measures will not work without personal willing of being healthy. Some people dislike sport and prefer to drink and smoke instead of running.
In conclusion, it is needed to underline that public health depends on many reasons and there cannot be only one best way to improve it.
