The charts below illustrat procent proportions on the ages of populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projection for 2050. There will some changes in later, from view of scientists.


First of all, there are the ages group : from 0 to 10 against, from 15 to 59 years and over  60 years. Italy and Yemen to extremely different country : first one is developed and not traditional (here a mean, that bible and law are separated), second â€“ is developening and traditional: religious (muslims) keep head of whole country. What why in Italy 8 times more people over 60 years at bath mont. Add great difference between Italien (now Italian less) and years in age of 0 to 14 years, it is going down but difference will be saved 2050. 11,5% and 34,0% and 2000 14,3% and 50.1% The group from 15 to 59 years in Italy at start of 21th century was more than a half at all population, but in 50 years situation will be showing and rate will be less when 50% (46,2%). Yemen has mirrow situation : at 2000 was 46,3%., at 2050 57,3%.


Finally, I think this two country uncomparisanable and have got two different way of developing. But what Is need to maintain that, in both country's whis is data is growing.
