 The charts show the main reasons for study among students of different age groups and the amount of support they received from employers.
The first chart shows that reasons for study depends on the age very strong. For young people the main reason for study is future career. For instance, 80% of people who are under 26 years old make their study to find a good job. For people, who are over 49 years old much more important is their interest in subjects. The percent of people who study for interest rise steadily with their age.
For people who got study for career we can see different tendency - the number of those people slides if they become older.
It can be seen that the percent of people who are supported by employers declines for people from 26 years old to 30-39 years old. Than it jumpes for people over 49 years old, from 30% to 40%.
To sum up, in different ages people have different reasons for study but the group which is most supported by employers is under 26 years old people â€“ 60%.
