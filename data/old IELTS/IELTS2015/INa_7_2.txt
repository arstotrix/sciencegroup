Writing task 2.
   Today one of the biggest problem is public health, so people try to find ways to improve it. Some people believe that the best way is to get more sport facilities. Some people argue it is not. This essay will discuss both sides of the issue.
   On the one hand, often people cannot find the time or place where they will do sports. It happens because of their business, their sport, job and so on. Increasing the number of sport facilities can help such people to start training. They will find a comfortable one even for them. For example, the majority of people says that it is the main reason.
   On the other hand, if a man or a woman want to be healthier, he or she will do something. Such little problems cannot be stronger and a person , who want to be healthy, will do sports despite them. Because of it many people think  that other measures should be required.
   As for me, I strongly believe that it cannot be the main reason. Just because of the global air pollution, bad food and something else. I think it has the stronger effect on the public health then the little number of sport facilities. So many scientists have already proved it.
   To sum up, there are different reasons than can cause problems with health. So there are several ways to improve public health and increasing the number of sport facilities can be one of these ways.
