There are diagrams showing students' reasons for study and employer support for students of different age.
As for studying reasons, students under 26 study in general for the career (it is eighty per cent) and only ten percent study for the interest. When students get older, the level of studying for career is getting less, and level of studying for interest is increasing. In the age of 39 the level of studying for career is already 55 percent, and the other one is 25 percent. In the age of 40-49 the levels are equal. When people are over 49, the level of studying for career is almost 15 percent, and the one for interest is already 70 percent.
As for support of employers we see that the level of it for students under 26 is almost sixty five percent. Then it is going to decrease and in the age of 26-29 it is approximately 51 percent, and then in the age of 30-39 it is only 35 percent. Next ages the level is going to increase and employer support for students over 49 is forty five percent.
To sum up, the older we are, the more we study for interest, not for career, and the less support we get from the employers.
