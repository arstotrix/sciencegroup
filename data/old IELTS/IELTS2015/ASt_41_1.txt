I want to tell you about few underground railway systems in main towns of the world. The first underground railway system opened was in London at the year of 1863 and it has the biggest amount of kilometres of route (394 kilometres), but it has only 775 million passengers per year, it is more thane twice less than in Tokyo, wich has 1927 millions, on enormous number. The smallest underground railway system is in Koyoto, only 11 kilometres of route and 45 million passengers, even Los Angeles railway system, built 20 years (later, is bigger by using each kilometer more efficiently than any other country. Paris is standing at the second place at the moment and is has great apportunities to spread this system. Washington DC stands at third place from the end, but the quality is smashing, everyone who was there said that it is perfect, because America invests money in it. This is all information I wanted to give you.
