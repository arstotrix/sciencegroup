Sometimes creative people need in possibility to express their feelings or idea. Nowadays we have many types of art, which help peope to show their creative potential. There is a lot of examples like cinema, sculpture, music, etc. Many people believe that actions of creative people and artist should be absolutely free apart government's restrictions.
I can not agree with this opinion, I strongly believe that sometimes government should keep actions of artists under control.
First of all, ideas of creative people or forms of it's realisation can be dangerous for health of society. In some cases art can give a negative impact on the mental health of auditory. For example, group of creative people desided to express their personal feelings to the world throught paintings collection of pictures with cruel plot. People, who can see it, have a possibility to feel strong negative emotion and mental shock. In simular situations government should influence the action of artist with help of legislation in sphere of censor.
Secondly, results of artist's actions can lead to disastrous consequences in society. For instance, some years ago there was a film about muslim culture and biografy of Muhhamed. This film expressed point of view his author, but majority of people, who were muslims and who saw this film felt angry. They organised acts of civil desobidience (like riots) in different countries of Europe and there were cases with murder of ambassadors.
Taking every thesis into considerations, it is clear that actions and some ideas of artists should be under the control of government, because  consiquences of this activity can be very serious.
