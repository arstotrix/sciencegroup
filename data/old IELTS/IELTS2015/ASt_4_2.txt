A several centuries ago women did not have the same rights and opportunities as men. But nowadays the gap between them is getting smaller. Men and women work in equal conditions, study together at universities and schools. According to this, some people claim that each subject in university should be attended by equal quantity of men and women.
To my way of thinking, I can not fully agree with them.
From my point of view, there are some positive and some negative consequences. If we accept this, male and female will study this subject in an equal humbler and we will have equal rights and abilities. There will be no discrimination and many people will be happy. More women can get a job and make a career. As a consequence, they will feel themselves better if one women works not only with many decades of men, but with some women too. However, there are some negative effects. For instance, a number of very clever and intelligent people cannot attend this subject just because of sex. I am deeply convinced that it is wrong. We should accept people to course by estimation of their skills and education. Moreover, there is an only way to provide equal rights and opportunities for people. It is does not meter who you are - man or woman; you have to prove that you are really good student or worker.
This issue is very controversial because various people view the problem from different and even opposite perspectives. The problem is important and very crucial nowadays because it is closely connected with a wide range of problems. To same extend I can agree that we have equal numbers of male and female in certain subject, but I believe that it is not be a main factor in acception.
