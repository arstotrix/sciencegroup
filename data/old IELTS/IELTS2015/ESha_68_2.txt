Nowadays, there are a lot of discussions about public health improving. Some people claime that the best way to get the population more healthy is the rise of amount of sport facilities. Others say that it is better to find other methods.


On the one hand, increasing the number of the sport centres or stadiums can help to do healthy lifestyle more available for people. If the government or private organization built, for example, a swimming pool in small town, the population of this town will do more sport and it let them to be healthier.


On the other hand, the increase of the number of sport facilities is not enough to improve public health. It is important to develope other measures too. First of all, people should change their mind about their diet. The number of people, who really want to be fit and try to have healthier diet is too low. Thousands of people eat fast food or other fat food everyday. McDonald's, KFC and other fastfood companies advertise their production everywhere : on TV and Internet, on busstops and builboards. Moreover, this companies try to attract children by organizing special events.


From my point of view, the governments should provide the politics which combine all view of people. The increase of sport facilities number is not enough, if we will not try to improve and develope other methods. Only the combination of all measures can help people to rise the level of public health.
