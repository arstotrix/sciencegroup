There will be an increase of people who are sixty years old and the decrease of children aged from zero to fourteen both in Italy and Yemen form 2000 to the year 2050.
   As it can be seen from the graph which illustrates population of Yemen the number of people who are aged from 15 to 59 will grow by eleven per cent. Moreover, the percentage of children who are not older than 14 years will decline notably by almost 13 per cent. However, the quantity of people aged more than 60 years will grow insignificantly by only 2,1 per cent. Two other pie-charts demonstrate that in Italy the number of people older than 60 years will rocket dramatically by almost 18%. Then the quantity of people from 15 to 59 will drop by nearly 16%. Furthermore, the number of children will decline unsubstantially by practically 3%.
   To sum up, some tendencies such as growing in the population of old people and declining of children are the same in two countries which have different political systems but warm climate. However, some changes in the number of population of different ages are not equal.
