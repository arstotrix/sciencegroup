Generall speaking art is a form of self-expression whether this is through writing, painting, music or film. Many artists are well-known because of their contriversial outlook and criticism of the government, especially in the case of dictatorshipos, force limits on artistic expression in the form of censorship. Put differently, artists should have the right to express their own ideas in whatever ways they like. 
In my opinion, creativity to a particular extent means confident and without this confident artists could not produce attractive art works in the ways they prefer, and in that way their work coukd convey all their ideas effectively. 
Obviously, artists are generally considered exemplary individuals who aim the progress of humanity, some could have vested interests in creating frictions in the society. Art could be used as a fool to create such tentions among different groups of people, especially in a multicultural environment. For example, there many cases where Indian film makers have included socially sensitive materials. 
Undoubtelly, there should be no government restrictions in art, because creativity is a way of worldwide progress. Noiwadays without any kind of freedom we can not impove our personal life. There a lot of examples when restriction in film, music or in other sides lead  to problems. USSR is an excellent example. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that artists should not have any restrictions of government because it can lead to problems.
