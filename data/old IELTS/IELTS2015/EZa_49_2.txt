I concede that it is good for artists to express their creative ideas in many different ways they like. However, I do not think that it is useful to let them do it freely without any concern from the government.
We are living in the liberty and democracy country, so not only artists but also everyone has truly rights to do what he or she wants. Creative artists, in particular, can feel respected when they have freedom to show their ideas to the world. They may feel people believe I them and always wait to see their new ideas such as words, pictures, music or film. In addition, this feeling can give them motivation which makes them create more wonderful production.
Nevertheless, it will be too risk for the government to have no restriction on what artists do. Some violent and erotic paintings may be drawn everywhere in the streets like walls, park benches and even in the schools. It can be worse. For example, an artist goes to a museum, and he suddenly has a new idea about his new picture. He may draw his thoughts on some cultural heritages. He ignores the rules of the museum because he is free to express his idea in any way. Those things will destroy the beauty of civilized streets, the solumnity of buildings and galleries. The worst thing is that children can be badly affected by some abstract paintings for which they are not old enough to understand.
In conclusion, it is essential to make creative artists feel free to product more new creations to the life. The care here is that artists should be aware of using their freedom cleverly and the government should always care the creations of their citizens.
