At the present time more and more people have difficult bind of problems at any stage of life. Due to big number of unhealthy business the solution should be founded not by them, and someone should be must dicide something.  In any case, as we are, publisity do not know how excectly solve this problems. Some peope think, that many thing caused be done is increasing the number of sport facilities. Do they right? Or are any more action to protect people from suffering?


From my point of view, If is not the first neceseary things to do. Sport is important factor of our shape, but what we have round us is worse. I write about air pollution, first of all. The extremely worse fuels from cars influent on our health, especialy on brething. Goverment must control the level of air economy. Secondly, I wont to say about food.  If is no second for any one the genetic GMO is a basic of a food goods at markets and supermarket. What do we eat? Billis as we not â€“ it is only thing which we are thinking about.


On the other hand, sport is important too. Especialy for generation, whis were bou after the war, or if we speak about Russia today, after the USSR was destroyed. Sport stimulate all our skill, and mostly the heart system and breath mocking.


To sum up, I believe, there are no one solution for unhealthy of population. A lot of factor influence on our life. Sport could help for one generation, bat what about future? Society and goverments of countries should create a complex of different action to solve problem.
