Today more and more people start to take care of their health. The mankind has a tend to pay more attention to doing sport. But how to motivate people to improve their health? Some people claim that government should provide human beings with more sport facilities. However, others consider that it is not effective and government should establish other methods of motivation. I will try to discuss briefly both point of view and to give my own opinion. On the one hand, increasing the amount of sports facilities, perhaps, will lead to a lot of people begin to do sports and improve their health. But, personally, I believe that it is not enough. It is very soft motivation for starting to care of health. Short commerce video, banners on the streets and articles in newspaper and magazine are more efficient. Government should play more attention to being sure that all people of their country is awareness of need to do sports. Moreover, to improve public health governoment should create some laws about requires for salesman about the quality of their products. Because healthy food is one of the most essential part of healthy lifestyle. Furthermore, we need to struggle with such problems as smoking, alcohol and drugs. For instance, set some kind of punishment for smoking and alcohol sale. To conclude, I would like to say that public health is very important issue. So governoment and people themselves should pay more attention to possible ways of improving motivation of human being to follow healthy lifestyle.
