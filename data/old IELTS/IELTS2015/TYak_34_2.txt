Every day all the schools all over the world face with students’ misbehavior and try to overcome these problems. I suppose, there are two main reasons, which may make children have some problems with relationships with other people.

First of all, I claim the main cause of such kind of problems is some conflicts in child’s family. It is alway a great stress for a boy or a girl if parents argue all the time or if one of family members is sick or dead. Children just do not know how to cope with their worries or have no close friend to discuss the problem, and it results in misbehavior.

The other basic reason of behaviouristic problems is usually a lack of social experience. As far as I know, children, who have not ever been in a kinder garden, face a lot of communication difficulties at school. The way they are talking to parents and the way of chatting with friends are not the same. That is why such coach potatoes often seem to be strange for the rest of the community.

To my mind, the best solution to cope with this problem is to organize some psychology classes for all the children. Individual classes will allow children to speak out their emotions and feelings, while the team work would be useful for shy children to overcome their scare of communicating to someone now. it also will help students to know each other better, so no one will seem to be black sheep for others.
