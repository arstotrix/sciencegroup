The table shows the underground railway system in six cities.
Thirst of all, we can that subway in London was opened in 1863, was 394 kilometres of route and 775 millions passengers per year. Then we'll describe Paris, the capital of France, which was opened in 1900, was 119 kilometres of route. Every year 1192 millions people use the underground there. Subway in Tokyo was opened in 1976, was 126 kilo of route and 144 mill every year. Then goes Kyoto where underground was opened in 1927, was 155 kilometres of route and 1927 millions passengers per year. On the 4th place in this graph we can see Washington DC, which underground was opened in 1976, was 126 kilo of route and 144 mill every year. Then goes Kyoto, where underground was opened in 1981 (11 kilo of route, 45 mill people per year) and Los Angeles, where subway was opened in 2001 (28 kilo of route and 50 passengers per year).
In conclusion, we can clearly say, that the most popular social transport like underground is in Tokyo. In Kyoto people maybe don't like or need subway.
