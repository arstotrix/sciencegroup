There is an opinion that raising sport facilities will help to make people`s health better, because sport is a very popular kind of entertainment among people. But some people think that we should use other methods to improve public health.
   On the one hand, those, who think that sport can help us in this problem, give their arguments. Firstly, a lot of people like sport, and if they have an opportunity, they will do different sports more actively. There is an example from my life: when I was little, we did not have enough sport facilities, but later our government decided to build gyms and places, where children can do sport. As a result, most of children in my school used to spend their free time on sport. Secondly, it is easier to develop sport, than to spend money on other measures, because lots of people can use a few facilities, on the contrary, if you want to improve medicine, you need to invent new ways how to treat people and only then use them. So it takes a lot of time.
   On the other hand, some people are sure that sport is not the most appropriate way if you want to make people healthier. They explain their position with the fact that there is a part of society, who does not love sport, and it does not matter for them, if you increase the number of facilities or not. In this case, it is more likely to use more popular methods, which will have an influence on all people and will help to improve public health.
   In conclusion, I would like to say that it is better to use differents meausres at once, and then the results will be more evident and productive.
