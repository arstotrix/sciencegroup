The graph below shows the number of people of the age of 65 and over between 1940 and 2040 in three states. The general trend for the first country is quite fluctuating (Japan). There was a little fall from 1940 to 1960 (5 and 4 per cent respectively), then there was a period of stability between 1960 and 1990, after which the trend reached the level of 5 per cent once again. In 1990 the surge began and the trend will reach the peak of 27 per cent of all men in 2040. 
Looking more closely at the trend for Sweden, it is worth saying that it is also fluctuating. There was a growth from 6 per cent in 1940 to 14 per cent in 1980, but then the trend decreased to 13 per cent in 1990. After the dramatic increase between 20 per cent there will be a little dip to 13 per cent in 2022 and then the trend will reach the second peak of 26 per cent in 2040.
Finally, the trend for the USA is not so fluctuating comparing with Sweden and Japan. The overall trend is rising. The surge from 7 per cent of the old people in 1940 to 15 per cent in 1980 was changed by the dip to 14 per cent, after which there will be a period of stability to 2020 and then the trend will dramatically increase and will reach the peak of 23 per cent of old men in 2040.
