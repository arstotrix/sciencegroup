The problem of health care is obvious nowadays. As a result of fast temp of life and working a lot deseases such as obesity came in our reality. Therefor, some people try to find a way to improve or take care about their health. One of the resolutions of problem would be to build more sports facilities. But others argue that it would not influence on public health anyway.
   One the one hand, if it would be  lot of sport centres, gyms or swimming pools around, more people could visite them, because doing sport would become more available for them. And sooner or later it will lead to increasing of level of the public health. 
   On the other hand, there is an opinion that even after getting an opportunity to do sport, those who not being interested in it, will not keen in it later too. And for instance, people who do like to do sport, yet have visited some sport centres, pools and so on or he or she, if have no enough money, just may run in the park, as an example. Furthemore, the problem of no having money is important and should be got under consideration too. Let me explain it. Even if a lot of new sports facilities will be built, it may not lead to rise in health of people, just because some group of people cannot afford to spend their money on it.
   To conclude I will say, that building sport centers and pools and gyms is a good deal of course, but we should think that all of these facilities would be suitable by costs for all kinds of money bags. And it should be said that person, who want to do sport, can find how to do it, even without facilities, to my mind.
