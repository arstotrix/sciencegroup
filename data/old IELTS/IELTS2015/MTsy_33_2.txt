Our centery is known not only as the time of innovation progress and comfortable life but as the time of unclear environment and unhealthy population. The problem is that more and more people suffer from a lot of deseases and everybody wants to know how to improve this situation. In my opinion, sport is a good method to improve our health, so the increase in number of sports facilities will give our population a strong health.
The most important advantage of rising a sport activity among people is that it helps to keep fit and make better a your muscles. All sportsmen look great and feel themselves more pleasant. Secondly, sport can be a popular activity for a group of people. They will have an opportunity to meet their friends and spend time more useful. In addition to this, sport is a very god habit and even more a future career for people, who began to go in for sport since childhood.
On the other hand, sport can be very expensive activity for some people, they will not have enough money to do it if sport becomes a popular trend in the world. Moreover, doing only sport does not give people a full protection from our air and water polution. Besides, they should eat a healthy food and spend a big amount of their time for sport, it could be bad for their job.
In conclusion, I should say that increasing the number of sports opportunities has more advantages. This tendency will have a good effect on public health if people really understand the pluses of having a sport activity.
