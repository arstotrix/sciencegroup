The charts give us an information about changes in the number of people, who travel to and from the United Kingdom over a 20-year period, and show countries, which are likely to be visited by English people at the end of this period.

At the first graph we can see that there was an overall growth. At the beginning of the period the number of people, who travelled to two directions, was almost the same, at 10 millions. By 1999 the gap between 2 members rose significantly. There was about 25 millions people, who visited the UK and twice this number of UK residents, who  went foreign countries. Before 1984 two lines rose parallelly, but a fast surge of moving abroad of english people was between 1984 and 1999.

At the second graph we can see highlight that the majority of UK residents went to France and Spain, at about 10 millions. It is bigger than number of visitors of Turkey, Greece and USA in three times.

So, by the 1999 many more people began to travel to and from the UK, but the number of tourists from UK rose twice and the most popular countries between UK residents are Spain and France.
