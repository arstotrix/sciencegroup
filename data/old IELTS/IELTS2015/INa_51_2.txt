Task 2.
   Many people believe that the best way to improve health of population is by increasing the number of sports elements and also many people think that increasing the number of sport facilities will be have little effect on public health,
   Actually, in my opinion, increasing the number of sports facilities for people will be to play a main role in this problem, because I consider that it is very important steps in desicion this topic.
   Other also agree with this opinion, because increase the number of sports elements to it isnâ€™t a main desicion of problem improve public health between population.
  There are others sports facilities for many people and they should to use it.
  The government in different countries should to increase of sports infrastructure in the cities. They need to build a new sorts buildings and increase of propagands of sports between population, espessialy between yound people.
   Overall, we can say sport is very important part our life, and everyone should do it.
