It is not a secret that all people want to be happy. But what is happiness? Some people belkieve that happiness is a profit or a some kind of material benefits. Others think that happiness is a good family or a healthy lifestyle. In my essay I will try to argue with thoise points of view and support the idea that happiness is a goid relationship with worlkd at all and how we can reach such kind of relationship.
What does it mean? I will try to explaine. As I say, for different people happiness is not the same. And some times people, who reach things that they thing lead them to happiness, are not feeling well. For example, one man think that if he have a car, he would be happy. But then he finally buy a car he did njoit he happy for a long time. So, I can nit say that it is reak happiness. I guess that the real happiness is such kind of feelings when the person is glad to see the world. He think positive and try to lead all other people to the same feelings.
Consequently, peopke can achieve the same feelings if they turn their thoughts on the positive waeves. If people was not to worry about their mistakes or some bad accident, their life can become easier. People shoulkd concentrate on solution of their troubles and not on the bad things.
However, some people can argue with me. They can think that such kind if behavior can affect themselves because other people can use them foir something unpleasant. I can say to those people this:  " Someone should start. Why it is not you?" If one person starts to improve its lifestyle then the others will start it. And some time later more and more people can live in harmony. And the harmony is the strict way to happiness.
As it were, people should try to improve their behavior and think positive. Those things can lead them to harmony with the world and the others. And this harmony is the first step to happiness or is the happiness for some people.
