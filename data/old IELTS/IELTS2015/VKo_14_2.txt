In todays modern world people could have opportunities to express their tallents. There is a popular belief that nobody should limit the process of individual art. I partly agree with such approach. It is too radical idea which can lead to dramatic consequencies.
It is indeniable that everyone can take part in creation spiritual values, for example films, books, paints, photos and other pieces of art. Nowadays we have a wide range of instruments to embody any extraordinary idea. In my opinion, it is absolutely essential for our freedom, tolerant society. Moreover, any kind of art is precursor of tolerant society without old-fashioned judgement. Moreover throughout the history we experienced some cases connected with governmental pressure on painers or writers. A relevant example which illustrated such situation ink with a famous Russian writer Alexander Pushkin and his unusial poems directed on illuminating the true face of current power. He payed a significant price for his art. 
I strongly believe that all kind of human activity must follow the rules. Creative people should take into account that they art could be under law or in out of accepted rules in society. It can be clearly seen that our creative activity could be useful for other people, can inspire to create something special. At the same time it is not controvershial activity. The majority of moder art tend to include such simple recommendations.
In conclusion I would like to say that the question of art is the most disscussed todays. It seems to me that there is no one absolutely right way to solve all problems, connected with sphere of art.
