We are given four pie charts which represent the information about two countries: Yemen and Italy. These charts reflect the demographic situation in 2000 and its projection for 2050. The highlighted years are from 0 to 14, from 15 to 59, and finally 60 and above.
The first thing to speak about is that the living rates in Yemen are relatively low, which is represented by 3 and 5 percent of those who are above 60 in the years 2000 and 2050 respectively. We have another situation in Italy: the number of those, who are above 60 is expected to almost double. The number of growh-ups in Yemen is expected to shorten from approximately half of population down to nearly 37 percent. It is clear, that the number of adults from 15 to 59 is the majority in both countries: 46 percent in Yemen and about 61 percent in Italy.
