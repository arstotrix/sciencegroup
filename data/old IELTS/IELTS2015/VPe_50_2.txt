2)	There is an opinion that in universities shares of students of male and female gender should be equal in every subject (50/50). I am absolutely disagree with this statement. There are two main reasons to find this opinion wrong. 
First and the strogest reason is festures of subjects. Everyone knows, almost every university has a lot of various technical, economical, social and other departments . And it is not casually, that in technical department percentage of male students is much more. Obviously, men’s mind works another way and mathemacs, physics and other technical disciplines are easier for the most part of male than female students.  
The second cause of my point of view is variety of social roles due to gender. When we talk about democracy, we cannot exept demographic problem and duty given to women by nature. It can seem retrospective, but I believe, woman should think about offspring first, and only than about her career. Of course my opinion stand on the country of modern of modern democratic thought and a lot of people, especially some feminists, liberalists and so on, can argue with me, but I find traditional family system, when a husband makes a career and his wife grows kids , more reasonable. That’s why I see no reasons to give some additional bonuces by gender by entering into university. Although I see no reasons to restrict the female part of population too. 
In conclusion I find present educational system decent, because every student has a lot of choises and it does not depend on sex. There is no necessary changes by this issue.
