Task 2.
   People argue on the ways for public health improvment. One groop believes that the best way to reach this goal is to widen the number of facilities to do sports. The second groop finds this measures useless and wants to act differently.
   On one hand there are many people who can’t do sports because of sports facilities absence. They may want to do sports and have time for it but don’t have a sports center or a swimming pool nearly. For this people health level can be improved by increasing their ability to do sports.
  On the other hand sport is not a decision of health problems, because they can be caused by many different factors. For example, in Africa many health problems are cosed by the lack of clean water but the abcense of ability to do sports. Some people just can’t do sports. For example, they had a hart atack lately. In this case there health can’t be improved in such way.
   In my point of view, we should solve different health problems in different ways. Only cooperation and coordination of different methods can make population healthier. If we just build sports centers it won’t solve the problem of starvation or keep us from all the desease. However, if we use different measures all together, mankind can become healthier.
   All in all, people will always argue on different purposes and the problem of health improvement is one of them. Some measures can be better than the others but live can’t say that any of them can solve all the problems. There should be a nomber of measures.
