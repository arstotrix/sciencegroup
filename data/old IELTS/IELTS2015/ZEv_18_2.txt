There are problems with student behaviour, which we can found in any countries and any times. It may be any problems connected with relationships between student and teacher or between students. These problems can making schoollife terrible, if people would not try to solve it. 

In my opinion, one of the reason for bad student behaviour is missunderstanding. Sometimes student do not understand what teacher want and why. For example, student do not recognize why he have to do hometask, came to all classes. He do not understand that he need it.

Sometimes students cannot to start relationships between each other. Then they feel stress and uncomfortable. It can be cause of problem behaviour too.

I strongly believe that all this problems can be solved, if teacher and student try it. Sometimes peopel need just to tolk to each other to solve any problem. Students should have a possibility ti discuss their problems with teachers. It will make teaching process more comfortable and pleasure. Moreover, if students and teachers will have a relationships such a friend, they would avoid a conflict.

In conclusion I would say that it is a neccessary to have good relationships with classmaters and teachers to be successful in studing. It may be hard, but you can to changhe the situation just to tolk to other people and discussing problem.
