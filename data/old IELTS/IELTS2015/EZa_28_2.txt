Actually , the meaning of the word "happiness" is hard to explain. In my humble opinion it is connected with many factors, such as health, society and nature. We should have number of things to achieve happy life.
Firstly, it is crucial in achieving happiness to have good relationships and friendships. What I reckon is that society greatly affects people's life. We can't become happy without any people nearby under no circumstances.
Secondly,tomy mind, we are where we live. Nature is necessary part of our lifes and humanity will not be happy if nature is ruined.
Frankly speaking, there are millions of scientists and philosophers taking up this problem. the problem is still in defining word "happiness". I think it is too hard to define happiness because of the width of his meaning. As an example, not everyone thinks money is happiness but many millions think in this way ( Henry Ford).
In conclusion I would like to put all information in the nutshell. Honestly saying, I also do not know, what happiness is. As for me, it is tasty meals, friends, sunrises. Obviously noone can say, what is "absolute happiness". What is the main part of being happy is to stay tue to yourself. Everyone wants to be happy, it takes a lot of time.
