In today's world when everybody says about democracy a lot of people claim that creative must artists have to be given the opportunity to express their ideas in words, pictures, film as they prefer. But the others think that they must have some possible government restrictions on what they do. Let us start by considering pros and cons of this opinion.
First of all, I want to say that creative artists should always have the freedom in what they do. On the one hand, the creative people can be a reason of technical, social and political progress in the country. They see the world from different side. If we remember the greatest researchers, scientist, writers, politicians, we will see that they have the opportunity to change the world or the country as they want because they can understant more in comparison to common people. On the other hand, if the individual wants to have the estetic pleasure he must do what he likes. But if we have some government restrictions and we do not love what we do it is not good for our mood, nervous and helth. And, besides it, if we want to live in democracy we must be provided with the freedom, especially the artist, that are the representatives their country in the other world.
But there are people who claims that public people have government restrictions on what they do. They say that their freedom can be a reason of the international conflicts as we saw it between Russia and Belarus.
To sum up, I would like to say , that both opinions have their strong sides and I believe that in near future the balance between this two opinions will be found.
