Task 2.   
   Some people say that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities. Others, however, say that this would have little effect on public health and that other measures are required.
   Nowadays there is the main trouble for government offices is the public health of population. So how we can look for some decision for it?
   The first type of people say that the increasing the number of sports facilities is the best way for increasing of level by public health. Of course, this event can be cause of totally grows by amount of sportsmen, because almost all countries in the world have low level infrastructure. For examples, Siberia or different countries of Africa can not say, that this countries have all condition for sports event. That is why for my opinion all countries must take part in this problem and built a lots of stadium, swimming pool etc.
   On the other hand infrastructure is nothing, if man does not want to develop himself. And in my opinion the main part of this trouble is bed-organisation propaganda. To the end of 20 century almost all west-countries was legitimased by electorat with help of sport is still the second part of life of course our generation does not want to be a sportsmen.
   To sum up, all two part is important for deceding this trouble.
