There is no doubt that in our current society we have access to many things that could completely destroy our health. So while our health in danger, we should improve it as much as we can. But how we are going to do it? Some people say about increasing the number of sport facilities, but others argue that it causes just little effect on public health and think about other measures.


We know that sport facilities improve our infrastructure allowing us to do sport there. First of all, if government build, say, stadium for few football teams, that teams will become bigger because of students that wants to play on a good new field. Moreover, football sport in that city will grow more and maybe other kids will be interested in that kind of sport. And this “evolution” takes place in every kind of sport. Besides, people who just want to stay in shape, prefer not to go too far from their own home. In that case, they often prefer not to do sport if they have no sport facility near to them. And it is not good.


On the other hand, we have many different ways to improve public health, like eating natural products, drinking clear water and so on. Even if we talking about sport, some kinds of traditional games will fit perfect. For example, Grand Run in Chicago when thousands of citizens run through the city, or runs from bulls in Spain.


To conclude, I want to stress that, of course, sport facilities have a good impact on public health and promote sport all over the country. But we cannot forgetting about other factors that make influence on our health like clean water and good level of medicine.
