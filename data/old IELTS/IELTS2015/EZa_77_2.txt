Nowadays there are loads of artists of different kinds, for example, singers, drawers, poets and such other. Should they have freedom in expressing their ideas? Should governments put any restrictions? The topic is worth discussing. 
On the one hand, artists cannot survive without freedom. They need it to create, to make something new and innovative. They can create really wonderful paintings, songs, poems that will be pleasant for most people. Some artists have a special way of thinking and they make something different, which no one else can repeat. For example, Van Gogh paintings are obviously impressive and it takes time to understand the idea of creator. Thanks to such artists, people can broaden their horizons and learn more about modern culture. Moreover, they can start to create by themselves and it is really useful for human race.
On the other hand, some artists have strange ideas to share with public. And sometimes these weird things can hurt other people, even their soul. For example, heavy metal can be harmful for children. Despite that fact that it is allowed to listen to it, such kind of music might hurt kids’ ears. Furthermore, there are painters who like to draw naked bodies doing some strange actions. Obviously, it is also very harmful for people’s mind. That is why governments should care about artists’ freedom.
In conclusion, it is obvious that artists should be given freedom to express their ideas. However, there must be some government restrictions on what they do to remove negative influence on people.
