Rapid development of the several instruments of broadcasting information, otherwise unstopable increase of educational level among planet's population defined extremly high level of public attendancy to the new forms of art and cultural expression. This seems to be a great advantage of XXI-st century, but still there is an argue about, whether the artists should be controlled by government restrictions or not. Actually, modern democracy, supported by most of powerfull countries includes the notion of the freedom of speech, which implements the idea of right to say whatever you want at any moment and adress your message to anybody. The problem is that sometimes your own ideas, and therefore their artistic form could be offensive to another man. So it was with the "Pussy Riot" performance, which was actually being judged as a harrasment and vulgurous behaviour. This is a good example of the situation when the art went wrong. On the other hand, some concerts of such bands as "Lyapis Trubetskoy" and "Okean Elzi" were banned in our country according to their so-called "protest" lyrics. This situation would be best decribed by the word "unfair", because surely talented and outstanding artists are not allowed to provide their works under the tremendous hand of contraversial policy. To conclude with, it is important to understand that each action, especially which is done in public should be regulated by law, based not only on the law-maker's believes and preferences, but also on common sence of moral and human values. Nevertheless, there should be no chance to transform the regulation law into a weapon of unlimited cenzorship, which is as far as I can say the most dangerous and probably the most effective tool of the constructining awful and malicious political regime. Freedom of speech is a freedom to say, not to stay silent.
