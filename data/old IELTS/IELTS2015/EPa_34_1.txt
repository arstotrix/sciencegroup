Four oie-charts show us changes in the graduation of ages of the populations of two countries: Yemen and Italy throuth the time. So we can see that such group of population as teenagers grow from 2000 to 2050 in Yemen if the orognozes come truth. And the polar situation is shown in the pie-charts for Italy, where numbers of teenagers fell down from 61,6% to 46,2% and numbers of 60+ years people grow up more than in twice. In this fact we can say that population in Yemen will getting younger and population of Italy older. Our projections approved by such fact as that numbers of children in Italy probably decrease and in 2050 it will only 11,5% instead of 14% which were in 2000. And in the population of Yemen this aspect have more positive projections for 2050: the numbers of children will increasing. If we summarise the information we see that projections for 2050 for Yemen are more positive than for Italy. We can only guess the reason why situation shown by pie-chart has such character.
