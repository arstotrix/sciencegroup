Nowadays a among people interest sports and own health. So topic of increase of public health interests on the macro and micro-level. Increas the number of sports facilites making sports availiablity for each people.
One side increasing the number of sports facilites making sports availibal for people, who don`t many or other causes. For example in our contry to the Olimpic game in Cochi 2014 buldinged lot of sports objects, that would be give to citezen. So would be opene  more sports cours.
