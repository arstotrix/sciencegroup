The horizontal bar chart featured in task 1 provides information about the proportions of male sand females who held different levels of post-school degrees in Australia in 1999.
It is seen that men who held a skilled vocational diploma 9 times outnumbered women (90 percent versus 10). However the percentage of undergraduated women outnumbered the percentage of men. Females occupied about 70 percent of them and the rest 30 percent occupied males. Moving on to bachelorâ€™s degree one can discent that the percentage of males and females was practically equal and the difference was about 5 percent (women outnumbered). Turning to the data about postgraduate diploma it is noticeable that men outnumbered women twice. Also the number of male masters is more than female ones but not so much.
To sum up, it can be seen that the percentage of men outnumbered the percentage of women in three of five point under consideration.
