   Task 2.
   Many people understand that it is important to improve public health. But, there exist different opinions or the ways of realization this idea. Some people think that it is important to increase the number of sports facilities. Others consider that other measure are required.
   On the one hand there exist a lot of sports education programmes which are made by professionals, who can teach people to have healthy sport life style. From this point of view sport programmes and sport as well can improve people’s health. In particular, sport makes our immunity system better. It (sport) can also keep us away from different bad habits.
   However, the other hand some people consider that increasing the number of sports facilities can’t solve all problems and improve public health. These people think that there are other measures and ways to reach the target. In particular, there can be developed modern health care system. This measure will be more efficient because sport can’t cure hard deceases like cancer. Sport also can’t keep us away from being infected by wide-spread viruses. So it is important to create high-developed health-care system, which will have enough medicine and doctors to cure all deceases.
   But to my mind the answer is in the middle. In particular, it is important to increase the number of sport facilities, because sport improves our immune system. But it is also significant to create high-developed health-care system, which will cure ill people.
   In conclusion I’d like to say that it is impossible to improve public health using only one measure. That is why it is important to use different methods together.
