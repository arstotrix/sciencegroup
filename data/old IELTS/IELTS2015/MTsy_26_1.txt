The pie charts show the percentages of ages of the population of Yemen and Italy in 2000 as well as a prediction of the changes in 2050. These age groups are: children to 14 years old, people from 15 to 59 years, and eldery people of age of 60 and more.
In 2000 in Yemen the biggest part of the population was people under 14 years whereas in Italy the biggest part of the population was of age from 15 to 59 years. More over, there were approximately 4 times more children in Yemen than in Italy that years. however, the amount of people over 60 years was bigger in Italy where it was about 24 per cent, meanwhile the amount of elder people in Yemen was about 3,5% only.
The projections show that the situation will have serious changes in the future. The amount of middle age group will take more than 50% in Yemen. Furthermore, the amount of people over 60 will increase from 3,6% to 5,7% in 2050. Also, the prediction give us information that percentages of the youngest age group will fall from 14,3% to 11,5%. Also, we can see that the percentage of eldery people will unsurprisingly level up to 42 per cent in 2050. This means that there will be twice more old people in Italy in 2050 than it was in 2000.
The chart shows that percentage of population will have enormous changes in 2050.
