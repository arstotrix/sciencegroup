It means that not only the middle age people start doing sport, but also the young man and girls do the same. It can help to have a perfect fisical forms and shapes, but does it really works? On the other side, where is mush more effective way to make yourself more healthy: it is a healthy food. In comparison with fitness club it is much more cheap. Everyone can buy it in every shop.

For example, a poor student studys in big city in the university, he has no money to visit fitness centre, but he has enough money to buy healthy food. In addition, he can combine these two aspects at home for free. To sum up all opinions, we can find the best solution.
