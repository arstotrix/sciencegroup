Task 1
   So, we can see 4 pictures which shows us the ages of the populations in 2000 and projections for 2050 for two countries: Yemen and Italy.
   Yemen in 2000 compitly “young” country, only 3,6% of population older then 60 years. Half of the population are children younger then 14, and 46,3% are people in age from 15 to 59 years old. In Italy population in 2000 poor for children 0-14 years old, it`s only 14,3% of population but richer for old men – 24,1% and people in age of 15-59 years – 61,6%
   On the graphics with projections for 2050 Yemen increase the population of older people from 3,6 % in 2000 to 5,7% in 2050. But lose in amount of childrens, from half of population to 37% in 2050. Now the prevalent group of  Yemen population is young people in age from 15 to 59 years. Italian graph of projections on 2050 shows a kind of ballans between groups of older people 42,3% and young people from 15 to 59 – 46,2% of population. Situation with amount of childrens slow down, from 14,3 % in 2000 to 11,5% in projection for 2050.
