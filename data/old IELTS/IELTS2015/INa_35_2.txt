Task 2.
   Nowadays people thinking about their health. Some of them believe that goverment, should increase the number of sport facilities. Other disagree with this opinion. They think that it won’t bring any benefits.
Scientics consider that one of the best way to be healthy person is to do some sport. First of all, different sport facilities help to fit our body, which is  important thing, if people to improve public health. What is more, to do sport much cheaper than to visit doctors, use not traditional medicine and so on. Not all people can afford buying exensive massages or other things. Thirdly, if people prefer sport facilities then other methods, it means that they will eat good and healthy food. However, most of children prefer to do some sport than using other methods its we know, children are our future. If parents, make their children to do sport, children will have a drug for doing it, when they grow up.
   Nevertheless, not all people consider with that opinion. Many of  them say that other methods are more effectively. First of all, not traditional medicine bring big benefits for our health. Secondly, if you want to do sport, you need to have free time. Due to job school, university, not many people have free time for sport.
   Thirdly, some people have problems with their health and they cannot do the same sport, like can do healthy people. Take, for example, people who haven’t legs or arms.
