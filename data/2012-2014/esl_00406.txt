Russia have significant ethno-cultural diversity and it is very important problem to document all of the endangered languages. In the last decade theoretical work on the development of methods which would allow accomplish this task was carried out, including methods of text glossing in the languages of minorities.
The purpose of my course work is to identify morphological and phonetic peculiarities of the Adyghe language. The work consists of transcription and interlinear text glossing of Adyghe language, as well as its analysis on the basis of these data.
First a small story in Adyghe was recorded on a recorder. Then the text was transcribed with the help of native speaker. The transcription was recorded with the IAF system. It helps to identify the peculiarities of pronunciation in this language, as well as dialectal peculiarities. Finally, the text was glossed and on the basis of it I made morphological analysis of language.
All the hypothesis based on previous studies, for example "Аспекты полисинтетизма: очерки по грамматике адыгейского языка." by П.М.Аркадьев.
