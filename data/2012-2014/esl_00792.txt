Nowadays, space exploration develops quite rapidly. Having investigated the Solar system, scientists have started the exploration of other stars and their systems inside our Galaxy. Space exploration finds new ways: the newest techniques and ideas are applied in this field, and one of them is the idea of space tourism. 
As for me, such kind of tourism is extremely helpful both for the space explorers and for those who will travel. Scientists will receive cash resources to continue their studies and obtain the most accurate results, while the tourists will experience unforgettable impressions. More of that, it seems possible to teach some of them to do something simple at the space station, so they would have a possibility to feel like real spacemen.
Certainly, this question is ambiguous. Some people are sure that the rich should not interfere in the process of space exploration, even in a role of tourists. One can predict that, once allowed to enter the spaceship, they will try to impose their own laws and change the world of space exploration in accordance with their personal interests.
I agree that such fears are not absolutely groundless. But it seems to me that if the person is interested in space exploration, he respect the laws and the orders of this sphere. I think that the examples of rich space tourists like Mark Shuttlerworth (who dedicated his flight to educating South African youth and conducting scientific research) will be numerous in future.
To sum up, for me space tourism is an activity which will be helpful for everybody and I hope that, even though some risks remain, it will improve the world of space exploration.
