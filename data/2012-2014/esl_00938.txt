The problem of generation gap is very ancient. Misunderstanding is the cause of it. Neither the parents nor the children don't try to understand each other. The children are too agressive, and the parents are so annoying, when control their teens. I think, that kids and parents should hear eeach other. Moms and dads want to help their youngsters, they afraid that something bad may happend with the children. However, they don't forget that their little babyes have become maturer. they know, what to do in various, even the most complex situations by themselves. I believed, that the parents shouldn't control their teens too much, but and the youngsters should understand the feelings of their mothers and fathers.
