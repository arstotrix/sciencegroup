The UK faced the problem of waste recycling with which authorities had not managed well. During a four-year period different UK industries had wasted 3,700,000 tonnes: 800,000 tonnes - in 2008, then it drops to 700,000 tonnes - in 2009, but in 2010 it reaches a peak - 1,200,000 tonnes and 1,000,000 - in 2011. Local councils understood the problem and tried to solve it somehow by investment in waste disposal. They spent 1 million euros in 2008, 1.5 million euros in 2009, the same amount of money they spent in 2010 and in 2011 authorities spent 2.5 million euros. During this period local councils received a great number of citizens' complaints about city programme of waste disposal. In 2008 the councils received 35,000 complaints, the next year they received 40,000 and then the number of complaints increases by 10,000, respectively, till 2011 year. 
This data shows that in 2009 year the amount of waste products went down with the growth of investments, but the number of complaints increased all the same. In 2010 the amount of investment remained level with 1.5 million euros as it was in last year and at the same time waste products reached an all-time high of 1,200,000 tonnes. So, it can be seen that citizens' discontents came regardless of the amount of money that locals had spent and the amount of wastes. This can be interpreted as money was given but there were not any real positive results, the quantity of wastes did not decrease in fact. Citizens could suspect local councils regarding environmental damage of corruption.
