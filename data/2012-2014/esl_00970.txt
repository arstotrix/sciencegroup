From time immemorial, sports involving animals have existed: taurokathapsia of Minoan Crete and modern tauromachia widely distributed today in many European countries, ancient chariot racing and horse riding in these, dozens of dog sports etc. Sports with animals are very ancient tradition which is steel popular nowadays. But it also has stirred up for a long time a dispute about permissibility and humanity of such sports. Sport is often traumatic and exacting for people too, but there is the difference between people and animals: for athletes it is their own choice while animals have no choice. Indeed, the sport himself proved dangerous to the animals: intensive training can lead negative side effects for the animals’ well-being. Some trainers torment beasts to win the competition. And also there is a lot of sport in which committing mayhem on animals is an aim, as dog fighting or Spanish bullfighting. Nevertheless, I suppose that animals’ sport can be humanity. For examples herding dogs definitely enjoy sheepdog trial and it doesn’t ask them excessive energies. So, the most part of dog sports are acceptable, because dogs are often glad to carry out master’s orders.	On my opinion the personal contact between animal and trainer excuses the animal sport, and lots of animals can enjoy the sport when it’s natural for them, but crippling animals for amusement should be forbidden.
