These days, it can be difficult to find necessary information without the Internet. There are a lot of digital libraries, social networks and other useful sites for study, work, entertainment. Some people believe that the Internet manages with its task full well. But other people tend to think that it’s not the best instrument to search some information, and I don’t agree with them. 
Firstly, using the Internet as means of entertainment, you can communicate with your friends and find new from another cities and countries, listen to music, compare notes with everyone and do many other things.
Secondly, the Internet helps us in work and study. For instance, my university has an electronic library in which students and teachers can find textbooks and science articles and download or read them online. Also we can use different sources and cyclopedies for our studies.
Thirdly, the Internet is a great platform to search everything connected with our everyday life: transport, news, concerts, online stores. We can buy tickets in advance and for less price, know everything happened in the world and buy things which we can’t buy in our country.
But on the other hand, the Internet has some disadvantages. We used to think that every book or article can be found in free access, but it’s not true. And if we didn’t manage to get it, we become lazy and don’t search it in usual libraries. This fact makes us, in some way, slaves of the Internet. The second problem is connected with human nature, too. When we look for something, we can meet an interesting link and go further and further and finally forget our true aim, but lose a lot of time.

To sum up, I strongly believe, that the Internet is an easy and rational way to find information. As for its disadvantages, they’re can be overcome by our ability to use other sources of data.
