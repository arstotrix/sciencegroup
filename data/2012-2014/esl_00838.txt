The table provides the information on the number of those who entered Bristol University in the first and second half of the 20th century and at the beginning of the 21st century.

In 1928 new students made up only 218 enrolments and the percentage of female and male students was roughly equal. The female percentage made up 42% while the male was 58%. There were few students from overseas, for example, that year only 3% of the whole number of enrolmaents were from different countries.
In 30 years the situation changed quite a lot. First of all, the whole number of students was almost five times as much as in 1928. The female percentage was only 32% and, as a consequence, the men made up 68% of the whole number of enrolments. On the other hand, the number of students who came from Bristol itself significantly decreased, only 14% of the whole.
In the 21st century the situation slightly ressembles the one in 1928 regarding to female and male percentage. However, the number of students from abroad raised significantly. In 2008 the students from overseas made up 28% of enrolled while those from Bristol declined to 1-2%.

To conclude, we may notice that nowadays people prefer to change their location for studying.
