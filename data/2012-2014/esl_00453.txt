The portrait of Dorian Grey
"The portrait of Dorian Grey" is one of the most famous Oscar Wilde's books. First of all, the plot talks us about the vanity of the person and his life priorities. The genre of this book is philosophical fiction so there is mystery in this book that helps us to see people's sins. The main character of his book is Dorian Grey, he is young and very beautiful man, he is very popular among the society. One day his friend Basil, who has been a great painter, draw Dorian's portrait. That was an amazing picture, because it was very realistic and Dorian was extraordinary perfect. At this moment Basil's friend, Lord Hary, entered the room and saw this picture. He talked to Dorian that he would be popular and beautiful when he was young. Dorian wished the picture became older and Dorian stayed young. That is amazing, but it became true. Dorian could see his real face and soul at the picture and stayed young at the real life. The society loved him but because of his avidity and greed, he had many sins. He killed his friend, enemy and made his bride and his familiar killed themselves. 20 years later, the portrait became ugly and terrible, the hands of the man at the picture was in blood and his smile was dreadful.  Dorian became angry and cut the picture with the knife. After several hours, the police founded dead old ugly man with the knife in his heart and an amazing picture with a very beautiful man near him.
As for me, I like this book, it is exciting and the subject is very unusual. Of course, Oscar Wilde also showed as people's sins. It is quite difficult to look at yourself and to find any thins in your personality. This book shows us that it is better to live and to grow old normally that stay always young. I think the length of the book is perfect because the plot of the book is predictable and this book would not be so interesting if it is too long. I was impressed by reading the great English classic writer in the original.
