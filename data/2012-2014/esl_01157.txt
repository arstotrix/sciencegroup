               Men are more interested in sport than women.
   Sport helps us to bring up physically strong, strong-willed and energetic people. All over the world people of different ages are interested in sport and sport games. Boys and girls make first steps in sports every day.
   Firstly, sport helps people to become strong and develop physically. Secondly, it makes better disciplined in their daily activities. Thirdly, sport keeps your mind healthy.
    People never stop arguing about capabilities and relationships between two genders: male and female. Some people think that men and women have different natural abilities that make them suitable for different types of work, or sport and etc. 
     Generally, considered that men are more interested in sport than women.  Let’s look at the arguments and against. Some people (especially men) have own opinion about women. They say that women haven’t  sense of purpose. Women can’t  go to the goal, because they have more sensitive nature. Women can give up sport. I disagree with this people. 
    I have another view. I think it’s not so. It depends on person and his personality. I think both men and women could be interested in sport equally. Both of them have own qualities for different type of sport.
   Because there are a lot of different kinds of sport. Men and women have very different tastes. It was the reason, why I don’t think that men are more interested then woman. 
   In conclusion, from year to year people interest in sport is growing. Everything depends on person. Boys and girls, men and women do sport, develop their results, and achieve their goals.
