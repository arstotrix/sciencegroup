   The diagram presented below shows the amount of popularity of such leasure attractions as zoo, library, theater and cinema among such three social layers of Australian residents as natives, migrants from English-speaking countries and migrants from other countries.
   Cinema turns out to be the most attended attraction amid all the social layers as 70% of natives, 65% of former residents of English-speaking countries and 50% of migrants from other countries chose it as a place to spend their spare time. The most unpopular place to visit is theater as only 20% of natives, 25% of migrants from English-speaking countries and 10% of migrants from other countries tend to go there. The library gained the maximal popularity among migrants from other countries and totaled in 55% whereas only 37% of natives and 40% of migrants from English-speaking countries picked library out for spending their leasure time there. The zoo is mostly attended by the migrants from English-speaking countries, by 50% of them, while only 41% of natives and 35% of migrants from other countries are eager to spend their spare time at the zoo.
   The percentage of natives and migrants from English-speaking countries is merely the same in all the leisure attraction taken into consideration what means that the habits of Australian residents and residents of English-speaking countries do resemble to a great extent. These two social layers give their preferences to more digitalized way of entertainment as cinema, perhaps, because of its performance-like features. Such choice of migrants from other countries as libraries may be caused by low prices or the lack of prices at all and by the desire to obtain or improve their language skills.
