Nowadays a lot of people engaged in sport. Both men and women take part in various competition and other sport events. The point of the essay is to decide if men are more interested in sport then women.
Firstly, I truely believed that all agree that today football is the most popular sport and men play football much more than women. Secondly, it can not be forget that football is the most commercially successful sport while the overwhelming majority of football fans are males. Finally, nowadays there exist a lot of popular “traditionally” male kinds of sport such as rugby, box, or weight lifting and by that I mean those sports that only men or looking good only with men engaged in.
Nevertheless, in recent years the situation changed dramatically. To begin, it can be said that many “pure” male sports like pole vaulting and ski jumping become universal, i. e. suitable for both men and women. Moreover, there appeared new female sports that quickly became popular, for example, artistic gymnastics and synchronized swimming.
However, it can be argued that the attitude to sport develops in childhood. And everybody knows that boys like PE lessons in school more than girls. Also, growing up girls begin to become interested in many other things, such as fashion, serials, and kids, so they do not have enough time for sport.
To conclude, it can be said that remaining differences in lifestyles of men and women do not allow female to become more involved in sports.
