An example of IT achievement

Nowadays we live in the world of a ceaseless development of information technology (or IT). Different people have conflicting opinions on whether this development is positive or negative. For instance, a lot of people believe that using social networks, especially from the smartphones, we deprive ourselves of normal live communication with real smiles and with a possibility to look into person's eyes.
However, there are some IT achievements which nearly everyone would consider as positive. One of them is the invention of Skype. This program allows to hear and to see a person from every spot on the globe. The children who left their parents to go abroad now can speak with them as if they were in the same room, the friends from different continents could chatter with each other as though they met to take a cup of tea. Surely, there are a lot of things to improve in Skype, like the quality of sound and picture. But in general this IT achievement became a great break-through in the sphere of communication, and millions of people have reasons to feel deep gratitude towards its creators.
