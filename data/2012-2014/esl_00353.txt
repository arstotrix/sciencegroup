Despite the popular standpoint that the mistakes worsen the speech (and so the language itself), they are an important source of linguistic information because they show how the human brain operates with the language. Also, the mistakes provide us with the information about the structure of the language and its weak points. Although the topic is widely studied, still there are a few unlighted aspects. This paper first outlines the phenomenon of the mistakes in comparative constructions in heritage texts. The present work examines the examples of adverbs and adjectives taken from the Russian Learner Corpus. The examples are estimated by the native speakers and with the help of the Russian National Corpus. The mistakes found in the heritage data are described and further classified into several types that are not mentioned in the previous works on the mistakes of non-standard speakers (heritage speakers, L2 speakers or children). Also, special attention is given to the difference between adjectival and adverbial constructions. The types of mistakes are not the same in these constructions: only few types are universal; the most part of them occur either in adjectival or in adverbial constructions. The results of the research are organized in a table that can be found in the application. The paper ends with the description of the problems connected to the study of comparative constructions in heritage texts that are to be solved in future.
