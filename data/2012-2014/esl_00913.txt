When a company is planning to release a new product, they begin to make a research, what consumers want. Then business people begin to plane a production. For example, they invent its color or size. Next, the company inspect its storage and buy all required things, such as raw materials and manufactured components. After these manipulations, workers start to assemble the product and inspection it. If the product review pass successfully, business people start to develop the advertising company, the design and the packaging of a new product. When the first party of the new products go on sale, analytics begin to analyze the sales volume. Based on these analyses, analytics say how successful this product is. The company start to thing, what to do with it.


Globalization-good or bad.
 Globalization is the process of changing to an integrated world from an isolated one. Some people think that it is a good to live in the one information space, but I do not think so.
 To my mind, globalization is a bad process to the whole world. Big companies trade their products to consumers and do not let little companies to play a role in the world trade market. So, people cannot try to eat or wear something new and gorgeous. Then, people can go from one country to another without passport control. It may lead to increase the cases of terrorist act. As the result, the situation in the world will become extremely tense.
 People say, that globalization will bring people together in many years. I do not believe it.
