This work is dedicated to the research of interactive advertisement in psychology. There are two kinds of ads. The first type, called "simple ad" has  one-line plot. The second type, called "interactive ad" has a non-linear plot. With the second type, the viewer can decide on his/her own  the plot of the ad will develop. In other words, the viewer acts as a director, thus creating a closer interaction between the ad and the consumer. 
The hypothesis of this paper is that in this case , the viewer trust  the ad more because he/she is more involved in the process of consumer-ad interaction. Trust is a very important component of marketing as well as of advertising. Thus, we propose that the more a person trusts the ad, the more efficient the sales are.
To prove this theory, we will present one group of viewers a version of interactive ad while another group will be presented  a version of simple ad. Then we will compare responses of participants by the parameter of trust.
