In different countries an age of children going to school varies between four and eight years old, because of different culture, traditions and social circumstances. 
At the one hand, going to school as early as possible seems to be a good way to educate children. The earlier start, the better result – this is the position of people, who tend to make their children to go to school at age of four. Going to school may also improve children’s social skills. Besides, parents just often have to work and have no one to leave their child with. 
On the other hand, a young person needs to have a lot of space and free time to be healthy and happy. Five year children usually can’t concentrate on something longer than twenty minutes or half an hour, which makes them unable to join school classes. What is more, starting studying at this age may have a bad impact on child’s vision and health in common.
Nevertheless, no one says that four year and eight year children will study the same at their first school year. Little children usually have short classes with some educating games and long breaks. In this case, school is no far away from kindergarten and is very useful for working parents. For example, in Russia three years old children have four short classes in a kindergarten during the day.
Finally, I believe that there is no much to argue. We can name place for young children whether school or kindergarten and there will be still no much difference.
