In today’s world there are a lot of ways to gain money. But the fee isn’t always fair. For instance, modern artists earn huge amounts of money creating pictures while other people just try to survive and earn money on food. And I believe that governments should fix this unjust system.
Every person do thing he or she likes and have a head for. Although it is true, people have different circumstances, and governments have to take this into account. The global problem affects not only modern artists or businessmen but all rich people. Governments must shorten the economic gap between social classes and make our society more equal.
As for modern artists and their creatures, I can’t say it is unfair that they get much money. Most beginners in the field of art are very poor and they also struggle to survive along with other people of other professions. And if artists become really skillful and make brilliant works, why they shouldn’t be well paid?
But then appears a problem of talent. Are rich modern artists so talented? Not always. And it’s too a problem that must be solved. Governments should create more committees with professional art critics, who will determine the value of paintings.

To sum up, I tend to think that governments should struggle with unfair situations with work and paying for it in art, and in other fields too.  Generally talking, it is difficult to have an open mind when thinking about art, but people should do it for the justice.
