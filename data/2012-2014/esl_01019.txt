Nowadays one of the most valuable problems in society is misunderstanding between parents' and their children's. This gap stems from lack of knowledge and goodwill from both parties. Today there is a tendency to create families later, than for example in 90's. This makes a big gap between parents' and children ages. For example of my classmates, who are the same age, but their parents aren't, have different types of communication between generations. But also I think that people shouldn't get despaired because of this problem. It's easy to reach harmony just by listening each other.
