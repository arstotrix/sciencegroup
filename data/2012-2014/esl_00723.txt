I want to tell about the book I read: Three Men in a Boat (to say nothing of the dog).  This book was written by Jerome K. Jerome in 1889 and was very popular at the end of the XIX century because of the novelty of the idea and the author’s sense of humorous. “Three men in a boat” has its own specificity by combining travelling notes and funny stories about three friends. It also was considered as “nearly the funniest book in the world”.
The book is telling about the Victorian era when three friends J (Jerome), Harris and George and J’s fox terrier Montmorency decided to have some rest by taking a trip along the river Thames on a boat (which is obvious from the title). They did not expect that this journey would bring so many humorous and funny moments for us but awful and shocking for three friends. During the reading readers will see not only pictures of the current location of characters but their memories and pictures of the past.
This book made a strong and deep impression on me. Firstly, the humor of the book is “forever young”. Hardly any reader will cover a smile during J’s thoughts about his illnesses, the story of the young man who decided to play bagpipe and became a trouble for his family or the moral tale about fox terriers’ craft.  Secondly, characters (it is necessary to admit that Montmorency is a competent character with its own part) and situations are realistic. Every event is the things which is typical for normal people and which is happening in the real places. Author derides routine life and shows how unprepared people can be in unusual situations. It made me reflect on what would I do in a new and strange situation. 
I suppose that readers will like “Three men in a boat”, it can’t help but to fascinate. If somebody decides to read this exciting book, he or she will spend a great time with J, Harris, George and, of course, Montmorency.
