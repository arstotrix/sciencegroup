Interior decorations are essential for a persons well being
Everyday life and things around us have a big influence on our personality, and people usually attempt to make benefit from this influence.  Thus, scientists are exploring how colors around us affect mood, there is even a special philosophical system of harmonizing a surrounding environment, Feng Shi. In ancient Rus too, there were a lot of rules that imposed how interior decorations should  be located (for example, oven had to be placed opposite the red corner etc.). Besides that, even in fiction description of the inside of a house of characters is often very important — in this way writers may say something about the characters inner world.Therefore, I think that interior items have always meant a lot to people of different cultures.
What about me, i think, it’s always pleasant to be surrounded by esthetic things. I like to have an order in the room, because otherwise it’s hard to relax or concentrate on studies, for example. And I’m quite sure that things that we are surrounded by, correctly chosen, may promote wellbeing to a person.
