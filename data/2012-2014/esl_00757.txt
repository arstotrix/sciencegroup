The chart and table show information regarding the percentage of 1,000 employees in two large companies who exercised for between 5 and 15 hours a week during 2012 and the number of workers who miss work days in the same year.
	In Birmingham department the percentage of employees who do exercises between 5 and 10 hours each week is 50%, the same percentage in London department is a little bit lower but the difference is not significant. The percentage of workers who keep themselves in fit for a large amount of hours (more than 15 hours) is almost equal in both companies. The percentage of people whose training is between 10 and 15 hours is more than twice as higher in Birmingham department as the percentage of the same in London one. However, London department has more workers who are exercising less than 5 hours a week.  
	 In respect that in Birmingham department there are more employees who are training for a lot of hours, the number of healthier workers, considering all aspects (absenteeism for 0 hours, between 1-5 days and more), is higher in Birmingham.
	After the chart and tableâ€™s review, it can be claimed without doubts that people who are exercising during more than 5 hours are getting ill less and take time off work more rarely.
