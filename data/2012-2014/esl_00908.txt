Since the ancient times sports have been playing an important part in people's lives.  Sports were used to prove your strength in a peaceful way. Ancient Greeks even set up Olympic Games to find out the strongest and the most skillful sportsmen and to praise them. Millenniums passed but people didn't lose their passion to different sports which not only increased in their amount but also changed a lot and became even more complicated. 
One of the most popular sports is football. People all over the world get stuck in front of TV during world cup. Masses of football fans are known to be unpredictable and completely out of control. Being passionate lover of football sometimes appears to be a tradition in some families. 
Though, I do not find football to be an interesting sport. For me it does not worth wasting time on it. The only purpose of this sport is running around the pitch for 90 minutes trying to kick the ball.
Of course, football is not an easy game to play, people train hard for many-many years since an early childhood  to become successful and I do respect football players but I do not admire them. 
For me the most beautiful sport is figure skating. Its' beauty is not only in mastering unusual element. It's also a tragedy, small play that skaters want to show their spectators. They are not just skating but flying above the ice. Every their movement expresses the entire emotion. While watching really talented figure skaters you admire the naturalness of the feeling they express and easiness that overfills every single motion. It seems that there is nothing impossible for them. And when you notice how exhausted sportsmen are after the performance you realize that everyone of them leaves a part of their souls in every program. That is why I find figure skating one of the most beautiful, exciting and worth seeing sports.
