There is an opiion, that it is better for children to start learning a foreign language at primary school rather than later.
From my point of view, this idea has lots of advantages. My first argument is that children tend to acquire language skills better than adults. Scientists claim, that there is a gap between early childhood and puberty, when a person can learn a language at a native speaker level. Unfortunately, this period ends at the age of 11-12 years, that's why it's necessary for children to start learning a foreign language as early as possible.
However, the same problem can be seen from a different perspective. One may say, that it can be too hard for children to learn a foreign language at primary school. Children may get stressed out and not able to learn jther school subjects. Moreover, children may start to hate learning foreign languages because of the negative experience they had at school.
Nevertheless, I belive that it is possible to avoid these problems. The process of learning should be designed in a funny and entertaining way to let the children enjoy it. If language classes are interesting, the children can achieve a good basis for future learning. It may be easier for them to continue learning languages when they become adults. Moreover, their general intelligence might be improved, because language classes always include a lot of non-linguistic information.
To sum up, I'd like to say that it is a good idea to start learning foreign language at primary school, because if a child starts doing it later, he loses some advantages that his early age provides to him/her.
