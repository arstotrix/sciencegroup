The gap between parents' and children's generations stems from lack of knowledge and goodwill from both parties.
In my opinion it's a rather contradictory question/ On the one hand the gap between two generations is caused not only by the lack of knowledge and attention, but also by difference of the cultural surroundings which produces a really huge discord of life's values and the world view.
But on the other hand the relationsheep between children and their parents will surely become better if both sides learn to communicate, to be ready for contact, to understand each other and accept each other's pecularities, learn to listen, not to judje or blame. The harmony is impossible without any effort.
That's why I can't really agree or disagree with this statement.
