Due to television sport becomes more and more popular thing to view to date. Such a situation is argued to prevent young people from doing sport rather than watching it on TV. Let’s look at this problem a bit closer and try to find out whether it is true or not.

Personally I believe that sport, and especially spectator sports, attracting attention of millions young people, gives them an idea that sport is interesting, exciting, and that you may as strong enjoy it as sportspeople do. Besides, there are many famous sportspeople, who are role models for many people around the world. For young men it is very important to have an example to follow. And these famous sportspeople very often happens to be such an example. It encourages young to do sport, to try to achieve heights as their favorite sportsman did it. There are a lot of small villages in Russia, and in the every of them teens live, which dream about great sport, dream to become Olympic champions and so on. And I do know that for many of them sport on television and their own role models in sport play a really important role in their sport lives. And I do not feel like thinking that lack of television must contribute bigger enthusiasm of teens.

There is a trend nowadays to accuse television of all of human’s sins. Well, maybe sometimes it is rightfully, but there are good features of TV too! And one of them is propaganda of healthy life and sport – and it works. In Russia, at least.
