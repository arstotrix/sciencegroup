The two bar charts show the weight assessment of people of different age groups who live in Newtown. The first bar chart describes the results over the 2010 year, while the second bar chart observes the situation in 1950.
It is noticeable that by 2010 the number of obese people had risen, especially among people aged between 50 and 69. The largest percentage of obese people during the whole period was revealed among the group 20-29 in both 2010 and 1950 years. Unsurprisingly, the share of people with an ideal figure had undergone significant changes and fluctuates throughout the whole period shown by the first chart.
In a more detailed look, the number of underweight people had been falling with an increase of age taking the least percentages in the group 30-39 and in the group 40-49 by the results of the year 2010. At the same time the share of overweight people was fluctuating just over the two periods.
