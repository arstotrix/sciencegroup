The graph and pie chart provide information on the proportion of the plant life's menaces, the level of menaces and the forecasts of plant and animal species extinction in tropical forests.  In 2000 was not such a high level of extinctions, it amounts to approximately 5000 dying outs per million species. According to the forecasts, this number will increase markedly up to 2060, when the extinctions level will be equal to 50000, increasing tenfold in fifty years. After that critical mark the amount of species' disappearing will go down and, as predicted, in 2100 will amount to 28000 extinctions per million.
As it is shown in the chart, the main reason of plant life menaces is human impact, it makes up nearly 81% of the threats, when the natural events make up only 18%. In the list of the most dangerous human impacts are agriculture with nearly 19%, harvesting with 14% and development with 10%. The most dire threat among natural events are natural disasters with 7%.
To conclude, the treats to plant life are serious, and the main threat is human activities. It is essential to change something, especially since this is in our hands, otherwise the number of species extinctions will increase rapidly.
