Now there are a lot of specialized schools: mathematics, humanities, sometimes even with a physical or linguistic bias. In this connection a question arises whether to teach children with diverse abilities differently or better that all studied have one same school program.

All people have their own abilities: some have mathematical or humanitarian turn of mind, some prefer creation. Of course it is important to develop your strengths. Each person must find his favorite workand do it with pleasure, otherwise he will be unhappy all his life. Most often, favorite thing is that in which you have the ability and talent.

On the other hand, people must develop in all directions. Educated, successful person should grasp an understanding of many things support any talk on any topic. Moreover, in the school, we still don't know exactly what we would need in further life.
In addition to it, in the school, it may seem that we are good in one, but as an adult we will understand what we like to do something completely different. For example, I had a very well with the Russian in primary school and terrible with math, but when I was in grade 5 things have changed a lot.

To sum up, it is not bad to select students according to their academic abilities, but only a student clearly understands what academic abilities he has. And develop a bit and in other directions, not throw it all for the sake of your favorite subject.
