Introductory paragraph 
The theme of my course paper is a client's locus of control and its changing during the psychotherapy.  The term "locus of control" was first defined by  J.B.Rotter as a person's generalized expectancy about the extent to which reinforcement depends on his behavior (internal locus) or external circumstances (external locus). Although this definition is widely used in scientific papers, in psychotherapy  locus of control is understood as  source of  person's decisions and judgments. Ignoring the difference between these definitions causes  substitution of concepts and invalid results in scientific researches in the field of the psychotherapy. In addition, different definitions of the term result in different views on the optimal localization of control (external, internal or medium), and consequently, on the goals of the psychotherapy. So there are several objectives of the research: showing and explanation the difference between  definitions of the term; definition and justification of  client's optimal locus of control in psychotherapy; assessment of the factors influencing the change of  locus of control; finding ways of achieving this optimal localization of control during the psychotherapy.
