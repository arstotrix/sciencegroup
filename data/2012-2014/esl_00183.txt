The spirit of sporting competition has been destroyed by the amount of money now associated with most sports.Nowadays people are very interested in sports. Even if they do not like doing exercises, they watch TV and admire others running, jumping andthrowing balls to each other. There are always sports programms on television and it brings participants a lot of money, but it would not bethis way unless there were no interested people at the other side of the screen.From my point of view sports is an absolutely mutually beneficial enterprise. Let's have a good look at Olympic Games, for example. Thesportsmen compete, do honour to their country, earn money with their talent and hard work. The audience supports them and has fun. Big companiesearn big money with the advertisement between competitions and provides sportsmen with their salary. Without this money the contest would not beable to exist.Another point to be made is that sport is connecting people and it has nothing to do with money. Children play football or hockey togetherjbecouse it is great fun and it is the way they spend time. Adults can play as well or just get together and watch games on TV.Some people might say that sport events are only organised to collect money, but I do not think that people become professional sportsmenbecause of it, but because they have talent and they do what they like.To sum up, I would like to say that although big sport depends on money it is not its essence.
