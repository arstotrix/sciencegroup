The graph and chart give information about species extinctions and the threats to plant life. The former shows extinctions of plant and animal species from 2000 to 2100 decade. The latter gives data about the threats to plant life.

A continuous and steady increase of extinctions from 2000 to 2060 year in the graph probably shows correlation between the cause of human impact on nature and population growth. It links with the chart that shows human impact on nature which is 81.3 per cent is far more than natural events. The most significant threat to plant life is agriculture which is 18.7 per cent and harvesting at 14.4 per cent.

There is a prediction in the graph that extinctions will start to decrease in 2060 from 50000 extinctions per decade to 30000 extinctions in 2100. Probably it will be because of noticeable lack of natural recourses which force people and governments to reconsider their attitude to plants and animals production and recovery.

The human impact is definitely more significant than natural events is. The point when it can provoke huge issues certainly will be in the future.
