	The two graphs show the figures relevant to animal and plant life. The first one describes the amount of animal species extinct over a hundred year period while the other one contains the information about the events that are harmful to the plant life. 
	It is possible to notice several major tendencies. In the first graph at the beginning of the hundred year period the number of extinctions per million species initially rose. That changed after 2060 when the number had begun to steadily decline. In the second graph a comparison between reasons that are caused by human impact and reasons that are caused by natural events shows that humans do much more to endanger the plant life. 
	A more detailed look at the graphs reveals that the amount of extinct species per million had rose steadily up to 30 000 between 2000 and 2050. Between 2050 and 2060, however,  this figure had increased significantly, eventually reaching 50 000. The second graph shows that agriculture is the most prominent threat to the plant life. It constitutes for 18,7% of the overall threat list. If we look at all the natural events combined, then it is noticeable that their overall percentage is exactly the same .
