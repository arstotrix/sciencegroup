Whither Trasactional Analisys: Obsolescence or Paradigm shift?
The paper asserts: (1) the heyday of Transactional Analysis (TA) has gone, (2) TA is nowadays behind the times and conflicts withsome advanced scientific thinkings. It is claimed,  TA should be comprehensively revised to remain relevant. So the paper focuses on epistemological errors of  TA and its possible remedies. The main thesis is : the epistemological errors can be corrected via an intervention of principles from cybernetics, neuroscience, structure and system approaches. 
The conclusions are as follows: 
- The return to the initial version of TA exacerbates its shortcomings.  
- TA should be confirmed and integrated with other sciences.
- Transaction analysts should disclaim naive realism in favour of social constructivism: despite the efficacy of TA concepts, they are not a reflection of objective truth. 
- TA needs a hermeneutic discussion in the position  "I'm OK, You're OK." 
Thus this paper appeals, in effect, for the total reconstruction of the fundamentals of all personality theories.
