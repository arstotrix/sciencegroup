What about me, I really like blogs. Firstly I like it as an idea, as a concept. On my opinion blogs gave as a real freedom of self-expression. Everybody can say everything to the whole word owning to Internet and world will hear him. Blogging kills a censorship, blogging equalizes us. Talented written blog can be more popular than a newspaper, so, the success of a writer or of a journalist doesnâ€™t depend of a publisher any more, now readers can decide themselves what they will read.

As far as I am concerned, I read only few blogs, if we understand by this term only personal diaries, but the news, which I prefer to read, are unofficial, in effect it is a kind of blog. I also read some personals blogs. My favorites are the blogs of the fashion journalist and of the programmer. This reading permits me to see the world in a different light, from a different perspective.
