A few words about the debates.

I consider praising the Opposition Party (the side which I stuck up for) a little bit tactless, though I can’t 

but say a few words about Nastya’s part in the discussion. I was impressed by her concern on 

humanitarian side of the problem: she had tracked down different sources dedicated to workmen’s 

conditions on the Olympiad and the sad case of homeless dogs.

It was quite challenging for us to compete with the Prime Minister’s team, but, while maintaining our 

own positions, I had impression that their arguments sometimes weren’t robust enough: “The Olympiad 

made the Russian people proud of the country”. I hope that it’s true but it would have been more 

convincing if this statement had been supported with some citizens’ quotations (from Twitter, for 

instance). As far as I remember, the main argument of the Prime Minister’s team was the point 

connected with the national pride and union during the Games, while some financial, economic or even 

political profits were slightly touched.

All in all, there were a lot of such strong arguments provided by the opponents that we had to rack our 

brains to defeat the attack. As for me, the debates were heated and interesting.
