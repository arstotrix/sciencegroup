The graph represents telephones calls, by cathegory, from 1995 to 2002 in the UK on local calls. For the first four years number of minutes increased from 73 billion minutes to its peak, which is 90 billions. However, in 2002 only 70 billion minutes were spend using local call type.
At the same time from 1995 to 2002 people spend more time on national and international calls. This time grew up from 36 billions minutes in 1995 to 61 in 2002.
The most important rise can be seen in time people talking on mobiles. In 1995 it was just 5 billion minutes and in 2002 it dramaticaly increased to 45 billions. In my opinion, it is correlated with rapid development of mobile technology.
