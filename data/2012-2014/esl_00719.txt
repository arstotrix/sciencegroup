In this review, I would like to present a young adult novel “Stargirl” written by popular American writer Jerry Spinelli. Mr Spinelli is a 73 years old writer  from a small town in Pennsylvania who usually writes children’s novels and stories about early adulthood. This author knows what he is writing about because he has six kids and twenty-one grandchildren.
This book is about relationships between extraordinary girl and pupils at Mica Area High School. Very strange girl called Stargirl who likes to play ukulele is a new student in a pretty usual High School in US. Everything changes in the school when this girl arrived. After fiveteen years of home studying Stargirl came in a 10th Grade and dashingly enchanted a boy Leo.
After a short space, Stargirl became the most popular schoolkid so the whole school could talk only about her. Suddenly, girl’s popularity collapsed and everything that has made her different before started to irritate. Somewhere in the middle of her popularity and her collapse her friend Leo felt in love with her.
In this novel, Spinelli talks about the nature of popularity – in particular, how cruel and changing it can be. However, the author gives another, more bright side of the story when he tells the story of a first inspirational love.
Every character from this novel is absolutely realistic, in addition, a flawless and light Spinelli’s style of writing makes this book easy and effortless to read.  During the reading of this book I few times changed my mind and my references to main characters what makes this book even more exciting.
All things considered, this is a well-written novel that describes adult problems in an example of an usual small American High School. Also, I would like to recommend “Stargirl” to people who like this kind of comprehend psychological genre of books.
