Nowadays there is a belief in some countries that it is a better for children to start a formal education at four years old. Some people disagree with this view and think that children have to start school just after they are seven or eight.
On the one hand, the brain is more flexible to five years old. Scientists have proved that in this period children can learn a new language as a native one. Also there is a belief that as sooner you begin to teach a child as smarter he or she will be in the future.
On the other hand, there are a lot of opponents of this theory, who believe, that at an early age child have to develop creative abilities and be free and do anything he or she want. Formal education implies a discipline. A child must be a diligent and attentive. But we cannot expect it from a four years old child. 
My opinion is that it is better to start a formal education at seven or eight years old, because children have to enjoy they life, play games and so on. 
In conclusion I would like to say that it is not bad to teach a child at four years old bat it have to be like a funny game.
