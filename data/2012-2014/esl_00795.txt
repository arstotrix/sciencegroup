Task for 14th Friday. 


The charts give information about local wildlife from 2000 to the present. The first diagram gives reasons why wildlife figures have changed in the area, while the second graph describes the wildlife population that has been affected. 
The main cause for changes in wildlife population is habitat destruction. In addition pollution, overexploitation through fishing and hunting and random factors such as accidents have played a significant role. Finally, introduction of exotic species and diseases are not the obvious reasons for changes but have had an impact as well.
Unfortunately, the tendency of decrease for most of the wildlife species is growing. Due to the problems listed in the first chart the number of insects and freshwater fish has reduced, and for this regrettable state of things the attention of society must be drawn. The figures for birds and reptiles have decreased too, but at a lower rate. Despite the trend for reduction, some populations of species increase, for instance, mammals and aquatic mammals. 
To sum it up, charts show a very significant but unfortunate results about wildlife population changes.
