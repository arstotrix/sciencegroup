The growth of online shopping has greatly improved life for the consumer

Since the world wide web was invented in the end of the 1980s our life has changed completely. Nowadays people even have an opportunity to do shopping sitting on the sofa at their own home. As time goes by, more and more shops create online service. Some of them get rid of real departments at all concentrating exclusively on their websites. However, can this tendency truly be considered as an undisputed improvement of consumers’ life?
Being able to search needed items via internet people save their time and energy. Time is not being spent neither on the way to the shop, or on useless talks with enthusiastic salesmen, or on exhausting wandering around irrelevant shops. Moreover, one often pays attention not only to products he or she seeks while shopping but also to all the others. Whereas online consumers concentrate more on their choice and do not suffer from annoying shop assistants.
On the other hand, nevertheless, there are strong arguments claiming that traditional way of shopping is still more appropriate and preferable. One drawback of online consuming is that the chance to be deceived or disappointed is considerably higher. It is impossible to tell for sure if the producer is worth trusting. Another downside is that the fun of shopping familiar to many of us is totally gone. Indeed, some people enjoy smelling, touching or trying on things they ought to buy. Online shopping deprives one of that.
To sum up, although online shopping is a great facility of contemporary consumers’ life, it can not be preferred by many people due to inevitable disadvantages. On the whole, I believe that the conservative way of shopping is more convenient and will never be substituted by any others.
