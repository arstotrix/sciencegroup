All kinds of shopping nowadays is an important part of our life. Surely, there are many people who are keen on buying things as well as many those don't really like to spend their times in shops and supermarkets. So that, there are two controversial opinions: one is that regarding hobby is a positive trend, another is concerned on drawbacks of this tendency.
In my point of view, shopping is not the best option for being one's hobby. People, who are so-called shopaholics, are so keen on buying things that they can't stop doing it even if the thing they want is very expensive and not useful. So, shopping as a hobby is quite money-consuming. Moreover, what fans of shopping don't think about is the fact that not everyone is so obsessed with it. For example, if I were to decide I would rather read a book or sleep for a while, but some of my friends always want me to go shopping with them as they are very pleased with it.
On the other hand, if it brings good mood and happiness to some people, it is not that bad. The important thing is to know one's limits and not involve everyone around in process of shopping entertainment.
All in all, I don't think that shopping is a good hobby, but every man to his taste, so there is no need to argue about it.
