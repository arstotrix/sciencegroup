This course paper can help to understand better why there are dative subjects in some constructions and the connection between verbs and other members of sentences. The work will be done on the basis of Russian Corpora .
We will watch verbs 'хотеть', 'хотеться' and 'любить', 'нравиться'. The goals of the work are to make percent differences with constructions such as : 'хочу воды- хочу пить- хочу, чтобы' and 'я люблю- мне нравится' and to make some explanation of these differences. Also we will compare combinations of verbs with in/animated nouns and the negative forms of verbs
