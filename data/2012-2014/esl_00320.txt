Language changes are one of the central issues in sociolinguistics. As is well-known, every aspect of language is subject to change, including morphology, vocabulary, case system and sound system. Every change happens with its own speed. Some changes can be observed within a lifetime of a generation and some take longer to happen. 
In my course paper I concentrate on generational changes in the Russian sound system, in particular, on whether people of different ages pronounce soft or hard sound [s] in a number of borrowed words. I also attempt to examine the existence of correlation between phonetic variants, on the one hand, and gender and educational level, on the other. Research sample includes interviewing only residents of Moscow for the purpose of eliminating such personal characteristics as birth and residence place.
