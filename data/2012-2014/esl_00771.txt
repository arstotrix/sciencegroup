Information technologies have strongly influenced our life. Nowadays we use the Internet not only to entertain ourselves, but also to study and work. The Internet has become a part of our life and also gave us a large number of opportunities. One of such benefits is possibility to work outside oneâ€™s workplace. I, personally, consider such capability as a big plus. However, every opportunity has its own foible.

First of all, there are people who prefer doing their job at an office, not combining work and household chores. Second, as any system, the Internet is not perfect, so we are not insured against transient errors. Thus, working during the journey can be easily spoilt. Having seen the flaws, let us now go to the merits.
The important thing about working at home is that people do not need to waste their time on getting to an office. Thereby, the traffic situation can be improved much, as well as the ecological. Another benefit consists in the fact that people no longer need to choose the workplace near the house or in the same city. But what makes this opportunity be truly helpful, is the fact that even retiree, young mothers and people who are not able to get to work for some reason can still be in the swim and work.    
Having seen pluses and minuses, we can now easily come to the one rational conclusion, namely that, in spite of the drawbacks, the benefits of this mobility, undoubtedly, outweigh the disadvantages.
