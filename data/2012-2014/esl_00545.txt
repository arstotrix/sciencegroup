     There is a social research before us.
     So, from this chart we can conclude that the biggest number of people attending cinema is those, who born in Australia (about 70%). On the other hand, libraries are attended more by new migrants born in other countries (55% contrary 40% and 35%), than by others. Also we can take a note that zoos have rather equal celebrity among the respondents.
     One more thing I noticed is all of groups pay little attention to theatres.
     What information might be extract from this experiment? I believe one of deductions, which we can do, is people go to the places such as cinema more often than to zoo and library; and to such as zoo and library more often, than to theatre.
     Besides, non-English-speaking migrants prefer to read books to watching cinema, because it is rather difficult to them to understand English speech, while they can read English text with ease.
