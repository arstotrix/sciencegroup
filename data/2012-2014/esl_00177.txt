From the beginning of human existence people live side by side with animals. Animals and men were initial parts of each other. Nowadays somepeople start being against the using of animals for the human benefit, while the others suppose it is inevitable part of our life.In my opinion, animals should be protected. First of all, there are a lot of cruel experiments that are made on animals. New cosmetics,treatments, food additives are checked on them. Despite we are all neutral creatures, our organisms are arranged differently and we have noguarantee that matters that do for animals are safe for us. For example, development of cancer happens differently in different biologicalspecies. Secondly, animals are genetically modified in agriculture to adopt them to environment. From my point of view it means that animals'DNA changes in unnatural way and natural selection mutilated for the sake of dubious benefit to man.However, some people say that we have always used animals for the benefit of ourselves in food and clothes in house arrangement. But in myopinion, we have started to abuse our opportunity to do this. We kill rare animals for the sake of beautiful fur when our science has progressedand we have beautiful artificial and safe products that do not harm us, animals and nature. That is why we should seriously think aboutconsuming animals' good for our benefit.       In conclusion I would like to say that there are a lot of different opinions about using animals for the benefit of humans. But we shouldseriously think about our future because everything is connected in the nature and interference in it could lead to unexpected consequences.
