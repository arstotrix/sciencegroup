There is a certain range of emotions people experience throughout the world. Various biologists and psychologists proved that there is strong evidence for the universality of emotions. However, cultural and linguistic conceptualization differs basing on sufficient facts. For example, there is no equivalent in all languages in the world to describe an emotion. Moreover, there is a variety in expressing emotions in different languages: one language can have different variants for expressing a certain emotion, while other languages could lack for such variety to express the same emotion.
            The problem of emotions in linguistics was previously considered by AA Zaliznyak [1985] B. I. Shakhovsky [1987], and by many others researches. However, despite the fact that linguistics has a long experience in the study of emotions in language, there are relevant problems in the general theory of emotions, their designations and functioning in different languages.
           The main aim of our project is to create a linguistic "map" of emotions in different languages and describe which subtypes emotions (like fear, shame, pity and so on) have in each language. 
           This particular paper is dedicated to the description of the emotion "Pride" in the German language. A certain range of words describing the emotion "Pride " is taken and examined by different linguistic means. In particular, the focus lies on examining words semantically, syntactically and revealing their similarities and differences.
