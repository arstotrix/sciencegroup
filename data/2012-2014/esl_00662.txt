Shopping is quite a dualistic process, which different people don’t treat the same way. On one hand, this is an inevitable thing we can’t live without, because we do need new clothes, books, electronic divices and so on. On the other hand, we can either enjoy it or not. For those who do, shopping may even have become a hobby. Whether it is a good trend or not is not such an easy question as it may seem at the first glance.
Undoubtedly, getting positive emotions from what you do is always a good feature for any action. Therefore if people can relax, get free from stress and daily problems, spend their time in a way to please themselves additionaly get such a considerable benefit as things necessary for life – what doubts can appear concerning the advantages of shopping’s transformation into a hobby? However, there may be some.
When people enjoy something, they want to do it again and again. Meanwhile, shopping is not an absolutely harmless thing – at least, for you budjet. If your passion for buying things gets on an overly high degree, you may lose the sense of when you have to stop, and this way become a shopoholic. Being a shopoholic usually goes with having debts, inability to manage will you finances well and therefore sometimes spoil relationships with your homemates and so on. But even when not being a shopoholic, an excessive love to have shopping may cause the same problems just at a lower level.
So, my hypothesis that shopping’s transformation into a hobby isn’t an absolutely positive trend may obviously be right. However, while not crossing the boarding line of common sense, making shopping your hobby probably isn’t the worst thing to do.
