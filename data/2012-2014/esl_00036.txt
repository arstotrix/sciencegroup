Emotional burnout can have multiple causes. The current study examines the possible influence of life events on the level of burnout. The research method includes a survey based on a specially designed burnout scale, conducted among 54 males and 134 females, mostly in direct service positions of counseling and social work. 
The study results indicate that negative life events are significantly and positively related to all three burnout scales, while positive events (i.e., promotion, pay raises, positive changes in the work environment) correlate  with the reduction in both the likelihood and severity of burnout.
Emotional burnout phenomenon is of considerable interest to researchers, because nowadays intensive communication, by which it is triggered, forms a significant part of many jobs. Despite the abundance of research in this area, relatively little is known about the emotional burnout in office workers. 
Researchers give different suggestions about nature, causes, phases of development, and sequences of emotional burnout. Every theory adds certain important detail to the description of the issue in general. Despite of the fact that many researches have been held in this field, yet there are only few facts about emotional burnout in office workers. To be more precise, there are no evident facts for what influences burnout more: personal traits of a certain worker or organizational factors of labor. It is important to mention,  that researches paid attention to  results of wok rather than to the process.
Thus, there are different directions left for investigation in this field. Especiallyinteresting aspect to focus on can be found in  behavior of office workers.
