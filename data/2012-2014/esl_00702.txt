Unpaid community service has been an upwurd trend since the middle of XX century. After two devastating wars passed, people realised that charity and goodwill must be a major part of post-war society. Now some people believe that it should be compulsory. For high-school attendus this topic is highly controversial, and here's why.
First of all, we are talking about charity and community service. How can these be compulsory? you can't force people to work for free for sake of not being expelled from school. That stops being charity  at this very moment and becomes outright slavery. It is capitalist society we're talking about, after all. You can't show teens that charity is good by forcing them to do it!
That's why all unpaid community service classes should be facultative. But that is not enough, stdents, especially around that age won't just go there and work for free. Teachers need to incept the idea into their minds: idea that such labour not only gets you work experience,  but that a student, by doing such a thing, makes the world, his neighbourhood or his city a better place. And after that, if the teacher firmly believes in this idea himself, such classes don't even need to be obligatory.
All in all, I think that community service should be promoted in high schools. This process, though, should be very careful: by no means should such service be promoted by force. High schools should be very careful in their methods, because wrong ones can make the student trn his back on charity for the rest of his life.
