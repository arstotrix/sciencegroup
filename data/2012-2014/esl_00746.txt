In the last few decades graffiti has started to be recognized as one of the branches of modern art. Conservative people may think that this is nonsense, but to me it seems only natural: street dancers were once considered troublemakers too – and now they have popular contests all over the world and dozens of films about them.  
The first thing we need to pay attention to is evaluation. Do we evaluate the style of font used to write offensive words on our fence? I don’t think so. However, practically all of us can distinguish good graffiti from bad, and that’s the first thing that makes it art – you have to be talented or you have to practice a lot to reach the highest level of your skills, like in any other traditional form of art we know.
Secondly, in my opinion, it is important to look at the place graffiti is painted. If somebody finds it acceptable to paint on the walls of the National Gallery, this person is most likely to be considered a vandal, and that would make sense. But if these colourful and meaningful pieces of art find their place on the dull walls of prefabricated houses, then the artists are only doing good to this local community and the appearance of the block. In Irkutsk the local government hired those “vandals” to paint the long grey fence in the centre of the town, so people won’t have to look at that depressingly boring wall while going to the central square, university or any other significant place located near the bank of Angara. And now the whole town is proud of this fence, even the most conservative members of this community think that it is, for sure, a work of art.  
Graffiti is just another form of self-expression, a form that requires skills, time and, even nowadays, a certain amount of risk. Graffiti can be a form of a social protest, a cry for justice. Poems without meter and rhyme are still considered literature. Paintings that do not need canvases should still be considered art.
