Report on the Conference
On 5.12.2011 there was a conference regarding the incoming academic payment to our department. The payment consists of one million Euro, and we have two academic years to spend it on our needs.
It has been decided that we should go for one more payment by using the current one not only for our needs as current freshmen, but also for the next 'generation'. Thus, we are going to use the money wisely, providing with it only department-wise projects.
the way we chose appropriate ways of spending  money : we  an idea, explained it's pluses and minuses,  "point overall" is it valid for the whole goal of the payment or not.
The minutes of the discussin are  following:
1. Help financially students who carry out some researches
2. Invite foreign specialists (new knowledge + advertisement)
3. Dealing experience between students from different departments (place, materials, organizers)
4. Projects between different foreign Universities (language practice)
5. Exchange programs
6. Practice given by our University (e.g. field linguistics)
7. Extra classes (student help institution)
8. A job fair (finding out information about career opportunities)
9. Buying books for the studies
10. Provide everyone with pocket book
11. Food supply; restroom
12. Cultural organisations (theatre, concerts, scientific occasions) 
As  result we have decided to include the following points into our plan: 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11.
Such choice has been made because of lack of money provided from the university and students showing high interest in all the named.
