Recommendations:	My advices for those who want to try herbal medicine 
are the following:
- it is a good idea to hire a herbalist to make a special mix of plants only for you. That is because our organism is a very complicated system and it might turn out that it is completely still to some kinds of plants and vice versa.  
- you should definitely notify your doctor that you are using herbal medicine. This will help him to make prescriptions for you in the future. 
- don't believe the information you find on the packaging of a herbal product, you should always consult with a specialist.
