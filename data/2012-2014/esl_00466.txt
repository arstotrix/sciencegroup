                      Are good communicators born or not?
I think you can not answer for this question just "no" or "yes". Of course, you need some talent to be a good communicator. If the nature has made you shy or nerves, it can be difficult for you to communicate easily. But I believe that the most important for communication is perfect understanding of people and their personalities. It usually comes with a big experience of life. You should know a lot. The knowledge can be found everywhere - in books, in travelling, in meeting with interesting and strange people. But all this things you can get only by yourself. If you really want to understand the life, you always can do it. This way you way easily become a good communicator, even if you are bit shy. So my opinion is: natural talent can help, but good communicators are being made by themselves.
