Essay
Some people think that some kinds of sport, which involves of animals is awful and dangerous for its health.
To my mind, games or competitions where animals show their skills is a very interesting and exiting show. Firstly, animals are funny. When people look at them, they unknowingly begin to laugh. Secondly ,in competitions involving animals people earn a lot of money. For example, horse ridings. There are a lot of bookmakers offices where people can place bets on their favourite horses. Moreover, many charities attract people’s attention on problems of our planet by arranging such events.
However, there is another point of view. A lot of people say, that forcing animals to participate in competitions is the greatest mistake of the our humanity. People argue that it is an animal abuse. And our “little brothers” don’t deserve such treatment. For example, there are a lot of cases of the letal outcomes among the animals in circuses. It is the result of the cruel treatment with them.
I partically agree with this point of view.In most cases animals are become aggressive and their handlers should hit them to return a good mood.
In conclusion I would like to say that there is nothing bad in taking animals part in competitions, because of the benefit of it is much more than harm.
