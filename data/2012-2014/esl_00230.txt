Nowadays the majority of local authorities face the problem of rational and efficient spending money on city's needs. They have to understand what is more important: to provide citizens with cheap housing and facilities or to make their city more beautiful and culturally interesting.
The thing is, both two areas are significant for a city. First of all, providing cheap housing and facilities is a necessary part of satisfaction of citizens' needs. It is obvious that there are different classes in each society and government should take care of everybody. Because the middle and low class contribute the major part, it is more important to provide them with not so expensive facilities. 
Spending money on well-designed buildings has other purposes. First of all, it seems not so important and necessary at first glance. People can live without it while without cheap housing it becomes a problem. However, providing the city with architectural unusual buildings plays a significant role in cultural meaning. The thing is, interesting and unique buildings often draw attention of many people, especially tourists. Therefore, even if a considerable amount of budget money is spent on such area, later this money will be compensated by tourists, exhibitions etc. In a whole, it draws public attention much more than just building cheap houses.
In conclusion, I believe that both areas are important for development of a city, although providing inhabitants with housing plays the paramount role.
