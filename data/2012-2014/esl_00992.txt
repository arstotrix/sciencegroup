The success of a company depends on the happiness of its employee
Companies consist of people, and it is people who make profit. And if people work harder, they make greater profit. The question is, if happiness really helps people to work harder. 
On the one hand, people cannot actually work when they are miserable. Everybody knows Maslow`s Pyramid. This theory tells us, that person cannot do some things before he had done some simpler things. For example, person cannot study when he is hungry. I think the same theory applied to work: an employee cannot work unless he is unhappy.
On the other hand, some kinds of happiness could distract people. For example, it is hard sometimes to make work person who is in love. This person would not think about anything but his love. Also, there are some people, like Sherlock Holmes, who actually work better when they are miserable. This unhappiness makes them feel more ready to work, it pulls them forward. In my opinion, it is somewhere deeply in human`s nature. While human is hungry, he is searching for the food, he is working hard to stay alive.
To sum up, I actually prefer to agree with the statement. Of course, there are some people, who work harder being miserable, but vast majority of people does greater success when they are happy. So I would recommend employers to make their employees feel as good, as possible.
