Everybody knows that transport connection is terribly bad in Moscow and Moscow suburb.  And the worst kind of public transport is bus. In fact, sometimes you even can't get your job or university. For example, yesterday I was thirty minutes late for my test on linguistics because three buses had been delayed. The traffic congestion had prevented them from arriving on time. And I want to show why traffic jams arise.
Firstly, for the last several years more and more people have decided to live in little towns rather than in Moscow. There they can afford themselves to buy a bigger and more comfortable flat than in the city. So the quantity of people having estate car have increased too. However, our highways are not expected to be used by so large number of cars. 
Secondly, very often traffic congestions spring up because of blocking highways for some officials who live in their detached houses far from Moscow. Early in the morning If the road is closed for only twenty minutes the tailback will lengthen out for five kilometers.
Thirdly, what about traffic jams in Moscow itself, they are caused by cars parking in the streets. There are few parking places in Moscow so people leave their cars straight on the left side of roads. In the end there is only one line for driving instead of two. 
To sum up, the traffic congestions are the main problem of our transport. The problem is so serious that some people talk about transport collapse in Moscow suburb. I hope our authorities will do something to sort out this problem.
