Children's Dreams and Nightmares: Emerging Trends in Research.
Though analyzing of adultt's dreams has a great success in mostpsychotherapy, there are just few studies about   nature and functions of children's dreams. This research were studied how age and gender differences influence on   recall of dreams, and also how functions and content of children dreams have used tochange with the course of time. 
There are six methods of research of children's dreams: (a) dreams collected in the sleep laboratory from multiple awakenings during consecutive REM periods, (b) most recent dream reports written down by the child, (c) dream tapes recorded by the child, (d) 7-day dream journals completed by the child, (e) a combination of written dream reports supplemented by an interview, and (f) written reports by adults in response to a query about their earliest recalled dream. So, every type of this method characterizes different ways for dreams study. 
There was found one common fact during this research: in every researcher's experiment virtually neither child's dreams had sexuality nor teenagers' dreams , But aggression took place in their dreams Aggression   differs by age and genderAnother finding was nextmoving from childhood to young adulthood in most experiments wereincreases anactive participation in dreams In addition, children had weak recall of their dreams Youngboys had lower recall than  girlYoung boys saw dreams withmale , but girls saw in their dreams boys and girls in equal quantity, in dreams of boys' predominance male.
Although this research gave a lot of useful information, there are not enough studies in this sphere. There is a need in more normative studies of children's and teenager's dreams, including young children, that can be shared and compared.
