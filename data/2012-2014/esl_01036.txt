Is globalization a good thing?
Nowadays we all can observe globalizations affection: number of international companies significantly increased, world wide web contains a huge amount of information that is available almost from the every point of the earth and so forth. But all these consequences are ambiguous. Some people suppose that globalization is what the world needs, others consider it to be harmful and prejudicial.
To my view, despite all the disadvantages that globalization process has, it is still a good thing. Due to globalization education level over the world have noticeably grown, scientists from all countries have got a possibility to work together to get better results, so globalization have a positive impact on scientific and technical progress. Besides that, owing to globalization we have an access to many products from different parts of the world, that are not produced in our own country and now we may get almost everything we need or we want.
Nevertheless, globalization has some negative aspects. For example, some people think that countries that are less developed have less rights on the world market. I can’t object, but on the other hand this phenomenon may have a favorable affect: this gives to such country a stimulus to develop and improve quality of life of citizens.
To conclude, globalization has a few unfavorable aspects that we must fight, but it gives to people many possibilities and things, without which it’s already hard to imagine our life.
