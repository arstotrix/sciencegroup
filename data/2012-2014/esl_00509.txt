Ludwig Wittgenstein: "The limits of my language mean the limits of my world"
It's difficult to interpret unambiguously what Ludwig Wittgenstein wanted to say by that quote. As for me, I can suppose that Wittgenstein intended that language is the main cognitive instrument for people. With language we describe every phenomenon in our life. And if our vocabulary is restricted, we can't analyze the world around us. George Orwell in his novel "1984" raises the same problem. In that novel English is artificially shorted and modified for the purpose of creating the new language (so called Newspeak) that cannot express concepts divergent with the official ideology. It was a very efficacious method to conquer the rebellion.
