Despite the abundance of plagiarism detecting systems working with source code, there are few programs able to work with short pieces of code, such as basic level homework. The goal of the paper is to describe the creation of a system able to find cases of plagiarism in Linguistic students' programming assignments. Some standard changes are often made to obscure a case of plagiarism making the works' source code visually unsimilar, so the main concept of the program is to unify all the pieces of code before the comparison. The work includes the following stages: the list of plagiarized assignments' features is compiled, the methods of comparison of the works are chosen, the structure of the program is worked out. In spite of several security vulnerabilities found, the program has demonstrated a sufficient level of efficiency during the testing. The testing also shows that the results may be affected, for instance, by non-standart renaming of variables, but these vulnerabilities are too specific to be often used by students to dissemble cases of plagiarism. However, in the last section of the paper the ways of elimination of the vulnerabilities are proposed.
