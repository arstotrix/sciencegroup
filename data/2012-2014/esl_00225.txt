The sport is an entertainment that came to us from the ancient Greeks. Since those times every sport event has a competitive nature. However, now money has reached the sport too. An enormous amount of money has been invested in popular sports for many reasons: health care, salaries to sportstars, participation in advertisment or bribing judges. Under such circumstances, can we speak that the sport has kept its competitive nature or the sport is already corrupted by money?
The thing is that now everything depends on money, even sport. Money is an ubiquitous totalizator. In sport it helps to support sportsmen in different spheres. Therefore sport is advertised by money. On billboards, on TV, on the Internet there are adverts containing sportstars. It even does not matter what the product is - Coca-Cola, trainers or perfume. Furthermore, money means cheating of any kind. With the help of money sportsmen can get steroids to increase their physical skills or bribe a referee.
On the other hand, the true nature of the sport is still the same. Each sportsman struggles to reach the top. Only persistent training and desire to reach the goal lead to the top of the Sports Hall of the Fame. While such a glory does not get easily, a sportsman who surrenders to the training completely can achieve a lot. The life of the sportsmen seems to be full of modern romanticism: tours, competitions, championships, meetings, new friends and experience, cups, medals. However, it is the daily work on the brink of physical abilities. Money is expected by many sportsmen, but only reaching their goals, the sportsman feels satisfaction and peace.
Summarising the above, I would like to notice that the more money the sport gains the more it seems to move away from its core values. However, I partly disagree. The whole idea of the sport is compatition. It will not be moved away only because of money. The sport exists until its compatitive nature exists.
