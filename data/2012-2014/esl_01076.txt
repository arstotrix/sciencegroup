Architecture is one of the oldest art forms. It is something that combines all forms of art and artistic creation with human activity in general.
Since ancient times people have tried to protect themselves from the elements of nature. They cost shelters, houses, towns etc. engendering architecture as urban design. Later, when mankind learned to see and understand the beauty, people began to create beautiful works of architecture. Nowadays, a large number of architectural works pleasing to our eyes and hearts. 
The architecture combines sculpture, painting and other spatial and temporal modes of artistic creation. That is why architecture is called "the mother of all arts" and I agree with this statement.
