In modern society education becomes a major issue due to the fact of solving, more or less, other global problems. One of the vital educational problems is learning of foreign languages. It is quite clear that an ability to communicate with people from different countries gives an enormous amount of possibilities. Does it mean that we shall teach our children foreign languages as early as possible?
On the one hand, it is much easier for small children to learn something new. They are curious about everything, eager to learn more about the world that surrounds them. Some researches show that they are quite capable of learning physics and chemistry if teachers don't tell them that it is to difficult for them. It will also help to study other subjects due to the fact that lots of information in science articles and on the web are only available in English.
On the other hand, it's quite a challenge to teach children languages. I had a terrible experience in my primary school cause my teacher couldn't actually teach us properly. It was only to my secondary school teacher that I became capable of reading and writing properly.
