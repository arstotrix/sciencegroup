The bar chart demonstrates an overview of weight assessment found in Newtown in 1950 and 2010. The data itself show how the situations changed over sixty years and how the age of respondents correlates with their weight.
On the example of an age group "60-69" it may be outlined that there was a rapid fall from 50% down to 5% of people who had an appropriate weight and, consequently, the growth of those whose weight is extremelly big. This is how lack of physical activities or bad quality of food may influence people's bodies. Apparently, people are not looking forward to keep fit when they achieve 65, because all such procedures take money and time.
The appearance of the youth with underweight in 2010 can be explained by the popularity of fashion models nowadays. The huge impact on the younger generation was made exactly by the world of fashion that almost every advert is full of. Young girls start to avoid extra calories in order to be like those women in the catalogs.
 In the end, the common tendency shows that a residual number of respondents with ideal weight in 2010 has been a representative category of people in 1950. Furthermore, the critical values as "obese" or "underweight" have been developed only to 2010 though.
