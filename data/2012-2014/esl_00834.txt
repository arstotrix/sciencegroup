The era of the Internet started in the 1990s and today the Internet is the mean that contribute greatly into globalization processes. The Internet offers a number of opportunities that may vary from conducting business affairs to entertainment and education. Because of this multifunctionality the majority of people believe that Internet is the one of the greatest inventions of humankind, although others argue that such a massiveness of the Internet makes it an unreliable resource of gaining data.

The main advantage of the Internet is the fact that lots of operations could be held simultaneously. Moreover, as the global net the Internet provides the enormous amount of information presented in different ways: textual, video and audio content. And what is more important the biggest part of this data can be gained free. Other people are attracted by the Internet because it gives an opportunity to communicate with people all over the words.

However, the Internet has its risks. Because of the idea of anonymity and massiveness all the information posted in the net should be checked twice. Additionally, people on the net behave themselves not as polite as they would do in the real life because they do not put at risk any personal information. Eventually, with the spread of the Internet came the spread of the viruses that do not only affect the way our gadgets work but in some cases blackmails money from those who became its victim.

In conclusion it is crucial to mention that notwithstanding all the drawbacks of the Internet it has some undoubtful pluses, for example, speed. Unfortunately, today humankind does not have any alternatives to the Internet that is why the number of those who use it practically always will increase.
