     Moscow, Russia - first impressions
   Me and my husband, Gilbert, arrived here only 2 days ago - but how much we managed to experience! I can't really describe everything, but stay away from Moscow! You may see some positive comments further in the blog, though they're all cooked up.
   The prices here are incredibly high. All you can expect from service in shops is that the change you get will be counted correctly.  The city is extremely dirty. Dumps burn everywhere! 
   The police here is apathetic. The amount of pickpocketing is looming large. Romany nick bags with knifes and take the lining. First day of our arrival we'll remember as a day of the first unforgettable incident.
   Yesterday morning we stopped by a caf√© to have a breakfast. The portions were so small and the food was so disgusting! But now we know why Americans are often so obese. A buffet luncheon in America is equal to a breakfast and dinner in Russia. 
   Today we decided to walk into Red Square and immediately ran into a huge crowd of insane superannuated communists, who were vociferating old hymn, waving flags with hammer and sickle. 
   In Moscow everything is sizable. Buildings, roads, everything! The central street has 20 lanes. 20!!! It's extremely difficult to move by car. You can cover small distances for a long time. Traffic jams take place for the whole week. Trying to cross the road is much alike playing Russian roulette. You risk being overridden strait  on a "zebra", so you'd better find the nearest traffic light or underground passage. 
   Tomorrow we're going to visit Kremlin, citadel of Moscow in which the Russian government is housed. Hope to be satisfied and remain unhurt with all the misfortunes we face. I'll surely comment on it in my next blog.
