It seems that globalisation is an inevitable process and attitude toward it is really different. Is the impact of globalisation good or bad?
I think that the globalisation is normal tendency just because it looks like the natural course of events. An invention of the electricity, of the internet, the start of the exploration of the space undoubtedly should lead to the blurring of the frontiers between the states. Globalisation is a great opportunity for people from Third World countries to get an education and a job and take themselves out of poverty. Also globalisation is a phenomenon that helps people of the all world to communicate and it means that progress can be shared and extended.
However, one shouldn’t forget that the globalisation causes such important problems of humanity like famine, global warming, etc. People of poor countries can get the job, but they’re payed much less than native citizens and treated really terrible. 
But with great power comes great responsibility and I think that all the problems will be solved if the government of rich countries claim a policy aimed at peace in the world and prosperity of it.
