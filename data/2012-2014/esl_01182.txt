Dear Olga Ilyinichna,

I may be putting you out with my request, but would you possibly be able to write me a letter of reference for the application to the Berkeley Linguistics Graduate Program. 
My name is Sonya Burdukova , and I am a Junior majoring in Linguistics. I took your course in fall of 2014 and finished with an A in the class. I will be applying for a position on Dr. Pitt's linguistic research team at University of California. Dr. Pitt's is a leading expert in the field of modern and medieval languages, I believe that his team's research in a foreign culture could bring great advances to me and my future career, and the application is due by December 16.
While I was in your class, I became curious about our most crucially human attribute, language. I am sure that this subject combines the arts and sciences appealing and I consider that language per se is similar to science-fiction. Therefore I would very much like to be part of a team that is working on something so important and I suppose that research in modern and medieval languages is crucial nowadays. If you are willing to write me a letter of reference, please let me know and I will provide my personal statement, CV and all required material that you would like. Also I would be more than happy to meet with you at your convenience if that would be helpful. If you don’t feel comfortable writing me a letter of reference, please don’t feel obligated to say yes. I completely understand.
Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I realize that writing a letter of reference would be a burden on your time and it means a lot to me that you would take the time to read and consider my request.

All the best,
Sonya Burdukova
