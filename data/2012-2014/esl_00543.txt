This chart shows  us different people's preferences concerning some places to go at leisure.
There are 3 groups of people: born in Australia, migrants born in English-speaking countries and migrants from other countries. Also,  time we have 4 types of places to go: zoo, library, theatre and cinema. 
I' m going to view each place one after another. 
The first entertaining thing is a zoo. On its diagram we see that new migrants speaking English hold the highest position. On the second are natives of Australia and on the third are migrants from other countries. 
The second diagram (library) shows us that the primal position hold migrants from other countries. 
As we can see on the third diagram a theatre is not very popular for anybody. 
And finally, cinema is the most visited place especially for those who was born in Australia.
In my opinion, these chart shows us full well which place is a favorite among all types of people. Cinema.
And this is clear, because everybody want to relax, to have some fun and to shrink from the ordinary life and troubles. That's why the choose cinema and consider it as the best way to take a break.
