The both graphs show the weight evaluation of five age-groups of people who live in Newtown. The first one describes data from the year 2010 and the second one gives the results of the survey in 1950. 
The most dramatic changes can be observed concerning the oldest group of Newtown inhabitants. The percentage of obese elderly persons had grown since 1950. The percentage of overweight Newtown dwellers had also risen by 2010. Correspondingly the number of underweight people had shown a significant decline since the beginning of this period. For the youngest age-group the changes are less noticeable. The percentage of youngsters with ideal weight had seen just slight drop by the end of these six decades.
The number of obese people has risen in all five age-groups.  The most fatal increase can be noticed for the two last groups. The percentage has grown from just ten percent to more than half for age range 50-59, and from five percent to sixty for the age-group 60-69. The average number of people with ideal weight in 1950 was about sixty percent and by 2010 this percentage had fallen by about twenty percent.
