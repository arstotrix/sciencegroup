The bar chart shows the correlation between weight assessments in different age groups of inhabitants of Newtown in 1950 and 2010.
We can see that percentage of ideal weight of the fifth group dramatically fell from 50 per cent to 5 per cent between 1950 and 2010. 
A more detailed look at the chart reveals that there haven't been people with obese weight in age groups 20-29 and 30-39 in 1950. In contrast in 2010 in both of these age groups we have steady growth of percentage of people with obese weight. According to the chart, the same thing happened with overweight people aged 20-29. In fact, in 1950 percentage of people with underweight weight in every age group had been more than 15 per cents. However in 2010 the minimum of people in the same category in all age groups was 1 per cent.  
Clearly, the minimum of people with ideal weight in 1950 was just under 50 per cent and in 2010 the minimum of people in the same category was just under 5 per cent.
