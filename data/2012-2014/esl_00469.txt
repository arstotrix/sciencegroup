                       The speech for the opening of a new building.
Dear ladies and gentlemen! I am happy to talk to you. Today is a very important day for all of us. We celebrate an opening of a new building. But I think you understand that not only this wonderful new building makes us so happy. We can hope that new life of our town will begin with it. Nothing had been making us proud for a long time. When tourists were coming to our hometown, we had nothing interesting to show them. But now everything has changed. We understand that our small town can be like other famous places of our country. This new building will make it popular all over the world. Wait, wait! Stop your clapping, please! I know, you are enjoying my speech, but let me say some more words. This fame will help us to build our modern progressive society like this building. So we will go very quickly by the way of liberty and democracy.
