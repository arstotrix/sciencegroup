Mistakes in comparatives in heritage texts
According to the way of acquiring the language, there are different types of the speakers: the native speakers, the heritage speakers (the migrants whose mother tongue was affected by the language of the other country) and the language learners. The speakers of all three types make mistakes in their oral and written performances. It is important to study mistakes because they are the source of knowledge on the mechanisms language works in brain. In this work we concentrate our attention on the Russian heritage speakers' mistakes. 
 The research on heritage mistakes has already been done by linguists such as M. Polinsky and O. Kagan (see e.g. [Polinsky & Kagan, 2007]) who studied case paradigms, quantifier placement, filler-gap dependencies etc. Still, their research was based on single examples, while we are working within the corpus approach. 
In my course paper I focus on the comparative constructions. The purpose of the course paper as a part of the heritage project is to classify comparative constructions in heritage texts from the Corpus of Heritage Russian, to investigate what types of these constructions are the most complicated to use for the heritage speakers and to understand what parts of the constructions are particularly prone to be affected by mistakes.
