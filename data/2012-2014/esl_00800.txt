Internet technologies have opened many doors in working area. Today having a job outside the workplace does not seem odd. On the contrary, the number of people working at home is increasing. However, this tendency may have its pluses and minuses.
One of the crucial advantages of working remotely is flexibility to arrange your work hours during the day. It is much more convenient to work in a familiar atmosphere where you may regulate your environment from lighting to the mood. 
What is more, you do not have to waste your time in traffic congestions; and also most women spend a lot of time tidying themselves up, so working at home helps to save the precious time too. 
Moreover, staying at home for work allows you to keep the balance between work and family. Thus, this proximity to home and family is extremely important to mothers of little children. And finally, working remotely is less stressful in many ways such as, for instance, absence of conflicts with colleagues.
On the other hand, having a job at home has some drawbacks. First of all, there are many interruptions at home that could be sometimes quite disruptive that cannot help affecting the working process. Furthermore, some people seem to be easily distracted by relaxed atmosphere and lack for self-discipline. That is why it is tough for them to concentrate while working outside the workplace.
Further on, those who work from home often need something for inspiration. For example, they are isolated from professionals in the same area and it is difficult to stay in touch with them, to exchange with your own experience. 
To sum it up, working outside the workplace has several strength and weaknesses. While it gives you freedom in planning your life, it also puts to the test your self-discipline.
