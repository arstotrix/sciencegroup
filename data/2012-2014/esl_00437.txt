6. Is lying ever permissible?
Do you really want to be a person for whom the lie is giving regularly?
I think that the majority of the people will answer that they prefer to know truth. Nevertheless the part of people expresses the ability to except lie and accept  it.  The reality is that we are living in the society where we can see the lie since the birth till death. Our surrounding permits to lie and does not block it on the first stages. The person adherences the live situations and allows him/herself to act according to it.
Why the child begins to lie to his parents? I was the observer of the situation when the young brother of my friend came to his parents and said that he had broken his bicycle. The parents reacted emotionally and made the young boy guilty in situation which had happened. In the reality the boy was not guilty. The bicycle has been broken due to an accident which had had occurred in the yard. The parents did not understand the issue completely. They possible provoked the feeling that truth has not been found out and has not been accepted. The second time there would not be any reason for young boy to describe the complete situation.
Analyzing this point, I can only emphasize that sometimes we ourselves gives the prepositions for lie.
From another point, by our nature we would like to know truth. We would prefer to understand the real positions of the person and his views even if we do not accept it. We need the truth for improvement and development. I would prefer to know if my cookies are tasty or not. Imagine, you say that cookies are tasty, but in reality you could not eat even one. On the other hand, you say the truth and help the person to develop skills of cooking. 
I have developed the understanding that it is the choice of each person to tell or not to tell truth or lie. The live gives us the experience based on which the conclusion is made .Even thought the society admits the lie and thus the lie is permissible.
