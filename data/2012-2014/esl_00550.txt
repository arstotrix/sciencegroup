The two pie charts contain the information about benefits and drawbacks of Fairmont Island. From the first one we can conclude that the main thing visitors claimed to dislike about is high cost of living there. Besides, about a third of respondents named entertainment (or absence of that) chief disadvantage. Yet a fifth of them mentioned weather.
Another graph reports us that the scenery and the people are the chief wealth of the island. And only one tenth of visitors named culture as plus points, and so much mentioned good accommodation.
These graphs being observed, we deduce that in spite of so expensive living conditions, unpleasant weather and lacking of fun, people are willing to pay much money to enjoy picturesque sight ant to be in a good setting. Therefore, we have conclusion that there are two main reasons which make people choose this island - they are landscape and men.
