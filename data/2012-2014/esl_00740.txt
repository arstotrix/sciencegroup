Nowadays every part of our life full of diff–µrent gadgets that make it be easier. However, there are people who claim that modern technologies have a great influence on humanity.

	Without doubts, there are several disadvantages, but  there also appears a huge number of benefits. 
In my view, there are three real ways that might make humanity suffer from using technology. First of all, a lot of people are dependent on gadgets and can't live own life without them. Every type of dependence is dangerous for community and bad for person's health, especially moral. Secondly, radio waves that are invisible and untouchable affect person's health too. Scientists still argue about this possible problem all over the world. And finally, some people afraid that artificial intellect can raise one day and make all people be slaves. For last couple of years, lots of films about this topic were created, for example, very popular "Terminator" and not so famous "Iris", that was named as well-known spelled backward "Siri", smart iPhone's manager.
Despite all the pointed disadvantages, I'm still sure that creating modern technology is a great step forward for all humanity and the Earth. Technology allows us to read books and magazines without destroying forests. Readers are a great way to save resources and money, not buying magazines all the time, but just buying subscription once a year. Tablets are very portable and give a chance to do necessary things without wasting time at any place and any time. Besides, technology are using for regulations on the city's roads making them without traffic jumps.
All in all, each disadvantage has no real ground. People adore imagining some problems. However, it's not true for technology-dependence, but also the main problem of this situation is a weak person not a gadget. Modern technologies change our ordinary life significantly. In order to get benefits from this, people should use them in a right way, not overusing.
