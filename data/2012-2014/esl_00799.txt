Nowadays, there is more and more technology inside our houses. This is certainly a positive aspect of 21st century life and one of the most beneficial modern inventions.
Thanks to technology our lives have become easier - if we need to conduct research for school we do not even have to leave our houses, because we can get all the necessary information on our computers whenever and wherever we want, without paying and using the wifi connection already free almost everywhere.
In addition, there are lots of positive aspects of using the Internet: if we need to pay a fee and we do not have time to go to the bank, we can always do this through our bank account fast and securely.
We can also cook faster thanks to the invention of the microwave and oven or to watch a football match live on TV. 
In my opinion, being too reliant on technology is not a risk for getting basic skills.
In fact, technology is only helping us and it simplified our life. For example, even if this get more time, we can directly go to the bank to pay a fee or conduct research without using technology: there are many libraries where we can easily consult useful materials for research.
However, we should try to change our habits and try to use technology only when it is necessary because it can lead to a sedentary life and a limited social life.
