Nowadays we face with graffiti more and more often, it has become a typical attribute of all modern cities. Some people claim that graffiti is a kind of vandalism, while others still belive, that itâ€™s a new form of art. 
Personaly I consider that at first, we should define what we call a graffity. Paintings of graffitiers vary: some of them are really worth calling a masterpiece, while others we can compare with hand-writing paintings on a fence. From this view, I agree, that the first type is an art. It has become a modern way for many teenagers and adults to express their feelings, to say something new to society, develop the art. It is an opportunity to create a wonderful things. Unfortunately, in our country this kind of art is not supported and for many people graffiti is still a strange and unprofessional paintings of teenagers on a fence. I know that for example, in New York a special regions exist for graffiti-painters, where they can draw on huge walls. In such places making a graffiti has become an art and paintings surprise viewers. However, there are a lot of paintings which used to call graffiti, but which can not be considered as art. For example, some paintings or scripts without censorship. I agree that most of them are likely to be a sort of vandalism. 
To sum it up, graffiti may be both a branch of modern art and an act of vandalism. It depends on the painter, painting and the place, where it is drawn.
