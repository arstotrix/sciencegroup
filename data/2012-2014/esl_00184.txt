The spirit of sporting competition has been destroyed by the amount of money now associated with most sports.While milliards of people around the world keep watching their favorite sport games, making bets and celebrating the victories of their favoriteteams or sportsmen, skeptics are concerned about the eliminating of the competition spirit by the amount of money associated with most sportsnowadays.The first thing we need to understand about this problem is whether we are applying it to the audience of any sport competition or directly tothe participants. If we are talking about sports fans, the situation is not worth any concern at all: the amount of money spent on sportsdoesn't influence fan's passion and heat. However, if we think in the same manner about the participants of sports competitions, we can see thatnowadays, motivated by money and not by the sheer excitement of victory, sportsmen become more of performers. And while it may not seem aproblem at all, there is another side: nowadays the success of many teams changes in direct proportion to the profitable cash investments. Let'stake football clubs, for instance.  It is not a rare occasion today when a football club buys foreign players, who may be better than any playerin our country, but still are foreigners.  Does it make the level of patriotism decrease? There is no direct evidence, but it is also very easyto believe that.Our opinion does not make any difference, though. Nowadays a professional sportsman is, just like any other job, connected with money. And thereis no doubt sportsmen expect to be paid for what they are doing. If you want to experience the sheer spirit of sporting competition and for somereason cannot find it watching the professional games, you can always go to the yard and watch children play.
