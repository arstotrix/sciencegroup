Unit 8. Student book.

20th century was extremely important and efficient in the development of space and although today there is no many breakthroughs and significant results in this field, mankind continues exploring the space. 
New businessmen believe that space tourism is the major task nowadays and it helps in exploration the space, however, I disagree with them. From my point of view, entrepreneurs have only one reason to push forward ideas about space tourism and this reason calls money. I do not believe they do interest in the development of space exploration. I read some articles about influential people, who payed an enormous amount of money to rise up in space and see our planet from the spacecraft. Only very rich people can afford to make such a "trip", but how it helps to develop the space?! Furthermore,  how we can call it a tourism? For today it is a luxury, not an opportunity for everyone. It is undoubtedly profitable for businessmen who funded in this project, but in fact except for the money for founders it brings nothing. The problem is we do not know much about space itself, our universal or life on the other planets and the projects devoted to such issues are not developing and are not supported financially. As far as I know, the last attempts of our government to launch the satellites and rockets ended unsuccessfuly. I believe that new generation of entrepreneurs would focus their attention on the projects of space investigations, instead of searching for benefits for themselves. 
To sum it up, I am not support the opinion of businessmen to invest money in space tourism, as it is not effective in developing of space exploration.
