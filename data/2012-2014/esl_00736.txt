Nowadays it is not necessary to teach subjects that improve person’s creative abilities at schools. Unfortunately, this is the main reason why some pupils are not so great at schools and life in the whole.
First of all, such subjects as drama, arts, music and craft help children and teenagers to improve creative thinking, performances and handmade skills. The acquirements can be necessary in usual adult life in order to make it easier, brighter and just more fun. Secondly, such arts-based subjects give a chance to pupils to improve their talents that they already have at school place without any extra courses somewhere else. 
More than that, in the case if person has a calling for creative existence, such lessons help to define future profession and prepare carefully for exams at university. Besides, going on these lessons, everybody will feel team spirit and get such brilliant social skills as good-fellowship and cheerfulness that, doubtlessly, will help to feel confident and have a success in everyday life and society. 
For the last reason why the subjects should be compulsory in the secondary school, they are not only about acquire different useful skills, they also about doing everything with pleasure and just have fun. Every pupil is very sensitive and may have a big number of stressful situations during adolescent time. So the arts-based lessons can be a latent psychotherapy, rendering an assistance and supporting when pupils may need maintenance. Besides, participating in such practice, they have a chance to have a temporal rest from difficult subjects as math, chemistry and so on.
To conclude, all types of arts are always have a great influence on humanity. And I am totally sure that it would be a marvelous opportunity if they had become an essential part of everyone’s life.
