The table illustrates how many children were born to Australian women at the age from  40 to 44 years between 1981 and 2006, a period of 25 years.
Overall, the amount of women who give birth to three or more children declines over the period, and the number of those who have two children, one or haven’t at all rises.
In 1981 there were 27.6 percent of women with four or more children and in 2006 only 11. So the quantity of women having many children drops sharply. The number of mothers with three children gets lower at a steady rate 5.9 percent for 25 years. In sharp contrast to this, the percent of mothers of two children grows gradually and they keep getting the highest position all 25 years. The amount of families with one child also becomes higher on 5.6 percent. Finally, more and more women decide not to have child at all – 8.5 percent in 1981 versus 15.9 in 2006.
