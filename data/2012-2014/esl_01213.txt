Educational system based on curriculi and standardized testing is proven by time to work reasonably good however many people argue that it has great amount of flaws. I can agree that such system is in many cases ineffective and even sometimes harmful.
The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that studying is often aimed at having good grades at exams and getting a diploma. Students are not encouraged to go beyond a curriculum, to search for new information by themselves. They don’t learn how discover anything new and they don’t have any interest in doing that.
Another problem might be that curriculi are changed not as often as they should be. Methods and learning materials can become seriously dated. New technologies that can improve educational process are not introduced.
Rules in every aspect of life are important and keep our world in order but having strict borders in education isn’t such a good thing. Of course rules can be the basis for our knowledge but they shouldn’t be the limit for students’ discoveries. 
Standardized tests are useful for understanding your level and being a part of global community but students shouldn’t be taught to thing that passing them is the main goal of studying or that failing at a test is the end of the world. Young people need to understand what their passions are and be able to follow them. It is important for them to be taught critical thinking and to be creative.
