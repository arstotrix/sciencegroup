Despite that the acculturation studies have begun about  hundred years ago, nowadays the psychology of acculturation is still on the top of researchers due to  growing up number of immigrants in many countries.  Acculturation is a result of intercultural contact. It is associated with changes in being in contact cultures at the cultural level and with behavioral changes at the individual level.  Canadian psychologist J.W. Berry proposed that positive and negative orientations to maintaining heritage culture and to contact with a host society could be combined in four different acculturation strategies: integration, separation, assimilation and marginalisation. Integration is when individuals choose the identification with both cultures. Separation means the identification only with heritage country's culture. When individuals identify with host country's culture and do not accept to heritage culture, there is assimilation. Marginalisation means the rejection of both cultures. These four strategies lead to different psychological consequences. Integration is the most preferable strategy of acculturation, marginalisation is the least preferable. However, under what circumstances individuals prefer one or another acculturation strategy is not  clear. It was found that there is an influence of social and political context on the acculturation process. Therefore, in the future research we will examine a hypothesis of the impact of different educational institutions to the acculturation process of immigrants.
