 The spreadsheet describes the proportion of children born alive to women aged 40-44 years in Australia in the periods 1981, 1986, 1996 and 2006 years with detailed information on the unborn children, alive child, two and three children, four or more children changing from year to year. 

 It is reported that in 1981 the percentage of unborn children and born child was 8.5 percent and 7.6 percent, the stake of two, three, four and more children accounted for 29.0, 27.4 and 27.6 percent. After 5 years data in 1986 changed so the share of unborn children and one child  has increased by 1.2 and by 1.1 percent, the stake of the two children grew by 6.6 percent, the proportion of three and four or more children decreased by 0.4 and by 8.7 percent.

 Subsequent periods constituting the majority of years of statistical study shows a steady enlargement and reduction in the number of born and unborn children in percent. From 1996 to 2006, the share of unborn children and alive child enlarged from 12.8 and 11.3 percent to 15.9 and 13.2 percent, the stake of two kids increased from 38.2 to 0.1 percent, while the share of three, four or more children decreased from 24.6 and to 13.1 percent to 21.5 and 11.0 percent.

 From the above data, we can conclude that the share of unborn children, one alive child and two children for women aged 40-44 years in Australia was steadily increased and the stake of three, four and more children have constantly declined.
