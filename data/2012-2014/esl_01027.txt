When you start talking about globalization first thing you might be talking about different definitions of this word. There are different topics where the word “globalization” can ﬁt in, such as politics, economy, culture and so on.  As it is written in the dictionary globalization is a process of global economical, political and cultural integration.
There are some positive and negative consequences of globalization. At first I want to consider the positive effects of globalization process. One of the most visible effects is the improved quality of products due to global competition. It is good not only for the consumers, but for producers too, because demand for the products grow.
But there are some negative effects. For example, destruction of the national sovereignty of the country which were the main characters of the international relations throughout many centuries. In my opinion, it is a negative effect because it badly influences culture of the country.
To conclude I wanted to say that whatever globalization is good or not, this process is occurs today and we can hardly do something with it.
