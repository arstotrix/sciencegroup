The global transport system and transport itself should be changed and reformed, because the amount of people and cars increases every day, so transport system doesn't answer the necessities of citizens.
I have several thoughts about how transport system will look in future. May be even in ten years we will see cardinal changes. To my mind people will have much more roads, interchanges and bridges. People will be needed soil only for residential buildings and roads. But roads won't be simple, as now. They will be with special surface that will not be dangerous for nature, furthermore, it will help to improve it. It also will be for cars without wheels, such kind of roads will help cars to fly above it and not to fall. The system of toll highways will be developed more. In addition, the term 'traffic jams' will not exist. Such problem will be solved in special organization that will control the transport system all over the world. People will also use alternative fuel like electricity, we have already stated to use it, but in future there will be no fuel for automobiles except electricity.
Automobile itself will differ from the one in present, it will be like those cars in futuristic movies. Moreover, car will be some kind of a robot that will help a driver to certainly drive and even chat. Fortunately, the death rate on the roads will go down, because of the well co-ordinated work of the system. It will be better if traffic policemen substituted for machines, robots so the corruption will be ruled out.
All things considered I would like to say that transport will be waiting for changes nevertheless and it will be turned into something separate like, for example economical market.
