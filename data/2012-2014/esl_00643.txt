In my opinion combining students with different abilities is better for schools. It follows from the point of view that all the students are equal. Undoubtedly, their communication is going to influence their beliefs or interests. Students with different abilities can look up to those who have another thinking that someday they will be like them. This is simple variety. They receive the possibility to experience new feelings and to know something new that they have never knew before.

Although, some might suppose that people with different abilities do not fit the learning process with those who have another abilities. Arguing that the level of education can be lower then. Not only this is the reason. Of course they can easily change their preferences and dream of doing something else while talking to students with dissimilar abilities.

I believe that it is not true.The question that is worth discussin is how to improve the learning process when doing that. For example creating special classes for both levels of abilities. The fact that some subjects are better to be taught to the students of the same level and interests is beyond question. This makes the learning process logical and effective.  

In conclusion, there is always should be the choise and possibility to see something different. In order to decide, compare and analyse. It is hard to live in the world without any diversity. It makes the person stuck and not develop further. We should not stand against natural processes that happend between students and people in general.
