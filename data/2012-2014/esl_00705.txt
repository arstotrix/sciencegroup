Some people are of the opinion that studying a foreign language should begin at primary school, while others consider that this discipline must take place only at secondary school.
I am supporting the opinion of foreign language programms provided at primary schools and there are some arguments supporting this point of view. For example, it is a well-known fact that studying languages goes easier if you begin as early as possible, because the speed of learning the information is much higher in early childhood and it falls down during our whole life because of some physiological features of human body. In the childhood our brains is still open for new facts, information, semiotic systems and ready to study all the time. Moreover, the earlier you begin to learn a foreign langage, the more you will know by the end of school.
On the other hand, there is a wide-broaded opinion that children at primary schools are just not ready enough for such a difficult process. They don't know a lot about their mother-tongue, so it must be very challenging to explain some rules, expressions or grammar of the language they see first time. And if they don't understand such important basics of a new language, so what is the point to full their young heads with difficult and, sometimes, unnecessary material?
To my mind, the argument above makes sense, but I am still of the opinion of studying languages at primary schools. there is no need to teach them difficult grammar or structure of sentences. The process of studying will be more productive if they begin with learning new vocabulary, as it will help the children a lot in the future. Moreover, I consider that the new teaching programms should be discuss in order to make the process of studying more efficient and captivating.
