Hi everyone! Sorry for not writing, i was busy working on my book, and I finally found appropriate title for my book: «Madwoman in Attic», what do you think about it? So, now ghost will live not on the top floor, but attic. Here’s a spoiler: a hero hears footsteps from somewhere above him, he goes to an attic and suddenly sees a young girl. I still don’t know what will happen next, maybe i will tell you next blog.
I’ve just finished Chapter 5 and I finally decided that hero name will be Peter Youngblood. Next, he is going to find out who is the houses architect,so if he will understand something about houses built it may clear the situation. If architects isn’t bound with it, he still needs someone who knows about the ghost. May be the person who sold the house will help him, or it is too easy? what do you think? Publishers were very kind and let me to delay draft submitting and I am very happy because chapter 1 and 2 deadline deadline now is February.
