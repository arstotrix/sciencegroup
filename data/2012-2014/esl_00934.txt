Language is organized hierarchically and people don't always speak the same way, some people speak differently from other people. This fact can be explained with the help of experiments that show the difference between native speakers, heritage speakers, and advanced L2 speakers. We can compare the two grammar types: finite state grammer and phrase structure grammar. Studies have shown that violations in the finite state and violations of hierarchical structure evoke different parts of the brain. Language is full of ambiguity which we can see,for instance, in the sentence,  ‘four cats and dogs’.
 It is well known that a verb in a sentence can agree on person, number, and gender. These three main categories are not created equal, they are organized hierarchically. Person agreement is privileged, because we can see it only on verbs.  Agreement on person is opposed to agreement on number and gender. What linguists see in production is that people make more number and gender errors that they make person errors, therefore people are much more sensitive to person mismatches than they are to number and gender mismatches. Another important fact is that the frequency of the feature doesn’t matter. There are certain hierarchical features in language.
There are two types of opposotions: single-valued, where two elements are opposed by a single feature that can only be present or not, and multi-valued, where every element has the character of their own. Actually, each of those has its own rationality, and both of those come with the cost. Conducted experiments illustrate that if a person, for example heritage speaker, doesn’t remember some rule in language hierarchy, then he or she can reconstruct only points that stands at the start of this hierarchy.
