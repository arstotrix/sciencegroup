Sorry, I haven't written because I've been very busy. Good news! I have decided on the title. It will be « The Madwoman in the Attic». What do you think? Now the ghost is not on the top floor but in the attic. The hero hears footsteps above him and goes to the attic, he sees a young girl. Actually, I don't know what happens next, but I will tell you in my next blog. 
I've finished Chapter 5. The hero's name is Peter Youngblood, he is an architect, so he understands how houses are built. He needs someone who knows about the ghosts and maybe it could be the person who sold the house. Is it too easy? What do you think? The publishers are happy with Chapters 1 and 2, the deadline is now February and now I am a lot happier.
