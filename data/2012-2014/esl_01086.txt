The data what we can see in the given table shows the number of children born to 40-44 years old women in Australia for 4 different years. The number of women from 40- 44 years old who had either one child or none, increased over time while this number decreased for the women of same age group who had two or more children.

In 1981, the number of women in 40-44 years age group who has no children was 8.5% and in 1986 this percentage increased to 9.7%. As we can see, the women of the same age group with one child were 7.6% in 1981 and reached to 8.7% 5 years later. The percentages of women who fall in the same age category with four and more children were much higher, about 28%.    

In 1996 and 2006 the percentage reached to more than 15% for childless women while it reached to 13% for women with 1 child. The percentage of women with 2 children had very little change while the percentage for three of four children decreased over time.

In summary, the women from 40-44 years old had more children initially and this percentage decreased in process time.
