Syllable division in Russian is a problematic and complicated issue. Since Russian belongs to the languages where acoustic signals of the syllable boundaries are not expressed, syllabification of intervocalic consonant clusters is vague. Experiments where native speakers split words into syllables intuitively give controversial results. The theories of syllabification for Russian language based on different criteria are unable to explain all the cases when ambiguity and diversity occur. Therefore, there is a need for another more precise and objective method of data collection that would show how syllables are structured in speaker's thought.
The purpose of this course paper is to determine, how certain intervocalic consonant clusters are divided by native Russian speakers into syllables unconsciously, namely when syllable transpositions in disyllable words are applied. These consonant groups were chosen on the basis of the contradictions that the theories and speakers' answers imply and present following clusters: [str], [ftr], [Ê¨k], [kt], [pk], [mn] and [rl]. In addition, this course paper seeks to discover correlations between the syllable boundary and the age group informants belong to, on the one side, and phonetic features of the word, such as stress position and structure of the second syllable (open or closed syllable), on the other side. Finally, it will provide researchers with experimental data that may be useful for further studies.
