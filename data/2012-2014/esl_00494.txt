Some people don't like the introduction of money and business into sport and feel nostalgic for the time when the sportsmen were amateurs. They are assured that money have depraved the sport.  They assert that nowadays the sport does not embody values such as fair-play, respect for the opponent, and devotion to the team. Moreover, some people affirm that top sportsmen and women are paid too much.
A as an argument they say that sportsmen earn more than doctors, fire-fighters and teachers, who do more for the society's good. But this is a disputable issue because the sportsmen provide millions of people with entertainment . 
As for me, I am sure that the sportsmen deserve their revenues. Today the sport became more spectacular than 100 years ago and the sportsman have to work hardly to answer the requirements of the public and to get on in sport. He stints oneself in everything since childhood and I think he must be recompensed for his toil. 
I suppose that huge salaries of top sportsmen excite the envy of ordinary people that's why there are a lot of talks about it.
The sportsmen are also reproached for a negative example that they set for the young people, but this is not a topic of our discussion.
To sum it up, athletes delight millions of viewers around the world, risking their health, and they deserve their earnings.
