One of the main advantages of literature is its relevance no matter what century is now. This feature mostly refers to classical works of literature. So, why does it remain relevant even after hundreds of years? In my opinion, the answer to that question is that some things stay the same through years as it takes them quite much time to change. One of such things is one's feelings. It doesn't matter whether a person lives in ancient times in Rome or in the 21st century in Russia he still has some affections and fears, he still can love or hope or be desperate and sad. One of such examples is Jerome Salinger's novel "Catcher in the Rye". Though it was written 60 years ago it still reflects teenagers's feeling. And  young people nowadays have thoughts, anxieties and world-views quiye like those Holden Caulfield had.
Another thing that changes very slowly throughout the history is the spirit, and especially the spiri of the folk. Here we can remember Alexander Pushkin's "Eugene Onegin" which is sometimes called the encyclopaedia of Russian life. Though it describes the period which took place about two hundred years ago it still reproduces the pecularities of a mysterious Russian soul. It is sometimes said that the best way to understand it for a foreigner is to read this novel in the original.
Besides, some models of human behaviour don't change through centuries. The above-mentioned "Eugene Onegin"'s main character was described as "the odd man" which was impossible to meet in some historical periods. On the other hand, the main character of Ivan Goncharov's "Oblomov" represents a type of people which has always existed. A lonely recluse spending most of his time in dreaming could be found both in the ancient times and nowadays.
Therefore, we can summarize the reason of relevance of literature. No changes around can change some sides of the human nature. Despite the time,  the country and the customs surrounding a person something nevertheless remains the same.
