I am sorry, I haven’t written a lot these days. But I was really very busy. I have a good News! I have decided to tittle “Madwoman in Attic”. What do you thing about it? Now the ghost is not on the top floor but in the attic. The hero hears footsteps above him. He goes to attic and sees a young girl. I don’t know what happens next but I will tell you in my next blog.

I have finish Chapter 5.The name of the hero is Peter Youngblood and he is an architect so he understands how houses are built. He need someone who knows about the ghost. Maybe it could be the person who sold the house? Is it too easy? What do you thing?

The publishers are happy with Chapters 1 and 2. The deadline is now February. I am now a lot happier.
