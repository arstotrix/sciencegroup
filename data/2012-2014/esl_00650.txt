The table provides information about how many students, from where and of which sex had enrolled at Bristol University in 1928, 1958 and 2008.
As it can be seen on the teble, the overall number of students enrolled had only been increasing from 218 in 1928 through 1,046 and 1958 finally had got 
its peak in 2008 in number of 6,377. It is obvious, because nowadays more people want to get a Bachelors degree and conditions for that are more
 pleasant than in the past.
 What is interesting to mention is that in 2008 the percentage of girls enrolled first time ever prevailed those of boys - there were 54% of girls 
against 46% of males.
Another significant feature is that the number of people came from overseas had highly invreased between these three dates: 5% from 3 countries 
in 1928, 6% from 27 countries and finally 28% from 98 countries in 2008. Contrary to a percentage of people came from the nearest areas had 
decreased a lot.
All in all, it can be supposed that education now becomes more essential and also more affordable for youth.
