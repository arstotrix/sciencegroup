Nowadays we have a lot of advantages from technological development. People can use Internet in order to keep in contact with the friends and colleges, using social networks, or as a great source of information for different purposes. Although some people think that Internet is a great invention of the time, other people suppose that it is unreliable source and we should use it carefully.
In my opinion, Internet is a great helper in peopleâ€™s life. Firstly, it became an integral part of many people who want to keep in touch with their family of friends. Today long distances are not the problem for people any more.  A person can write an email and even call on Skype to another person and share emotions. From my point of view, it plays a big role for many people, because they, for example, can find a job or study abroad and do not miss relatives and friends a lot. Moreover, in the Internet a person can find anything he or she would like to. Almost all the books, articles are now uploaded there and people can use it for free or pay money for it. A person does not need to spend hours in the library searching for particular information that is needed for some purposes. In addition, in the Internet a lot of interviews (sometimes even with a transcript), videos and other various things exist that are also can be useful for people.  
However, some people are concerned that the Internet is not a good source of information. In my opinion, a person should just pay more attention to the details of the data they use, such as  links, name of authors and maybe even popularity of the website and, in this way, common sense would help to understand whether the information is reliable or not.
To conclude, the Internet is a great invention that is very useful for people in different purposes. Using it carefully a person can benefit from it a lot.
