It is a common problem to be nervous before the presentation or meetings. You should be confident and be yourself. Repeat your speech before the performance not to be complicated. Use quoting to make your speech more interesting. You also should speak up and put emphasis on main theme. Do not rambler and explain clearly, so everything would be ok.
I am good at dialoging, and also have a sense of humor, but in English I have a speech impediment, because of my little vocabulary.  I always try to hold a reasonable pace of my speech and pay attention to interlocutor. I think I should be more confident and improve my skills in English!
