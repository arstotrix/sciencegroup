This demographic table by Australian Bureau of Statistics shows us the percentage of Australian women who gave birth to a particular number of children — from zero to four or more.  The research had been held for 25 years and data were collected fourfold: in 1981, later in 1986 and then every following decade — in 1996 and in 2006. Each time only women aged 40-44 were studied (most likely, because it is an age period when women’s fertility starts to reduce).
The greatest changes can be seen in the portion of mothers with four or more children: it considerably decreased from 27.6% in 1981 to 11% in 2006 — almost three times as less. The percentage of women with three children also went down from about 27% in 1980s to 21.5% in the beginning of the 21st century, but the declain is not so dramatic. Other segments of an amount of the female Australians showed  a growth: childless and one-child mothers’ rate went  up to total 29.1% in 2006 from initial 16.1%. The percentage of women parenting two children seems to be the most steady one: it had risen by 6,6% in the first half of 1980s and then had been maintaining  the same level at 35-38%.
To sum up, we can see obvious tendencies in these data: two children is an option for all times, its rate remain stable, but the mean amount of children levelled down, probably, because of the economical development of Australia and the process of globalization.
