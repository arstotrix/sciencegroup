The project is to create an automated verb-collecting program for the recently created Corpus of Modern Greek. Its main function is providing proper marking of verbs by a) recognizing all the verbs in the texts; b) determining, which conjugation the verb belongs to; c) reconstructing the initial forms of the verbs. The program takes into account all possible stem, prefix and suffix changes of the Modern Greek verbs and contains a considerable amount of irregular verbs. Such a program allows one to mark almost all the verbs in the Greek Corpus  automatically, thereby speeding up the process of marking and decreasing the number of mistakes.
