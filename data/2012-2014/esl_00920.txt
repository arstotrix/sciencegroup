In modern society, people cannot exist without job. Some people believe that for a good life you need to have a “long shillings”, even if your job do not brings pleasure. From my point of, it is more important to work in an enjoyable place, which makes you happy.  
The first consideration is spending time. The time one spends in their career usually constitutes a significant proportion of their lifetime. Therefore, if you do not like your occupation, you will be disappointed with life on retired. Moreover, when doing something they enjoy, people tend to be more energetic, creative and participate more actively. This results in higher competence and higher salary, therefore undoubtedly a better life. A good example is Steve Jobs, one of the founders of Apple Company. He turned a hobby into one of the most profitable companies in the world.
It is clear that high wage is a crucial for better life. This is especially true for countries, with high population, for example India or China, where most people fighting for survival rather than enjoyment. Many Chines workers work hard and in bad conditions just to feet their family members.  To them choosing a job they love or hobby is unimaginable thing. Earnings are a significant factor when choosing job.
In conclusion, it is not so easy, to deal with two factors : good salary or enjoyable job. I think, you should find an occupation, which includes both these factors, but if you find an uninteresting job with high earnings, try to like it and you make a lot of profit.
