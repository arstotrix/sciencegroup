The Catcher In The Rye, written by J.D. Salinger, is a fictional novel
that was first published in 1965. The main character, Holden, in a forthright form told us about his keen perception of morality of modern society. The book had an big impact on culture of  20th century. In the beginning book discourages its jargon. Then, I learned a lot about my teen problems. I think it was very helpful for me.
This novel begins when Holden is in a hospital in California. Weâ€™s known that his behavior is irresponsible from the first moment when he loses the foils for the fencing team. We understand that he is kicked out of his school, because he is failing his classes.  Holden decides to go into New York City. He goes to bars and meets with friends. He decides to visit his sister Phoebe. She is one of the few people that Holden actually loves. Holden talks to Phoebe about his life being a failure. He is trying to understand life and his place in the world. Then he decided to visit his teacher Mr. Antolini's. She tells Holden that he has to learn not to hate everyone around him. He has to learn to love people. 
Holden has not yet learned to cope with life. He wants to stay a child and not have to deal with the "phoniness" of the adult world. The internal war with himself result in a nervous breakdown. He wants to make a connection with other people, but almost every scene in the book shows him trying to do so and failing.
The novel's protagonist has become an icon for teenage rebellion. He put into words exactly how they felt. The main character thinks everybody who is a grown up is a phony because their actions and guidance are all false. 
In novel we can see personal development of Holden. And we can understand a lot about ourselves.
