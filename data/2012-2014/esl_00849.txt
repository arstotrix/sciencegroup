The table gives us the information about students enrolments at Bristol University in 1928, 1958 and 2008.
The first thing we can see from the table is that the number of new students is equally increasing from 218 people in 1928 to 1,046 in 1958 and to 6,377 in 2008. What else can we notice is that there was more than a half of females enrolling BU (54 %) in 2008 while the majority of male students, which is responsible for 68%, was in 1958. Another significant thing is that it was 50% of students coming from within 30 miles of Bristol in 1928, while in other two years it was only 15% or 16% in a sum. What is more the number of overseas was rapidly increasing from 5% from 3 countries in 1928, 6% from 27 countries and eventually 28% from 98 countries in 2008.
To sum up, I would like to say that the changes during these three years could be related to globalization that is going deeper and deeper now in our world what we can follow through the increasing number of female and foreign students.
