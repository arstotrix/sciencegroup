The diagram and the chart deal with the situation concearning species extinctions and the way of threats that may cause it. 
On the period of a hundred years it was shown that now we are faced with the rise of species extincting which will lead to a peak in 2060. However, after this year the whole process will go down. Perhaps, currently we are not able to stop those changes.
The pie chart introduces main aspects of threating to plant life. In general, it consists of two significant spheres. The first is human impact and the second are natural events. Obviously, human influence plays greater role in the disturbing of nature. Such activities as harvesting, iogging and various developments produce about one third of a threat. On the other hand, 18.7% goes for natural events, including disasters.
To sum up, on the basis of the presented data it is prooved that nowadays we live in the period of strong changes that will continue more than 50 years. Apparently, it may be expained as negative result of human impact.
