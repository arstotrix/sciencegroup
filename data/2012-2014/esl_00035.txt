It's evident that Moscow has been having serious transport problems for many years. The government told us uncountable amount of times that they do their best to change the situation but even if there are a lot of things which have been improved, it's still a lot to do.
One of the main problems is of course traffic jams. In rush hours or in case of the bad weather there is no any sence in using one's car, because it hardly ever will be faster than tube or maybe even walking by foot. We should try to find ways out for this situation. 
One of them which is widely spread in the USA is building underground roads to unload the most conjested roads, but it can't be used in the old part of the city because of its historical significance which may be damaged. Another one is carpooling which means that colleagues who live near each other go for a work in one car. This solution is very common for Europe and the USA where the percent of people having own car is higher so, for Russia it's a bit less effective but nevertheless it may help a lot.
One which is rather alike ti the previous is HOV (high occupancy vehicle) its essense is that the extreme left row is only for cars with two or more people inside and this row is less conjested, so people try to cooperate for driving faster. 
Also it is possible to develop public transport - to make it more comfortable, to higher its level.
And there is a lot of other solutions. We just need to start being occupied with this problem much harder than today.
