The charts give information about wildlife in a particular area from 2000 to the present. The first chart gives reasons why wildlife figures have changed in the area, while the second chart looks at the wildlife which have been affected.
As we can see from the first char, habitat destruction has become the main cause for changes in wildlife population. Its percentage (43%) was twice as high than pollutionâ€™s one (21%). In the other four reasons (overexploitation, random factors, disease and introduction of exotic species) the percentage was considerably lower (15%, 12%, 6% and 3% respectively) but has also an impact .
It is clear from the second chart that most of species has decreased during the survey. Especially population of such insects as butterflies and bees were reduced over 40%. Surprisingly, despite all the disastrous causes from the first chart, figures of both mammal species (bats and foxes) have been grown (23% and 9% relatively).
To sum up, the both charts shows us that destructive conditions not always led to reducing of wildlife population, occasionally, an amount of some species is growing, because they fight for surviving.
