As modern technology has become an integral part of our lives it has brought many benefits.  Aimed to make life easier, technology can be also a detrimental thing. Except for its virtues technology has a serious shortcoming that becomes evident after continuous using devices. Nowadays people have become so reliant on modern technology that they are no longer able to do many everyday things without it and, unfortunately, they have no need for acquiring some basic life skills.
Many devices, from mobile phones to computers, have a keyboard. Although in many cases it is the only way to input information, typing by pressing buttons makes people forget how to write neatly.  As a result they have illegible handwriting that is not easy to be read correctly.
Another device, for example, the calculator, is a helpful thing when you need to sum up many-valued or fractional numbers. But appealing to calculator too often with any small requests makes people to forget how to add up in oneâ€™s head even two-digit numbers. I have experienced the situation like that. On a math exam it was forbidden to use calculator and I have lost some time trying to remember how to multiply numbers in a column, so I had no time to finish the test as the exam has ended.
To sum up, the advantages of modern technology should not be overestimated. In order not to forget many basic skills important for life people should not be so reliant on technology and only then it could make life easier and bring more benefit than harm.
