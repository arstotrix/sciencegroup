Phenomenology of responsibility in the choice of life strategies in adolescence
With age, a person usually gets more and more life experience, but it does not usually guarantee the psychological maturity of the individual. Avoidance of difficult situations, lack of initiative and independence in decision-making,  the charge of others of your own problems, grudges, moods, and complaints about life are all signs of infantile behavior.
In this paper it is supposed that the starting point in psychologically unripe behavior is the adolescence - time of the personality formation, which includes the process of creation of its worldview, moral consciousness, values orientation, professional interests, and other facilities.
The paper hypothesizes that the sooner a person separates from the parental family, the more independent and responsibleshe will act in further life.
 three main strategies of individual life behavior are analyzed in the paper: "on autopilot", the reflective strategy and "manual
control".
The study consists of two parts: the interviewing and the so-called "forming" experiment, which includes 40 respondents who use different life strategies.
