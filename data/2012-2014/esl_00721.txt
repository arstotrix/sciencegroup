Originally serialized in the Conan Doyle’s strand magazine of Sherlock Holmes. 

Dr. James Mortimer visits the investigator. He tells a story about an ancient manuscript. There is  the terrible curse of the Baskervilles . The patient and friend of Dr. Mortimer Sir Charles Baskerville died. His body was found on the misty and desolate moors. And far from this place where body was found there were traces of a huge dog.

Watson decides to go to moors and meets Holmes. Lately they found the body of a convict. Sir Henry go away from Stapleton and go home. Stapleton lets  the dog on the Sir Henry’s trail: a huge , black dog  with  luminous mouth and eyes (mouth and eyes were greased phosphoric composition) . Holmes shoot the dog. Holmes find Stapleton’s  wife tied up in the back room. At the end she refused to help her husband to hunt for Sir Henry .

First of all ,it is a mysterious story . At the beginning, the author can startle any pragmatic reader. Compared with previous novels there is more mysticism, (in)tension and mysteries.
Besides, there were amazing descriptions of the Baskerville Hall and it’s environs: desolate Devon moors , macabre haunt, etc.
Moreover, there are mysteries and amazing, genius and unpredictable villain!
Finally, want to say that when I read this book at the first time, I really wanted to have same deductive skills as Holmes has! 
In my opinion, it is very interesting and wonderful book!
