Language is one of the means of conveying our emotions. Every language has its own unique world of emotion concepts. Across the linguistic "map" of emotions it may be noticed that some of them are universal. However, there are emotion subtypes demonstrating cultural differences. Conceptualization of the emotions gives us the idea of cultural different and common features.

The main aim of this course project is to create a database that shows how the exact emotion is conceptualized throughout the languages. We have to find the general approach to description of the emotion types and their subtypes. It would help us to compare as many languages as possible and compose linguistic "map" of emotions.
