Basically, the issue of chosing a school seems to be one of the most arguable among students and their parents as well. Mostly, the youth is not capable of making a choice, because they even do not know the real education system that is partly responsible for their future career. However, parents that spend much time on working out the life plan for their golden child may not clearly see the pros and cons for the student him-/herself.

On the one hand, dealing with personal academic abilities can help the student to get rid of uncomfortable feelings that he/she has being in the class where everyone has its own level of intelligence. It is a part of social life to care about other people's opinion. Thus, when the child admit the fact that everyone around him/her are mentally equal, it becomes easier to express youself without any fear of arrogance or misunderstanding.

On the other hand, when there are students with different academic skills at school, the whole life in such a society starts to be a competition. Everyone wants to show how creative or innovative he/she is in apprehending new material or in presenting the hometask. This atmosphere may help the student to analyse his/her both advantages and disadvantages and start thinking of an area where he/she is going to work in.

To sum up, it is very important to ask the child about his personal views. Apparentely, if parents note that their child is strong enough and goal-oriented, then it would be better to let him/her study in the class where classmates are different. Because in the future life he/she might face with many obstacles based on diffrent people's capabilities.
