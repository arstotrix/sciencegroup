Industrial waste
Industrial waste is defined as waste generated by manufacturing or industrial processes. It has been a great problem since the industrial revolution. have you heard thatin the USA, the amount of waste has multiplied by approximately 12 annually after World War II over a long period of time?
This waste is generated at every stage in the production process, use and disposal of manufactured products. The main question is how to reduce it. Nowadays we are particularly worried about industrial waste because of its adverse environmental and health impact.
Theoretically, it can be solved because factures are not self-maintained, anyway they are controlled by people. So the manager has to do something to prevent the plentiful waste emission or at least to decrease it. Waste minimization includes any source reduction and recycling activity undertaken by a waste generator. Now waste management is widespread. Management of industrial waste is a popular method in which all types of waste are removed in order to reduce risks to public health.
I suppose that the environmental benefits of waste recycling are self evident. This method reduces the further consumption of natural resources and lowers the ultimate waste disposal needs. Environmentally conscious and excellent service, removing the waste give the chiefsthe opportunity not to be so nervous about their projects. Accordingly we can infer that technologies have been developed to solve a wide range of waste and other environmental and recycling problems.  
Unfortunately, even with regulations for industrial waste management, many industries spurred by profits, ignore the need to responsibly dispose of their waste. Moreover, very often industrydoestn't  concernabout the world's condition. What awaits us in the nearest future? Nobody knows exactly but each of us can imagine. People can do everything but they must not wait for  time to come but to act naturally.
