If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologists classes, I would not give them too much homework, as I would understand that this course is not the only one in their program and that they have a lot of other things to do. I believe, that to have spair time is the only way to develop creativity and writing skill as only in free time people can read books they like. What can be more useful in developing writing  than reading what you like? And not getting enough sleep can cause nothing but writer's block and crises of creativity. What is more, I would try to motivate them to write funny stories about their everyday life at their own will.
