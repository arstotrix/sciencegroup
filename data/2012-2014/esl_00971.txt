I am absolutely agree that the conflict of generations in family is the fault of the both, teens and adults. In my opinion  the cause of this conflict is the changes, which happen with teenagers. They think that they are already adult and they want to have more liberty, want to talk with teir parents as adult with adult, want to have a respectable voice in the family. But parents still suppose that teen is a child and get along with him or she as with silly child. If they both can listen each other, can adopt the position of another side the conflict will disappear.
