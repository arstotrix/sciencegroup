A story
Some years ago I had an old Russian car. It was ten years. As my father sad "It was never broken down". That means that the car never broken down before I began to use it. Each day I was founding something new that was not working: lights, accumulator, ignition and generator. Some of that list did not work and was a result of different symptoms. One day I drove on the high-speed road and began to brake. I had a long distance behind. As usually I did it slowly. Suddenly the car stopped because car brakes blocked in spite of the fact I released the brakes. It was terrible. After the car stopped in the middle of the road without any serious need, the brake pedal began to work and it was possible to move. The situation was not very good because the other car owners were not going to stop immediately. I came on the service. The "master" said that he knew what the problem is. After his work, nothing has changed. It took me a half of an hour to drive without any immediately stopped and after I applied the brakes the car came to a dead stop. About a week I travel from one service to another trying to find any specialist, who knows what is wrong. And I found the service. My rear brakes did not work: the drop of braking fluid was dropped on the brake shoe. After I broke several times the brake shoe dried out and the brakes blocked. I was happy that everything was ended well.
