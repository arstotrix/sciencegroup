The bar chart shows the information about different weight categories among inhabitants of Newton from the age of 20 to 69 in 2010. It demonstrates how the weight categories are connected with age range. 
It can be seen that more than 90 per cent of people of the youngest age group (20-29) had ideal weight or were underweight and then this number only decreased among the elder people. It is not surprising because younger people are more obcessed with a healthy lifestyle. So it is natural to see the growing number of people obese or overweight when it came to the age range from 30 to 39, a little less than half of the respondents of this age had problems with weight. The interesting fact is that whereas among people from 20 to 49 the number of obese people were increasing slightly, firstly from 5% to 10% then from 10% to 25 per cent, however, from the age group of 50-59 there had been a great increase to a level of more than 50 per cent and almost the same number remained among the people from 60 to 69. Surely, it has some connection with the fact that after 50 men and women are likely to have more problems with health than the youth, and also pay less attention to their fit.
All in all, it is quite natural that younger people are more likely to have ideal weight and to be underweight than elderly because of their youth, health and desire to look nice and sexy.
