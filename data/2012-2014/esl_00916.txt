There is a point of view that architecture is the most common indefication of all arts exist there today.I completely agree with this opinion.
Firstly, in ancient times people could do nothing except the construction and improvement their places.Actually,construction was much more important than improvement of their houses. After people built their houses,they started to decorate it.So architecture is the beginning of all arts.
Secondly,architects are the creators of humans lives.If the place where they live nas not comfortable living conditions,people will become passive and desinterested in anything.As the result,people can't concentrate their attention on things,that they want to do.
Finally,architecture is the part of surrounding us landscape.So,it should be handsome.People should enjoy watching on it
