Some people prefer stability; they are always concerned about the future and think in advance. Such people would rather stay away from venturingin order to carry on placid existence. However, there are people who are ready to sacrifice calmness to achieve their aims and fulfill wishes.It is considered that people who are willing to risk are much more prosperous than others and there is no evidence whether it is true or not.On the one hand there is more probable than nothing will be lost without risking, but on the other, such way of living is predictable andboring. First of all, people get just one bite at the cherry of human life that is why it is important to experience as much as it possible.Nobody knows how much time we are left and every minute spent has to be full of impressions and feelings. Moreover, people who take risks aremore prepared for stresses and overwork therefore even in case of failure such people are more likely to recover soon and keep on trying toachieve their goal. Furthermore, people facing risks are always tense, react and make decisions faster than others. Eventually, such people areusually appearing to be more experienced.All the characteristics listed below can be easily attributed to the description of the successful person therefore I do believe that risk is apart and parcel of success. In conclusion, I would like to argue that there is no doubt that every action has to be deliberate and well-calculated even a risk but sometimes it is useful to be spontaneous. Such behavior at least diversifies our monotonous subsistence.
