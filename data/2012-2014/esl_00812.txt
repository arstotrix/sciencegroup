The two charts give the information collected during an environmental survey. The pie chart shows the main reasons for the changes in wildlife population. The other chart shows the particular change figures in each group of animals. The information reflects the situation from the year 2000 up to the present moment.

According to the data presented in the first chart, the major factor to influence wildlife population is habitat destruction. This has been the reason for 43 per cent of changes. Another significant factor is pollution, which has influenced a fifth of changes. Two other noticeable reasons for  the changes are overexploitation through hunting and fishing and random factors such as accidents. Each of these factors has caused over than 10 per cent of changes. Desease and introduction of exotic species are important reasons for changes too, however, they are less common than the ones mentioned above.

The second chart shows the general decrease in the population of all the animal types. Insects have the biggest drop in population with the figures over 40 per cent. The population of freshwater fish species such as trout and salmon has also noticeably fallen by almost 30 per cent. Birds and reptiles numbers have also fallen but at a much lower rate. The increase in population has only occured some species of mammals and aquatic mammals: bats, foxes and otters.

On the whole, we can see the most significant decrease in the population of insects and fish. And the most powerful factor for the changes is habitat destruction, which must be connected with the constant urbanisation and the technology development.
