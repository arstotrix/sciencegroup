      When you stand by a magnificent historic cite or some unusual architecture building, everything turns over in your soul. You feel as if you have faced something important in your life, as if all your life views wouldn't have gone on living if you hadn't seen such a piece of art.
      If you find yourself at a great height of the building, the feel of immense freedom comes to your heart. Moreover, you can have an overwhelming desire to fly as a bird. If the cite is old enough or even ancient, it retains a taste of the past and your imagination figures out what was happening then. As for contemporary buildings, they always say something new to the world and from this comes an inspiration to create something new. The design and ornamentation of the buildings happen to be so stylish and innovative that the totally new culture exists with its imposing fashion and it is really interesting to know its peculiarities.
      On the whole, majestic architecture is impressive and luxurious but personally I wouldn't like to live in such building because it attracts too much people. I'd prefer unremarkable house instead.
