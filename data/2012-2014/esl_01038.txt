In this report Iâ€™m going to analyze the flowchart that illustrates the process of manufacturing of goods from the choice of resources till the last stage which is products realization.
The diagram has two cycles: first is for manufacturing process itself, and the second shows us how information can be fed back to earlier stages to enable improvements.
So, goods producing begins with the selection of primary products, then, after storage, goes the stage of production planning. After that follows the process of products assembly, inspection, testing and packaging, whereupon we get a product ready to be sent to the customer. So that we came to the last two stages: despatch and sales. Besides that, simultaneously with the production of goods there is a process of advertising. What about an information feedback, it can be provided on stages of planning, testing, sales and market research.
To conclude, products manufacturing is a complex process and it needs many specialists from different spheres(like marketing, design, sales and so forth) to work together.
