How to solve the problem of traffic jams in Moscow?
From year to year the transport situation in Moscow is getting worse. The main problem is obviously the problem of traffic congestions. Considerable social and financial resources are sent (are put? I'm not sure what verb I should use here: напрaвлены) on solving this problem. I would like to make some proposals which may make our transport better.
First of all, we know that lack of parking spaces is a real headache for drivers. That's why there should be intercept parkings close to subway stations, which are located near Ring Road (я имею в виду МКАД, не уверена, так ли он переводится на английский). For instance, near such stations as Domodedovo, Teply stan, where there is a lot of space. The other thing we have to mention is that there are a great large of lawns in Moscow. They occupy large spaces, which surely could be used as parkings. Also, at the expense of these lawns we could widen our roads. (I'm not talking about trees, just lawns). Because of the fact that Moscow is a capital, there is a great deal of government institutions of federal and regional subordination. As a consequence, lots of people go to the centre every morning. This is another cause of traffic congestion (not ordinary people but those with flashing lights on the roof of the car). The possible solution can be moving these institutions to the suburbs. However, before doing it we should pave the road to avoid traffic jams there. Furthermore, we can pave several chords in Moscow, because now the whole traffic is based on the principle of rings and radii.
In conclusion I would like to add that there is no doubt that we can find many more solutions to the problem. But the main thing is just to start doing something, because here, in Moscow this problem has come to unthinkable extent.
