Abstract.
A study in language variation: palatalized vs. velarized /t/ followed by /e/.
The paper investigates phonetic variation in the Russian language of Moscow residents and establishes whether they use palatalized or velarized /t/ followed by /e/ during their speech in 10 loanwords such as termin 'term', strategija 'strategy'. The aim of the reported study is to find correlations between people's pronunciation and their age, gender and educational level. The research employs two methods of interviewing respondents:
a) solving a crossword puzzle with the images and definitions of words;
b) reading the words from the list by adding an adjective.
The study demonstrates that the main factor affecting the distribution of palatalized and velarized /t/ is age: with the increase of the age respondents tend to choose the velarized variant more frequently with the following exceptions:
in the words termos 'thermos' and strategija 'strategy' palatalized variant is used more often by elder people;
the word komp'juter 'computer' proves to have a fixed norm with the velarized variant. 
Correlations with gender and educational level are observed in the minority of words:
people of a lower educational level pronounce the word komp'juter 'computer' with a non-recommended palatalized variant more frequently;
in the word terrarium 'terrarium' men use the palatalized consonant more frequently than women in the younger and middle-age groups.
The study results prognosticate that the use of palatalized variant in the loanwords will be decreasing in the speech of new generations.
Key words: variation, Moscow speech, consonants, loanwords, palatalization, velarization, /t/, followed by /e/, correlations: age, gender, educational level.
