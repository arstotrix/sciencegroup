“Good communicators are born, not made”

There exists a point of view that to communicate well with other people a 

person should be born with special skills and features. Another viewpoint is that 

everyone can be taught how to be a good public speaker. I will try to consider this 

issue. 

In my opinion, it is possible to train social skills only from childhood. I am 

convinced, that sensible and careful parenting and good surrounding are what 

make a good communicator. Firstly, a person learns how to talk and, thus, how 

to create a conversation only in society. That can be proved by examples of feral 

children, which were isolated from human contact from a very young age. The 

point is that they could not learn how to speak even after years among people. 

What I am trying to say is that the art of communicating and the speaking skill 

are digested by a child in the same way (by communicating with people around 

and good parenting). Nevertheless, even an adult can be taught how to be more 

socialized. For instance, there are many psychological programs that are aimed 

to make people more cooperative and sociable or better storytellers and public 

speakers.

To sum up, the question of whether good communicators are born or can be 

made is widely debated. Nevertheless, I am sure that communicating is not a 

matter of genetic predisposition and a socialized person can be brought up with 

a sensible parenting or can be taught how to be a good public speaker by a good 

psychologist.
