The theoretical review of the term "intracorporate competition" or the problem of staff competition.
It is not a secret that in many companies employees coexist in the conditions of fierce competition. Pursuit of success, achieving better performance is easily turned into lobbing one's interest to the detriment of the others. Moreover, motives, underlying competition, can be different: that of power, material motives, motives of social recognition, achievement motive, motive to avoid failure. However, advantages in status, job position, authority, access to the resources usage often serve as the ground for such competition.
Staff competition within 1 company presents, on the one hand, a struggle for new additional privileges of high level and scale; in this case we speak of attack form of competition; on the other hand, it presents a struggle for retention of existing advantages: occupies positions, posts, special authority; in this case we speak of protecting form of competition. Different employees have one leading strategy of active competition in different situations.
