Good communicators are born, not made
I partly agree with this statement, because all people are different. Somebody can be born with this ability, somebody can get it during the life.
The ability of good and easy communication with people is very good quality. It's also very useful, because get in conversation with any person, make a presentation of something spontaneously, etc. People, who were born with this quality, are luckier. But in my opinion it's not a big problem if you don't have this quality. If you want to be a good communicator, you need to spend more time in society talking with other people or maybe you need to go to some special courses.
Restating my point of view, I want to say everything is possible and depends only on you.
The opening of a new building
Hello, ladies and gentlemen! This is our new project and I would proudly represent it! So, how did we build it? The building took 7 months and our company spent 2 million dollars on it. There were used a lot of new scientific technologies in a process of building. It's an innovation. It's a new dimension. You can estimate all of the species of this tower on the interactive displays which stand at hall. Oh, we have one surprise! Do you know what is it? No? It's a colorful lights which backlight the tower from 8 pm to 6 am! So, and now you can enjoy! Thank you for your attention!
