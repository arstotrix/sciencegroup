The problem of including unpaid community service in school programmes as an obligatory part is very arguable. Some peaple belive that it will ot get any benifit and even may make educaional system worse. Nevertheless, others consider this idea apropriate.
to my mid such activities as improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children can help pupils to get some positive qualities. They will learn to take a responsibility for other people. Moreover, such types of activities will teach them to do something for other people not for money but for free. So unpayd community service can teach pupils to become more kind and trustful. Also it will halp them to get some qualities, which are required in adult life. Some people can say that such kind of activities is useless. So it will just take pupils' time and will not allow them to do something more important and will not leave them anough time to learn. Also some parents can disagree to make unpaid community service a part school program because they think that their children should not do that kind of things for free.
I agree that sch activities as improving the neighbourhood are rather benificial for pupils. So, I take the idea to include them in school program positively. Of course, it shold not take too much time.
