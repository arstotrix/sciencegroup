The statics for passenger traffic at international airports in 2006 present an interesting situation.
Three  the least positions decreased its passenger traffic but it didn’t change the whole case. In comparison with the last year the beginning of the table maintained to be similar, although the leading three airports lost some amount of   passengers.
Hartsfield Jackson airport kept the first place in the table,the second place belonged to O’Hare Airport with the invisible losing the traffic and the trird place still connected with London Heathrow Airport. On the one hand, reduction of traffic in this case didn’t mean the alteration of ranking, bur on the other hand there was a disappointment with Hartsfield Jackson airport because it had the worst score of change. 
Paris Charles De  Gaulle airport due to its increase change the rank in table and instead of 7 now it keeps 7.
Really unexpected picture we can see in Beijing airport and in Suvarnabhumi airport. A rise in volume of traffic in Beijing airport was near 20%. So the airport moved forward in the table from 15 place to 9. Almost the similar situation with Suvarnabhumi airport. In comparison  with the Beijing,no doubt, rise of traffic is behind. It was just near 10%, and made the hike in 3 places from 18 to 15.
To make a conclusion about the whole table, it is important to notice that rise of traffic was shown by airports that in 2005 were hot in the leading positions.However,the beginning of ranging makes us to think that there is a static situation now.
