Sorry, I have not written, I was busy. Good news! I decided to title as 'Madwoman in Attic'. What do you think? Now ghost live not on top floor, but on attic. Hero hears footsteps above him and goes to attic. He see young girl. I don't know, what will happen next, I will tell you next blog. 
I have finished chapter 5. Hero name is Peter Youngblood. He is an architect, so he understands, how houses are built. I need someone who knows about the ghost. May be the person, who has sold the house? Is it too easy? What do you think?
Publishers are happy about chapters 1 and 2. Now deadline is February. I am happier a lot.
