Modern technology has become an integral part of our everyday life and with its constant development we are getting more and more different devices and programs which make our life easier in many ways. However, in some cases, these excellent inventions, designed to simplify things for people, make them unavailable to acquire some basic life skills.

For example, calculator, small program which is now built into every notebook and smartphone makes pupils and student fully forget how to do menthal arithmetic. Once I realised that it is hard for me to sum up twenty four and fifty seven in my mind, I've decided not to use calculator for such easy exercises. It is not only weakens our brains, but also makes us unable to notice when someone, for example, tries to cheat us in counting.

Having said that, I think that the gravest disadvantage of this technological progress is not connected directly with our brain, but with our mind. What we are forgetting now and furute generations might even fail to learn is how to communicate in person. With all these internet resources we can order food, buy clothes, meet friends without talking with a single person. I suppose that it changes us a lot, very shy or lazy people may even don't go outside their houses for a week, a month or even more. It is like a cool combo - it destroys at once our ability to communicate, to make friends, to see real things, to love and to live a moment. It just makes our life a total fake! So, we shouldn't be too reliant on our Facebook friends or on our favourite food delivery site, because one day it might all just disappear and we will be all alone in this world.

All in all, I think that, it is true that we rely too much on modern technology, so when we can do things by ourselves, without using any program or device, it is better to do it this way.
