The chart below shows places visited by different groups of people living in Australia. The groups are: people who were born in Australia, new migrants born in English-speaking countries and new migrants born in other countries.
At first glance it is clear that the most visited place is the cinema and the least visited is the theater. The percentage reaches a peak of 70% and drops to 25% respectively.
However this correlation does not apply to new migrants born in non-English-speaking countries. Here the picture is different with 55% of library visitors compared to 40% and 38% of native English speakers. 
In general it is difficult to say what group of respondents is the most active but new migrants born in English-speaking countries are more common visitors to two of the four examined places: the zoo and the theater. However, interestingly enough, the most non-active group is the last one (the new migrants born in other countries) - it has the smallest figures for all the places except for the library.
