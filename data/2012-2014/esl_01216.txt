This table gives us the data as percentage of the number of children of women aged  40 to 44 years, who lived in Australia. My aim is to figure out the changes and   notice the tendency.
On average among women of this age the highest percentage since 1981 to 2006 was occupied by those who had two children. In the period from 1981 to 2006 the percentage of such kind of women increased by 9.3 percent . This table illustrates clearly the extent to which the number of women, who had two children increased. There was a tendency of rise. Also comparing to 1981 by 2006  it became more and more women who had given a birth to only one child.
The highest proportion of childless women of this age group was noticed in 2006. In comparison  with their number in 1981 the percentage increased almost two-fold.
The absolute maximum among women who had four  children was noticed  in 1981.  The diagram shows that from 1981 to 2006, the percentage decreased by more than half.
Thus, there was a tendency. From 1981 to 2006, the percentage of those women who have 3 or 4 children, significantly  decreased. The number of  40 â€“ 44 aged Australian mothers  of only  one child increased rapidly, and the highest percentage  belonged to mothers of two children.
