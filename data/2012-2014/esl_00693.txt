Nowadays parents tend to make their children study foreign languages as early as it's possible. that's why there are lots of teachers of foreign langages even at primary school. Anyhow, the question still exists: is it useful for children to start learning foreign languages at primary school?
Some people strongly support this idea abd believe in usefulness and necessarity of this wa of education. Especilally after scientists proved that it's much more easier for children to study foreign language then for adults. One more fact is that if a child starts studying foreign language in early age, he/she can speak it as a native speaker. People trust these evidence. And as foreign languages are important  for career, voyages, international communication, they want their children to have better future.
Anyhow, there is another opinion. Many parents image the happy childhood without too difficult things as foreign langages. They fear if their children may have disgustion to the process of study at all with the help of foreign languages. So it's better to study learning it at secondary school, in their opinion.
To my mind, our integrated world and international connections obviously expect the knowledge of at least one foreign language from us. And it's even better now to know 2 or 3 foreign languages. So if a child starts to learn one of them earlier, he/she will know better by the time he can start the second one and it won't lead to mixing the languages. the child will have time and an opportunity to stdy more languages. And it can help him to participate in the programmes of changing students between universities.
