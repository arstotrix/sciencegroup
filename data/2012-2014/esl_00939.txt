The table shows statistics changes in the number of children for 40-44-year-old women.  It demonstrates data for 1981, 1986, 1996 and 2006 in Australia.
On the basis of this table, we can say that the percentage of childless women this age group rose sharply from 8.5 to 15.9. Also, during 25 years, the percentage of families with one or two children has increased. In the first case, a strong increase in the birth rate doubled, in the second case, the percentage rose quite sharply from 29.0 in 1981 to 38.3 in 2006. However, the number of large families is very diminished. If the percentage of families with three children fell by only 5 points, that the number of large families decreased from 27.6 to 11.0. Looking at the table, it is surprising how the percentage of mothers of many children, which was higher than the percentage of childless women, so much has fallen, that has become smaller in 2006 that the percentage of women without children.
