Towards lexical typology: a case of "old". 
The semantic field 'old' is of interest for lexical typology since it is not only tending to a universal lexicalization, but display a considerable and non-trivial variation of lexical systems across languages. Using so-called 'framing approach' to define a parameter against  which cross-linguistic comparison can be undertaken, the polysemous adjective "old" is broken  up  into senses, that is, four basic interpretations (frames) of 'old', depending on internal semantic characteristics that different constructions 'old + N' possess. Thereby, paper distinguishing  among the following frames :  (i) old man ("by age"), (ii) old friend ("of long standing"), (iii) old boss ("ex-, former"), (iv) old masters ("ancient, belonging to another epoch").The results of this study show that frames can be differently combined within a certain "basic" lexical item in different languages. Taking into account the number of such combinations, one can speak about "dominant" old systems (like that of Albanian and Mandarin Chinese) that covers all four frames by one lexeme, "binary" systems (like that of Mari and Tatar) that has two lexemes which are complementarily distributed to express a certain semantic opposition, e.g. animate-inanimate, and "rich" system (examples are Quechua and Evenki), where four frames are distributed among four separate lexical items.
