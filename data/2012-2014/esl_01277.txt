Today as the industry of design reaches the peak of the popularity everyone is preoccupied by the influence of interior decorations on the well-being of a person. It should be said t:hat the opinions have divided: some people think that rightly designed interior is essential for good health and mood, and the others are sure that well-being depends on completely different factors.
By and large, the first point of view seems more preferable for me because it is scientifically proved that interior design can affect health and productivity. In fact, colors and shapes have a great influence on our mood and mental processes. If a person feels comfortable at home or at work, he or she will surely be friendlier with the family, friends and coworkers and will be more concentrated and creative.
Nevertheless, the second position is also convincing. It can be said that people need to pay more attention to the content but not to the shape and the internal is much more important than the external. It is true that to become better and to reach success itâ€™s not enough to change an interior design, first of all every person needs to change his or her way of thinking. 
Therefore, to sum everything up I can say that interior decorations are surely important for well-being however, they are not the only factor of it.  The mood and the will of are person are much more important.
