The problem of children's education is now at the heart of the debate. Some people say that one of the certain aim of the scholar system is to make childrem a real patriots, tre citezents who care about their society. that's why several people propose to make an upaaid commnity service a compulsory part of high school programme and thus educate hildren in spirit of emotional virtues, such as...
As for me, I don't subscribe to this point of view. This initiative seems to me useless, because we can't just teach someone to be a "good man". Imposing children our will, forcing them to do something we can provoque a contraversal effect: pupils will found a work for charity desgusting just because someone push on them.
Someone could treat me as an idealist, but I think that it's a right of every person to deside weather he/she would work for charity or not, and if it is not volontier, it is nothing but hypocrithity.
Of course, society will have some benefits, imposing children to do some unpaid community service, but children are not slaves and they have a right to pass their free time the way they want.
To sum up, I'm against unpaid community service in schools.
