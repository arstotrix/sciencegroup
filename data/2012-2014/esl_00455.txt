The interesting thing I've done so far
I like spending my free time reading books and the last book I've read is 'A Farewell to Arms' by Ernest Hemingway. It's not the first book written by this famous author that I've read, but that one is definitely one of my favorite ones. Let me tell you about it.
The plot of the novel was based on Hemingway's own life experience. The story described in the book took place during the World War I and, what is notable, to my mind, is the fact that American-born Hemingway, as well as the main character in the book Frederic Henry, was a member of the Italian army. His rank was lieutenant or 'tenente' in the Italian language. The book focuses on a romance between Frederic Henry and a Scottish nurse Catherine Barkley. Their love story is opposed to the war, which makes it look even more tender and important. Besides, Frederic's life during the war is full of serious events that changed his life and him as a personality forever. The main conclusion that he makes is that there's nothing worse than the war, he finally realized that he hated the war as much as he could. The ending of the book was very unexpected for me, but I won't tell it here not to ruin the whole plot for those who will probably read the book later. 
To sum up, I'd like to say that Ernest Hemingway's books are extremely enjoyable, they're full of good humor and are interesting to read. I think that the books based on somebody's own experience are the best ones, so Hemingway's works are the ones that I really like.
