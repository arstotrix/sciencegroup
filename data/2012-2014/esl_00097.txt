Despite the abundance of research into the psychological support to patients with intractable disease, little is known about the components of their well-being and hence, about the effective ways to improve it. The present article suggests that self-transcendence is one of the main factors of one's well-being and happiness. Therefore, there was conducted a study, aimed at the investigation of the role of self-transcendence on patients with intractable disease( especially  it's correlation with subjective well-being). Forty-four patients with intractable disease completed the Self-Transcendence Scale (STS) and the Japanese version of the World Health Organization-Subjective Inventory , they also got through the Japanese version of the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview. The controls were 1854 healthy individuals. The analysis proved that there is a significant increase in  self-transcendence among the intractable disease group, and that there is a strong direct correlation between self-transcendence and respondents' subjective well-being. The outcomes of this research can help us learn more about the role of self-transcendence on patients with intractable disease : how self-transcendence helps them to regain their mental well-being.
