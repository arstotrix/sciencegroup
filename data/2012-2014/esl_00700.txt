It is widely discussed whether it is necessary to include unpaid community service into school programmes. I strongly believe that it is a very efficient improvement of school programm.
First, it is a simple method to educate young people. As the job they would be provided with is not paid, it could be easier to make them to get used to work or even it is possible to give rise to labour without thinking of salary.
Second, charity and volunteer work develops such qualities like generosity, kindness, helpfulness and capacity to manage their lives and cope with their problems as well as the others'. People become more responsible and mature. It is also probable that such experience of a work might help with the choice of one's future profession.
Third, this may be profitable for the society itself. Many problems like with wild packs of dogs and cats, environment pollution will be resolved.
I know many examples of how good charity and upaid work affected youth. Helping people in need, cleaning streets, helping with abandoned animals made them grow up a bit and change their view on life in general, Some can't stop helping and being volunteers as they really enjoy it. I myself had an experience of volunteering and am pretty fond of it. I find it good for socialisation, because I worked with kids from schools during olympiads and even befriended some of them.
To conclude, I can not find any drawbacks in introducing obligatory volunteer work into school programm.
