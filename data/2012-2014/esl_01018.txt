I've read review  by Rodman Philbrick on a book called <<To Kill a Mockingbird>> by Harper Lee and I wanted to share with you how I feel about it.
I think that author of the review had carried away writting this. I think that he gives too much his attention to the content. I’ve read this book and I think that Rodman Philbrick spoils the book. Of course, review should tell us a concise summary of the content and critical assessment of the content, but I wanted to read more about how the author of the review feels about the book he had read.
In this review one thing absolutely confused me. Rodman Philbrick states that he think that the most important character is Atticus Finch. In my opinion he isn’t, but it was interesting to read other point of view on this book. However, this could make an impact on a person who haven’t read this book and prevent to make personal opinion.
In the end author claims that even though the story took place many years ago, you get the idea that parts of it could happen today and I absolutely agree with it. I’d recommend everyone to read this book and then read the review and make your own opinion.
