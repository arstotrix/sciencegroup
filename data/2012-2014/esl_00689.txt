Nowadays, foreign languages are very important for our life. Some people think that the primery school is the best time to learning foreign languages. Others argues that children in secondary school have more linguistic ability to study languges. What about myself, I think that primary school is better than secondary, because at an early age the stuff learned better.
I would like to examine the advantages an disadvantages of learning foreign languages in primary and secondary schools. On the one hand, it is well-known, that children have more linguistic capacity at an early age. There are a lot of examples when the children from billingual families can speak frequently in their early age. Therefore, earlier students have more richer vocabulary.
On the other hand, some people believe that the understanding the foreign languages (the structure, the word order) could come only to secondary school's students. Moreover, the students of secondary school know better, what they want from foreign language. It could be business aspect or only conversationl ability.
However, the children, who startes to learn foreign languages in primary school grasp the skills and foreign words quickly, than children in secondary school.
To sum up, I would like to stress that it's better for kids to speak the second language, when they studing in primary school, because language skills are not like other techniques which we can aquire at old ages.
For instance, student from secondary school learn harder the second language not to mention the third. It could be explained with other works they must  do and remember.
