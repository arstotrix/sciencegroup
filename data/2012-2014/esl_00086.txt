The introductory paragraph
The study examines the values' role in forming psychologists' professional self-determination. The theme of self-determination has a widespread appeal within a scientific context at present time, and self-determination issue can be found at the heart of numerous discussions in the modern psychology. Self-determination is a process and a result of choosing the goals, means of self-realization by the particular person in the particular circumstances. The point of psychologist's self-determination is also hotly debated time and again: detailed discussions involve topics of professional psychological education, development of the psychologist, psychologist's professional portraits, competencies and qualities.  However, little attention has been given to the values' part in the development of self-determination. The study aims to create a theoretical model, in which both personality treats and values shape the self-determination of psychologists. More precisely, the research is concerned with HR-managers' and consulting psychologists' values, which contribute to their professional self-determination. The study  a large body of literature on the subject - both theoretical and empirical. The  model will be empirically verified in our further research and, furthermore, the frame will provide the opportunity to define the role of values in psychologists' self-determination.  Results   enrich our understanding of the self-determination as a developing process, confirm and expand the existing scientific models of this phenomenon. Moreover, the findings can be practically used in professional education and consulting.
