	The given charts present the assessment of the weight of inhabitants of Newtown, comparing the data gathered in 1950 to the one that reflects the situation in 2010. Though these graphs definitely have something in common, the differences between them are interesting as well.
	First, it should be said that having an ideal weight used to be typical for nearly half of Newtown inhabitants both in 1950 and in 2010, except one certain category - people between 60 and 69. Though it was about 50% in the previous century, the number of older people having an ideal weight has enormously decreased by the present day. Now it equals only 5 per cent.
	As for the obesity, it didn't used to be a problem in the past but then became a considerable one, according to the graphs. The per cent of obese people didn't get higher than 10 in 1950 in the frames of any age group; in 2010, however, it increases from each group to the next older one, and more than a half of people aged 60-69 suffer from obesity as a result.
	Underweight doesn't seem to be a problem in 2010, though about 20 per cent of people used to have this weight characteristic in 1950. The situation with slight overweight have changed only for the group of oldest people - and again, the number of those who suffer from overweight increased, which seems quite logical, looking back at what was said before.
	To sum up, the certain problem with obesity and overweight has appeared in Newtown. The main age category that suffers from is obviously older people.
