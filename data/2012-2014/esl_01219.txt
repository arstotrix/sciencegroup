The topic of today’s debates is the problem of current interest for all the people who even once faced with education in their life. Testing system is highly popular all over the world now both in schools either in the universities. Do we have to follow this system further and which pros and cons it has? The debates showed us the stated problem from different perspectives. 
Today people use to blame the testing system because it leads to conformism, narrow-mindedness and lack of creativity. But I totally disagree with this opinion.  
First of all we all live in the society where we need to cooperate. Every day we face with “team work” everywhere: at school, at work or just on the streets of our city. Noam Chomsky said if we have no standards we can’t cooperate with other people.  That means we still need some standards in our life that’s why we have them in sphere of education. Applying standardized system we teach pupils how to act in the society. 
The other argument against the testing is that it kills creativity and doesn’t inspire people on inventing something. But here we need to say we still have music, art, dancing classes and nobody wants to replace real practice with testing. For the education system to be balanced we need to have equal part of theory and practice and testing system helps us to provide high-quality control of knowledge which is assessed  as objectively as possible. 
I don’t see any disadvantages in having some frameworks in education. It does not mean that we prevent people’s creative impulse. The frameworks are flexible. We have the opportunity to move them as we want and there is a great power of creativity.
To sum it up the testing system that we have now is a great tool which helps us to not only give people knowledge but also teach them live in the society where equality, politeness and tolerance is the key for peaceful and happy life.
