Everyone knows that every little doing influences the environment around us and most of them leads to irreparable consequences. The chart indicate that 81.3% of threats to plant life is human impact, that is agriculture, development, logging, livestock and others affect the flora a lot. And that leads to extinction of plant species and the level of this extinction rises with time. The same disaster happens with animals. With decades the number of animal species that become extinct grows immensely. As the graph shows in 2060 there will be the culmination. The extinction will reach 50,000 million species per decade. After that  the level of extinction will fall, but the figures will still remain high.
