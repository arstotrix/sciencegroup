Nowadays sporting events are widely covered in mass media. Some people believe that because of this young people do not want to take part in any sports themselves. However, I cannot agree with their opinion.

The main argument of those people is that youngers feel useless among famous sportsmen and sportswomen. When young men and women look at sportspeople on television, they lose self-confidence. They realize how hard is it to be as good at sport as Olympic champions and decide not even to try. Nevertheless, I am convinced that sport celebrities have an opposite impact on young people. Teenagers idolize famous sportspeople and try to copy them. Besides, when someone sees all victories and defeats of his or her idol, that man or woman can adopt only the best sport methods and try to avoid the other sportsperson’s mistakes.

Another argument of sport coverage opponents is that sport programs allow young people to feel sport excitement through watching sport without actually doing it. Sitting in front of TV, you do not have to strain your muscles and spend your time on training. You can just watch sport shows and have a good time. However, I believe that those people who are really interested in a sport, will not restrict themselves to just TV-watching. They will definitely take up some sport, because nothing can compare with your own achievements.

To sum up, despite the fact that there are people who accuse sport programs of bad influence on young people, this problem is overstated. I’m sure that there is no such impact on young people.
