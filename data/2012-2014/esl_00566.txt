The bar charts show the information about the weight of the people who lived in Newtown in 1950 and in 2010.The data is grouped by the age of the people in both cases.
The general tendencies are different. In 1950 the most part of the population was in good form but in 60 years the difference between young and old became more marked. The share of underweight people is similar in both diagrams fluctuating over all groups.  The same can be said about the amount of overweight people in 1950 and in 2010. The only difference is that in 1950 there were no overweight adolescents. 
 About 70 per cent of the people aged 20-29 had ideal weight. Middle aged people showed less good results. Those who were between 30 and 39 years had a share of approximately a half of people being fit while the per cent people who were in their 40s and 50s and in a good form at the same time was about 40. The oldest inhabitants of the city were mostly obese, overweight or underweight showing the result of just 5 per cent. 
The amount of young obese people was equal to zero in 1950, as in 2010 we can see that it grew to 3 per cent and continued to rise fast from 10 per cent in the group "30-39" to 40 per cent of the oldest people.
