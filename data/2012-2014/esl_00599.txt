The graph shows predicted extinctions of plant and animal species in tropical forests and the pie chart demonstrates threats to plant life. All threats are devided into two subgroups - human impact and natural events.

As we can see in the first graph, extictions are expected to increase evenly from about 5 000 in 2000 to 50 000 in 2060. Then the number of extinctions is supposed to decrease to roughly 30 000 in 2100.

The pie chart shows that the extinctions are caused mostly by human impact, as natural events make up only 18.7% of the reasons of the extinctions, which is four times less. The most harmful kind of human impact is agriculture (18.7%), which is followed by harvesting (14.4%), development (10.4%) and logging (9.7%). Another reasons (livestock, disturbance, invasive species, plantations and other human impacts) make up about 5% each and about 27% in total.
As for natural events, which are not given in details, they consist of 7% of natural disasters and 11.7% of other natural events.
