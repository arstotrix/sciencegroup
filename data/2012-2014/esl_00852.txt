The table below gives information about student enrolments at Bristol University in 1928, 1958 and 2008.

To begin with, the number of enrolled students at Bristol University has greatly increased from 218 students in 1928 to 1,046 students in 1958 and 6,337 in 2008, which is about 29 times more than there were in 1928. There became slightly more female and less male students. It can be caused by opening new faculties, which are more popular among girls, for example, faculty of philology or history. Another reason for this can be the feminization in Europe. 

We can also see that the number of students who come from Bristol and its vicinage has roughly decreased from 50% in 1928 to 14% in 1958 and to 1-2% in 2008, which is 50 times less. Moreover, there became much more international students. While in 1928 the amount of students was only 5% from 3 countries, in 1958 it became 6% from 27 countries, which is not much more, but than in 2008 it became 28% from 98 countries, which shows that Bristol University has organized a great exchange programmes. 

To sum up, there is a clear picture of Bristol University developing and expanding and communicating with another countries.
