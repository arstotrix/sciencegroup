The graph gives information about where people living in Australia go to spend their spare time. This chart presents 3 categories of Australians: migrants from English-speaking countries, migrants from other countries and Australians born and bred.   There are also four popular places where they prefer to spend their free time: Zoo, Library, Theatre and Cinema. 
The graph shows that the most popular place to waste time for people born in Australia in English-speaking countries is cinema. As for migrants born in other countries, there are 55% prefer library to other places.  This can be explained be the fact that the majority of movies and plays are in English and migrants that do not know this language would rather go to library to improve it.  Zoo is not frequented a lot as much as cinema does, but there are 50% of migrants born in English-speaking countries that visit this place. 
The least frequented place by all of Australians is theatre. There is interesting and disappointment fact: English speakers prefer other places to zoo as well.  According to the schedule only 20% of people born in Australia spend their spare time there. There may be many reasons why do people rarely go to the theatre:  the absence of theatre in the place of residence (in contrast with the cinemas that are placed almost in every district), disinterestedness in this kind of art, very expensive tickets. 
The graph shows unequal distribution of percentage.
