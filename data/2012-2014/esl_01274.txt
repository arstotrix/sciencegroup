The flow chart provides us the information about the process of manufacturing of the consumer goods and receiving information feedback to adjust the production on different levels.
The process of manufacturing is complicated and consists of 11 stages realized in series. Firstly, raw materials and manufacturing products are stored together and the producers create the production plan with the production research and designing. The next stage is the assembly, than the product is inspected and tested. When it is done it the packaging and the dispatch are realized. Later the market research is done and the advertising of the product invented. Finally the product goes on sale
From the given scheme, we can see that the feedback is available for the producer on six periods of the process of production. In that way the adjustments can be brought on six stages of manufacturing: the storage, the production planning, the design, the testing, the market research and the sales. Three in the beginning and three closer to the final stage of production.
Overall, we can conclude that the process of manufacturing combines multi-staged production and research for a feedback on different levels of manufacturing, which is organized to bring adjustments and control the process of production.
