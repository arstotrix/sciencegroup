Some people believe that humans should be able to use animals for their own benefit, while others argue that the rights of animals should be protected.
On the one hand, I agree with people who consider the usage of animals for their own benefit to be possible but only if they are scientists or doctors. It is common knowledge that modern medicine makes progress and needs to examine their products but on whom will they do it if not on animals? To my mind, humans should use animals (rats or rabbits) for inventing new medicines. Speaking about animals' meat, in my opinion, it can't be helped.
On the other hand, the society supports defenders of animal rights. I think it is great that people eventually realize that the number of animals reduces every day because of humans. So there are a lot of rescue programs for different animals around the world. I admire such kind of people, their strong will and faith in what they do. But defenders of animals can't propose yet the real alternate of using animals for the human purposes. 
Summing up, I'd like to say that people can't live without animals. We need animals not only to eat their meat but for some high aims like friendship, medicine and technology. Some animals are organ donors for humans, animals help scientists to examine new medicines, and besides the first creatures in space were animals. Unfortunately or fortunately, human is the most powerful and intelligent animal on earth so it is up to us not to do more harm than good, to change something that can help every creature live in peace.
