Sorry, I haven't written to you for so long, I was really busy.I have some good news! I've decided to title my new blog entry "Mad women in Attic". What do you think about it? Now the ghost is not on the top floor but in the attic. The hero hears footsteps above him, goes to the attic, and sees a young girl there. I don't know what happens next. I will tell you in the next blog. I have already finished Chapter 5. Hero's name is Peter Youngblood. He is an architect so he understands how houses are built. He needs someone who knows about the goes. Maybe it will be the person, who sold the house. Isn't it too easy? What do you think? Fortunately, my publishers are pretty happy with chapters 1 and 2. Now deadline is February and this makes me a lot happier.
