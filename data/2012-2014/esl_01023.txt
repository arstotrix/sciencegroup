Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
It was a pleasure to read.

When I was younger my grandma had bought me a book called The Martian Chronicles. I had liked these short stories and especially the way writer talk to readers. Since that time Ray Bradbury became one of my favorite writers. However, I've read Fahrenheit 451 recently, about two years ago. This has been one of my favorite books since I first read it. 

As it is written in encyclopedia Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel. The novel is divided into three parts: "The Hearth and the Salamander", "The Sieve and the Sand", and "Burning Bright". I think that it is stupid to give a short summary of the book, because it is hard to tell someone about this book without spoiling it. But I'm absolutely sure that everyone must read Fahrenheit 451 and make his or her own opinion about this incredible book.

In this book we see the new world where fireman starts fire and books are outlawed. It sounds weird but in my opinion Fahrenheit 451 isn't just a "fairytale". Even though the novel had been published approximately sixty years ago you got the idea that parts of this story are happening all around us everyday. Bradbury described himself as "a preventor of futures, not a predictor of them" and we could easily draw parallels between the book and life around us.
