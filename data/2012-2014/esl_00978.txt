The gap between parents and their children's generations stemps from lack of knowledge and good will from both parties.
I agree with this stament.To my mind, generation gap is a great problem of the society. And, actually, the lack of knowledge what to do or what topic speak about is bad for childrens and their parents. Adults think that are intelligent and know everything about their children's lives. They are not trying to take into account that things as fashion and slang are changing every day. So, parents and adults can't get on well with each other, because their speach and attitude are not similar. I suggest paople who has communicative problems try to read books and magazings, use the Internet to find the way to solve their communication problems. There are a lot of workshops which help people to cope with their problems. Parents should know about them. Children, in its turn, are not very patient to their relatives. They think. that adults are to old for them, So, and children and parents should study to speak with each other on topics which everyone likes.
