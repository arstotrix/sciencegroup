For the last three years, I’ve been studying at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, and I’m very proud of being a student of such a great university.  This university has a reputation for being the best research university in Russia. And it is true, during our studies we are given many chances and opportunities to participate in numerous research projects, to find something new and undeveloped ourselves. Moreover, what I really like about studying here is the fact that I have complete confidence in my future, as I know that many prestigious companies will be happy to have me as their employee.  Although sometimes we have to spent many hours to complete our tasks and projects and there are a lot of problems related to stress caused by overwork, I am sure that all these drawbacks are insignificant compared to the great chances to get to the top in our future careers.

It had happened when I had been studying at the first course of the Higher School of Economics. As I had never been away from my home for such a long period before, I felt myself quite lonely. Quite by chance, whilst drinking a cup of coffee near my university, I ran into my very old school friend. He had left my school after the 9th grade, that’s why we hadn’t seen each other for more than four years. However, I recognized him once I saw him, as he hadn’t changed a lot.  We had been speaking for more than three hours, filled each other in on what we’d been doing since we had last seen each other. Eventually we had to say goodbye as we both had more classes this day, but we agreed to meet the other day. It had been really great to meet a close friend in a big foreign city.
