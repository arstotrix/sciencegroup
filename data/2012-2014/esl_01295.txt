When I saw the task about blogs I decided to serf the Internet and to find some of them. I had never red any blogs. It was the first time when I did it.

I have found the top of the blogs about books. Most of all I like the blog “The book wheel” which author is Allison Hilts, a voracious reader. There are a lot of pictures and covers of the books there. The navigation is easy and it is convenient even for children. Allison write her own opinion, expressions and feelings about the books which are on her website.( I love the Band Aid song. I love it so much I played it at my wedding (in August) and have a self-proclaimed “Band Aid Season”...) The books are deviden into sections. It is very useful when you want to search a book on a particular genre. Also/ there are some actual for our days news and links on other blogs and websites. In conclusion I’d like to say that readers can easily connect with the author by the email, which is written in the right corner of the webpage.
