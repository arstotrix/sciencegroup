Formal education is very important nowadays: without having one you cannot be a part of modern society. But what age is the most appropriate for the beginning of such an education? Should we send our children to school as earlier as possible, say it 4 years old, or there is a more suitable age for it?
From my point of view there are as advantages as disadvantages for any choice. For example, the younger kid is the more flexible is his brain. The flexibility of the brain is crucial circumstance for getting knowledge in an early period of life. In comparison, child may not be ready for some experience, for being exposed with some kinds of teaching.
I believe, the most important point is people should be careful, creating the plan of education for their children. This problem is supposed to be solved along with psychologists, who have professional knowledge of which age is suited to which part of education.
