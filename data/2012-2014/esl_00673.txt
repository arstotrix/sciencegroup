Nowadays, owing to the development of medicine, average life expectancy is longer in comparison to the previous generations. Why is it dangerous and what can be done to solve this problem are controversial issues worth discussing. 
	 It is often believed that an increase in life expectancy is a positive sign for the modern life. Nevertheless, this trend has a negative impact on our society. To begin with, a decrease in working population can be caused by this extension of ageing process. Therefore, to provide the elder people with pension government will increase taxes and people will have to pay more. Moreover, increasing life expectancy can lead to the overpopulation that will entail serious consequences such as lack of free space and recourses needed for everyday life. 
	However, there are some actions that could be taken to solve the problems. Firstly, government should extend the working age. In many countries people are used to work until they reach 50 years, now they can work until 60-65 years. Secondly, in order to save space authorities should build more skyscrapers rather than one-storied houses. Finally, contemporary science must think of alternative resources, which can be obtained by recycling and renewable resources. 
	To conclude, it can be seen that increasing life expectancy causes different problems. Personally, I believe that government should take measures immediately. Nowadays, these actions are really important in order to keep balance in the society and maintain the high quality of modern life.
