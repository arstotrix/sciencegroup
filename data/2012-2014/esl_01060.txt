People have been exploring space with their eyes and telescopes since ancient times and more than fifty years by satellites and space travelling. In the twentieth century each country explored space by its own in order to be on the first place and some people claim that nowadays situation is the same. In general, I agree with this view.
During the whole twentieth century there were two counties that had significant space programs – USSR and the USA. Antagonism became stronger at the period of the Cold War. Then space exploration was a question of national pride and there was almost no international cooperation. Nowadays we have more than two space exploring countries. There are also China, India and European Union involved. But I think that there is still little international effort because each country has its own space program and focuses on different things. Russia focuses on Moon exploration while the USA has a Mars project.
On the other hand, it is known that there are international space projects like Russian-Chinese collaboration or The International Space Station. But still, intercountries’ cooperation is based more on political reasons. 
I guess that there are two ways of space exploration evolution in the future, but both depend on political relations between countries. The first one leads to closer cooperation and international effort, creating corporate space project. The second leads to isolation and, probably, creating some political and space exploration unions.
To sum up, I want to say that nowadays space exploration is more to do with national pride, but situation may turn into international effort in the future if there will appropriate conditions.
