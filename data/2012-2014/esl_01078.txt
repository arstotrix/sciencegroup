Today almost everyone who knows what the Internet is and knows how to use it has a blog. Blogging especially is common among teenagers and young adults. In the blogs they write everything they think and everything what they would like to tell the world. Although there are bloggers among adult serious independent people who use blogs not for fun. As a rule, their blogs are devoted to specific topics. 
Why blogs are so common in the population?
Firstly, it is available. In other words, almost all blogs are free. To start your own blog, you just pass short registration on the site.
Second, debates and demonstrations on the streets â€“ it is unfashionable. To tell your own opinion, you can to criticize or actively support something sitting on the chair at home on the computer with access to the Internet. Blogs can help you to convey your views to the world. 
Third, many people prefer to assume the blog as a personal diary. Here you can show off your literary, poetic or artistic skills etc. Or you can just write about everything that happens in your life, describe your feelings and emotions about some events. 
As for me, I'm not an ardent fan of blogging. If I was interested in any blog, usually it is devoted to some specific topics that can give me some useful information.
Generally speaking, I think that blogging is a good thing for modern people. The main thing is to use it correctly and with good intentions.
