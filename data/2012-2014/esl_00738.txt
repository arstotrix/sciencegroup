The diagrams demonstrate main stages of coastal formation of sedimentary rock. 
First of all, a surface of the rock is been destroying for a while and then rockâ€™s fragments and stones are carried to the sea. With flows of water every fragments that are not strengthen to the rock fall into an ocean. That is how there appears a lot of materials for construction of future sedimentary rock. 
Secondly, when there are enough amounts of stones and rock fragments, they are mixed with sea salt and moved to the coast, making up bed, one after another.  A lot of beds are organized for a long period of time. This is the way how sedimentary rock is formed.
To sum up, united actions of different powers of nature and long period of time are a necessary thing in order to create a sedimentary rock.
