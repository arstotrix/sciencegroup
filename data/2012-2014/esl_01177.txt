I agree with this statement and believe that nowadays the gap between parents' and children's generations is bolted on the lack of knowledge and goodwill from both parties. Many parents talk at their children instead of talking with them. In many families parents communicate with their kids by threatening, blaming, complaining or judging. Also parents try to pressure children into doing something they want them to do. Therefore many children don't want to count on parents and don't share all secrets with them. Moreover children in today's fast-moving world spend their free time chatting on the Internet with friends using their own language that parents can't understand., Parents even don't know which interests and hobbies their children have. In conclusion I would like to say that it is important to get on well with parent, try to understand them and support your family.
