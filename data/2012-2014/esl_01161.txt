Over the last 15 years online trading has come to his golden age, dealing with a lot of technical and social boundaries. In this essay I am going. To outline how internet marketplaces has improved our lives.
Firstly, it is needed to be mentioned, that online shops save great amount of time, due to their high accessibility. It is the key factor in modern world, where time is more important than shopping experience itself. There is no need to go or drive somewhere to find something you need. And also you do not risk not to find it there. Secondly, simplicity of creating new store leads to serious competition, which make optimal prices for goods. It is just unprofitable to put a high price, when you can be easily changed for another seller.
On the other hand, the same properties have their side effects. Simplicity can be used to arrange fake web shop, which life cycle ends up at the point of receiving money from clients. All transactions should be made with great attention and security measures, such as PayPal protection. Impossibility of physical check of stuff you buy, can reflect in sad differences between thing you have bought and what you aimed to buy. And there no one can help you, only your own flair.
All in all, online shops, as like any other social technical innovation, have its positive and negative qualities. And I believe that those problems are pretty avoidable and online marketing is a step into future.
