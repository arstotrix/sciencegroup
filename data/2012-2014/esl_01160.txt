The success of the company depends on the happiness of its employees.
There are many ways to success. And history shows, that there is no one proper idea, how to gain it. There were companies, which looked like an illustration for dystopia fiction, Microsoft as for example. And they are even more then successful. And there are the others, which rely on the spirit of workers and their own freedom of creativity, Valve (famous videogame developer) as for example.  It have to be noticed, that controversy of this question doesn’t prohibit us to try to answer this question, if spirit and will of each worker are more important than other factors.
Firstly, there can be no human community in which every individual would be happy.  Personal interests always lead to conflicts. Everyone has a personal view on company’s projects and perspectives. Secondly, every company goes through dark and bright periods, and employees have to share success as same as fails. Wage cuts, overtime work, working on weekends – this are the main factors of survival during black periods. And workers can’t be happy with that. But that is the price of success.
On the other hand, small groups, such as startup companies can take risks and try to unleash their own creativity: let every employee do what he or she wants. But risks are just too high. No discipline, no plan, no deadlines – no permanent motivation to work on one thing. History knows examples, when such companies succeeded, but nobody remember failures. 
All in all, success of a company depends on a lot of things and happiness of workers is important, but not dominant.  Correct business plan, understanding of the market are more valuable.
