The table illustrates the number of children born to women aged 40-44 years in Australia in 1981, 1986, 1996 and 2006.

The most noticeable trend is that the number of women with two children always dominated. We can see from the table that in every year the percentage of two children was the highest. Moreover, in 2006, compared with 1981, the proportions of women who had given birth to three or more children decreased significantly while the number of women with none children or one child increased. Furthermore, from 1981 to 1996 women did not prefer giving birth only to one child, so the percentage of one-child families was the lowest (7.6-11.3%), but by 2006 the situation had changed, and women with four or more children took the lowest position(11%).

All in all, the number of childless, one-child and two-child families had risen by 2006. Moreover, in the past women in Australia usually had four or more children, but this percentage had decreased by 2006.
