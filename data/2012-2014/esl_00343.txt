Voice coarticulation in obstruent + coronal nasal clusters in external sandhi position in Modern Standard Russian. 
Different coarticulation phenomena are widely spread in Modern Standard Russian and depend on many prosodic and stylistic conditions. This insufficiently explored phonetic area needs detailed and extensive studies that explain some unique articulation changes in consonant groups and help foreigners in their study of Russian. The main aim of this research is to report available coarticulation findings and construct a basic phonetic portrait of consonant clusters.
The goal of my course paper is to research possible voice coarticulation in obstruent (/п/, /х/, /с/) and coronal nasal consonant /н/ in external sandhi position and within a word. Special words and groups of words with the same right and left context of consonant clusters were chosen on the basis of articulation rules. This course paper seeks to discover differences in voice coarticulations, length of consonants and formants frequency between external sandhi position clusters and within a word clusters. The data that will be presented is a small part of a huge research made by students of Moscow State University in the sphere of Russian articulation.
