Edinburgh, Scotland, first impressions.
We arrived yesterday by train. The train was very comfortable and the trip from London took about 4 hours. We saw typical Scottish landscapes and a lot of ships on the fillds. Also, it was strange to see some to much drunk people in the train, especially women. On the terminal we took a bus and went to our hotel. There were not any strait streets in the city: it is a typical city in the mountains. The hotel was also comfortable. Today we visited some museums. We went to the big castle in the center of the city. It was interesting. We saw a lot of ancient furniture and weapons. Then we decided to go to the museum of Scottish writers. We were looking for it for a long time. Than we understood that we had gone three times, but had not seen it, because it is situated in a very small house. This museum was also interesting. We saw mostly pictures and photos of famous Scottish writers there. We came to the hotel very late. We were tired, but we enjoyed our tour. Now we are thinking where we will go tomorrow.
