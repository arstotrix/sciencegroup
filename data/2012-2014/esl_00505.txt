As for me, globalisation is a normal period of evolution. Our society has many technics that can helps us to make standard of living better. Many people talk about damaging of natural resources, child labour and multinational companies because of globalisation. I do not think it depends on it because these problems were important many years ago too. We have to destroy something old to build something new and that is normal process. Of course, social inequality is awful but it is normal for civilized society and we have to respect human rights, it will be anarchy in the country with the same social status for all groups of people. Globalisation is not a catastrophe for me; it is just another period of people's life.
