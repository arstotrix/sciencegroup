If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologists Classes, I would make them to learn the postulates of Saussure. To my mind, it is the fundamental things in linguistics. I wish them learn about the linguistic concepts. I would go with teenagers to language expeditions to show them how interesting and important learning languages. I wish I could encourage them to devote their lives to science.
