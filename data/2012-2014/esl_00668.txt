Nowadays the development of science and innovations in biology assure better healthcare and more efficient medical care, resulting in an increase of life expectancy of an average person. However, this benefit of progress can have its negative sides and problems that need solutions.
   One of the main problems for a government is a growing number of retired people. For example, in Russia the retirement age is around 55-60 years, which means in average there are around 20 years of retirement for each person. Thus, the amount of people to be supported by the government is increasing while the amount of working people remains the same, which has a negative impact on the economy of the country. This problem can be solved on the state level by prolonging the working age.
   An important problem that aging people often face is the absence of any occupation once they are retired. Such lack of activity can have a bad influence on their everyday life, making them feel bored and useless. This problem can have several solutions. A government should organize different events, in which retired people can participate, and provide more establishments that can be interesting for aging people, like some interest clubs. At the same time, the families should engage the older generation more in a family life, they can propose such activities for retired people as looking after kids, gardening or actively participating in family celebrations.
   To conclude, the extension of average life expectancy can lead to several problems, both for individuals and the whole society. Nevertheless, with the right measures being taken we can fully enjoy this tendency of the modern world.
