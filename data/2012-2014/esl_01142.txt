Well...
We've read five reviews on three books. Two of them were short and easy to read and three reviews based on the book written by Steven Pinker were long and too detailed.
I believe that it is not because of some of them are better than others, the reason is that they were aimed on different things. And in my case, they haven't reached their destination.
