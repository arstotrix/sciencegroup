The graf presented gives an information about the percentage of the income spent on the petrol supply by three groups of people in UK and USA sorted by the amount of their salaries: poorest layers, middle-income layer and richest layer.

The tendency of pertol usage in USA shows that almost all income ranged groups use cars since the poorest segment of American society spends more than 5% of their income on oil. Then the percantage of income spent dicreases with the growth of income and reaches the rank of 2.5% in the richest layer. UK shows differnt tendency as the poorest class seems to use public thansport in order not to spend its income on the petrol as the figuer are aiming to 0%. The higher layers tend to invest more into their own cars as the indices grow and reach its peak in the richest group (4%).

To crown it all it has to be said that the attitude to the petrol wasting in UK and USA among wealthiest and middle-income classes is practically the same, although the poorest class can serve as an marker for the attitude to the public transport in these two states. Residents of UK find using metro, buses and trains more appropriate than residents of USA. This attitude can be connected with the scales that each of the two countries has: UK is small island located state while USA squares are much bigger.
