The gap between parents' and their children's generations stems from lack of knowlege and goodwill from both parties.
I totally agree with this statement. First of all because both children and parents can have different visions about one subject. It does not mean that one of the visions is incorrect, it just about the outlook of each person. Sometimes between appears misunderstanding. Secondly, not all the parents want to understand that almost every person is free and can have some secrets. Parents often get offended because their child doesn't want to share with them problems and feelings. It may sound strange, but most part of teenagers can easier find common language with mature but not very close people. It happens so due to one thing: such person gives you an advice, but never takes it close to his heart while parents try to spoon fed their children.
In order to have better relationship man should read a lot in order to feel like fish in the water in every subject and to feel free in communication with every person. And children and parents should learn to hear each other and to spend free time together. If people learn to be patient, I think the problem of "generation gap" will disappear.
