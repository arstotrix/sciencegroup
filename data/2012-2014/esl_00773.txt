Nowadays an advanced stage of information technology’s development gives a new chance to humanity to create a fresh way of own workplace’s organization.  Computers empower workers to do their work not only quicker and more qualitative but at any suitable place. 
Some people prefer working at home being with beloved family among domestic stuff. Others would like to do their work by travelling all over the world, learning new culture and enjoying different natural conditions. 
As for me, I wouldn’t want my lifetime to consist of humdrum workdays, I would be happy to work with gusto.  The best way for me to achieve it is to travel as the heroine of American novel ‘Eat, pray, love’, based on a true story.  According to the plot, a journalist starts on her journey in order to understand herself. During her trip she is writing the book which provides the tour and in the end she become a happy strong person with a well-paid work.
However, there are still a lot of people who carry on their work in a traditional way. They adore visiting at official workplace and communicating with colleagues. Besides, there are many jobs that demand real man’s presence, for example, hairdressers, builders, bus-drivers and so on.  Such type of work can’t be done with the help of computers.
To sum up, people can work in the office or work outside the official workplace. It is not an easy thing to decide what manner is the best. Any of both ways depends on type of work and individual preferences of a worker.
