Construction of deagentive derivation with dative is rarely used by native speakers and poorly researched by linguists in contrast with various russian constructions, there are no accurate proposition about what this construction is and how it is formed in the speech.

The main problem should be solved is that its structure is not standard  construction and its meaning with non-modal verb has a modal semantics. The course paper consider either there are a generous amount of the modal deagentiv or its number may be limited.
