It is thought that the majority of people prefer to go to cinema and play games bat not to read books, for example, in our days. And there are scholars who want to verify is it true or fouls. I think this diagram can help with it. 
So, we can see that quantity of cinema-goers is more, than one of those who go in libraries or theatres. In first one we have about 70 per cents. At second, we can learn that migrants from English-speaking countries more often go to theatres, but ones from other countries like books more than Australians. Maybe, it is because new migrants have to learn English very quickly. Also, we can say that people like Zoos and Libraries quaintly, but those who born in Australia, more often go to look at animals. 
To sum up, it is clearly, that nowadays people like bright and colorful facilities, but still exist those who prefer to sit with a book in quiet place.
