                     What it would be like now if something hadn't happened in your life.
  In our everyday’s life actually every person was lost in thoughts what it would be like now if something hadn't happened in their life. I am also not an exception.
 I have just closed my eyes and have just tried to imagine how would be my life, if I hadn’t entered the university in Moscow.   If I hadn’t entered the university, I wouldn’t visit Russia and I wouldn’t personally acquaint with relatives. If I hadn’t moved to Moscow, I wouldn’t know what linguistic in new understanding is and how unusual linguists can be. If I hadn’t chosen HSE, I wouldn’t meet Nina, very sunny and close to me in spirit person.
 I am sure that my life would have been different, if I had remained in Chisinau. . I wouldn’t get down to learning Italian; I would keep on learning German. If I finished university in Moldova, maybe I would be moving to Germany after it. If I hadn’t been here, I wouldn’t have traveled to different countries by plane. I would live with my parents now and unfortunately, I wouldn’t realize the meaning of homesick and how much I love my parents, sister and my friends.
No matter what would have happened, if I hadn’t entered HSE. Now I am here and time goes by, that is why I don’t want to live with thoughts about what it would be, if something hadn’t happened. I want to create happy future, not looking back. A person can enjoy present only if they know how to let go of the past.
