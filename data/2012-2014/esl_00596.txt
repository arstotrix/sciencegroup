The graph shows the quantity of plant and animal species extinctions in tropical forests from 2000 to 2100 and the chart provides the information about percentage of threats to plant life.

Overall, looking at the graph, we may see that the quantity of animals' and plants' extinctions is predicted to experience a steady rise from the beginning of the century to  2060, where it reaches its peak of 50 thousands  species. However, through the next decades the index descends to the value which is slightly less than 30 thousands species.

If compared to the graph, the chart may tell us the reasons for such predictions as it gives percentage of threats to plant life. First, it is obvious that human impact predominates over natural events - it concludes about 80 per cent of all possible threads and second, agriculture causes more damage than any other type of threat - just about 19%. 

All in all, looking at both the graph and the chart we may suppose that human impact will cause great damage to the nature, especially by doing agriculture through decades, till 2060. After 2060, though, maybe some new technologies will be introduced that will not influence tropical forests and plants which are used to be consumed will be grown in other special places. Or, maybe, by that time governments will take plans made to save the forests, as our future depends on it.
