In this report I am going to describe a table and a chart showing levels of customers satisfied with the job of the major American airlines in general and with special aspects of air travel in 1999, 2000, and 2007. 
There are some visible tendencies in the chart. The percentage of customers satisfied with airlines’ job grew from 65% to 72% from 1999 to 2007. It comes as no surprise that the ratio of dissatisfied customers in those years decreased by 12%. 
The same growth of passengers’ satisfaction level can be seen in the table. There was no decrease in the percentage of customers satisfied with courtesy of flight attendants, price of tickets and schedules from 1999 to 2007.  The most significant change occurred the sector of passengers content with the price of tickets, it increased from the 45% in 1999 to 59% in 2000 and then to 65 % in 2007. The ratio of people satisfied with courtesy of flight attendants as well as that with comfort of seats grew by 4 % in the period of 8 years by 2007. The only aspect of the flying experience the proportion of customers’ satisfaction with which fell is courtesy of check-in/gate agents. Nevertheless, even that decrease is slightly noticeable as this sector went down only by 1 % from 2000 to 2007. However, the percentage of passengers satisfied with even this aspect has grown from 1999 to 2000 as well as with all other ones.
To sum up, both the chart and the table show the increase of ratio of people satisfied with the job done by the American major airlines from 1999 to 2007. Moreover, we can make positive conclusion from that: undoubtedly, the quality of service of those airlines had really improved since 1999.
