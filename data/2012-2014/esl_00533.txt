These statistics shows the frequency of attendance places. Cinema is the most popular pastime among Australians, but new migrants prefer going to the library. What induces namely new migrants to go to the library with enviable regularity that this king of public places is likely to be more popular than easily perceived films? Maybe newly citizens tend to know about their new 'sweet home', about history and culture of the mysterious for them country that was discovered not so long ago and attract more and more researchers. Books are the easiest means to get information from old sources that are not available online. 
However, native citizens prefer to spend their leisure time at cinemas and zoos.  We can suggest, that education level is not enough high to make people interested in libraries or theatres. By the way, theatres are not popular among all people living in Australia. This type of pastime may be too expensive for common dweller or the theatre as a kind of art is likely to be dying out - we can just think of thousands hypothesis. 
Nevertheless, the fact is original inhabitants are interested in mass culture more than in elite one, and what is for migrants, the situation is contrary. I think, it is because people are not burdened with educational basis.
