Critical thinking is  as one of the important things every intelligent person should be capable of. Of course, many people find it extremely useful to develop this skill. However, there is still a problem in defining and understanding the very notion. Some people see it just as rote learning, some think that the ability  think requires only understanding of the problem. Not arguing that it may be difficult sometimes to understand the material given in class or a particular situation in your daily life, we should agree that it has nothing to do with critical thinking if seen as the main concept of such, not an additional bonus. 
First of all, trying to define critical thinking we should speak of one's ability to analyze circumstances, reflect on them and make a conclusion. For me, critical thinking is something purely practical, something that makes you fully aware of all the possible consequences and helps you choose the most beneficial and convenient way of solving the problem.
