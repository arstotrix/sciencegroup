No sooner had i left the bus stop than my bus arrived.
I had no sooner had breakfast than it was high time to go to university.
I had scarcely breathed a sigh of relief when he gave me a new job.
Scarcely had we came home when phone rang.
We had barely became acquainted when he started addressing me with «you».
I was so exhausted that barely had i got into bed when i fell asleep.
We had hardly started working when he complained of fatigue.
Hardly had we entered home when rain started.
