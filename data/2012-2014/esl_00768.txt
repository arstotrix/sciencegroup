Despite the fact that between 1992 and 1995 there was a moderate increase in the number of graduating students, both female and male, there was a fall of students, who graduated from university in 1998. After 1998, the number of female graduates recovered strongly and reached a peak in 2007. The number of male graduates, in its turn, has fallen slightly again between 2000 and 2001 and then soared and was at its highest level in 2007.
It is important to mention that the amount of female graduating students was always higher than of male graduates. Between 1992 and 2007 the number of Canadian female and male students, who finished university, increased from 100 0000 to 150 000 people and from 70 000 to approximately 100 000 persons respectively.
