There is no doubt that is becoming increasingly popular among people, as the only thing they need to do shopping is Internet access. But does online shopping really prove to be a great advancement of people’s life?

Some people believe that the opportunity to do shopping online is a truly important improvement. Firstly, buying things via Internet saves time. People do not need to waste hours standing in a queue or wandering around numerous stalls trying to find some item. Moreover, online shopping is convenient, as in case of having Internet access people can shop wherever they are. In addition, consumers can choose the exact time of delivery which is advantageous, too. One more benefit is that people avoid different unpleasant situations when they shop online, for example, coming across annoying shop assistants or some aggressive consumers. 

However, there are people who believe that online shopping has negative sights. One downside is a risk of financial frauds which online shopping include. It is difficult to know for sure whether this or that shop is reliable. Furthermore, online shoppers know little about the quality of goods, that is why buying things online is like a pig in a poke. Finally, delivery service adds to the total cost of a purchase, consequently, people spend more money. 

To sum up, although online shopping is obviously a simple and convenient way of shopping, buying things via Internet is doubtfully reliable and beneficial. On balance, I believe online shopping has advanced greatly consumers’ life.
