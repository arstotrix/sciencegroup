Men are more interested in sport than women.
To begin with, people pay a lot of attention to sport nowadays. They do sport, they create different competitions, and they watch it on TV. The question is for whom this hobby is more natural and frequent: for women or for men. I will try to consider this issue.
In my opinion, the point that more men than women are keen on sports is nothing more than a stereotype. I believe that sport is now equally loved by men and women. Firstly, nowadays all sports are unisex, thus, there is no sports that only men or only women can do. Moreover, even professional sports of all kinds are now available both for men and for women. Secondly, sport is an integral part of a healthy lifestyle, which is now popular among all people regardless of their gender. What is more, even sport TV programmes are now watched by women as well as by men. 
On the contrary, many people argue that men more often are sport lovers than women. The reason is that women are more interested in shopping, cooking and bringing up children. Thus, they just do not have enough time and energy to spend them on sports.
Although it could have been true a decade ago, I am sure that nowadays things are different. Everything that only men did is now available for women as well.
To sum up, undoubtedly, sports is the most popular hobby nowadays. Both women and men are interested in sport: they take part in different competitions, train a lot and watch it on TV.
