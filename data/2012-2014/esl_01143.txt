A glance at the table reflects some considerable changes in the conventional number of children ever born to women aged 40-45 years which have been happening during the last decade in Australia.

To begin with, it can be noticed that from 1981 to 2006 the percent of childless women has increased by 7.4 %. 
Moreover, there is an upward tendency to having one or two children. The percent of women having two children has increased by 9.3%. What is more, the percent of women that gave birth only one child has uplifted by 5.6%. On the contrary, rate of women that have three or more children have decreased. More precisely, there is a 5.9% drop in the number of women having three children. The number of women rasing up four or more children has plummeted by 16.6 %. 

To sum up, the tradition of childbearing has changed a lot since 1981. The birth number of more than two per woman is nowadays considered as abnormal. However, in 1981 it was more common to have three or more children.
