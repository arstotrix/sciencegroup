The table illustrates the percentage of children that were born to women in their early forties in Australia from 1981 to 2006. It is evident that the columns with 3 or more siblings experienced declines in numbers, whereas having none or one or two kids became more popular during the same period.
To begin, the proportion in the last column fell from about 30% to only 11% or one tenth from 1981 to 2006. Similarly, the relative number of having three children — just under 30% — dropped to 21% in the same period.
However, while these two numbers declined in importance, the opposite was true in the case of having less than three kids or even none. In fact, while only one third of women had two children in 1981, this figure increased to well over 38% during the following years. As for the first and second columns, the relatively small percentages also rose, and numbers in 2006 are twice as much than before.
