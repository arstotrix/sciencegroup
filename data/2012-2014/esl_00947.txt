The growth of online shopping has greatly improved life for the consumer.
In all times people had to buy different goods they needed. Of course, in the past their opportunities were very limited. But gradually the situation has changed: nowadays we have a lot of big shopping centers and small stores. Moreover, with the development of the Internet people began to do shopping online. So, is it really more convenient than “traditional” way?
The main advantage of online shopping is obvious – it helps people to save time. You do not need to waste time on the way to the store and then on the way back home. When you do shopping online, you can look through web-sites of different shops, compare the prices and choose the best one. And all it while sitting on a sofa with a cup of tea and a laptop on your knees.  Sounds more comfortable than being in the crowd of other consumers and standing in the queues, is not it? You also cannot forget about the opportunity to make orders in the foreign stores. Before the emergence of online shopping it was unreal.
On the other hand, this kind of shopping has a number of disadvantages. For example, you cannot see and hold in your hands the stuff that you are buying. That is why there is a possibility that clothes will not suit, food will be not fresh, etc. Also, when you order something online, there is a risk that a delivery man may accidentally damage your purchase. And one more thing about delivery: it is difficult to predict exactly how long will it take, especially from a foreign store.
Overall, online shopping has its pros and cons and everyone should decide for himself, what is more important for him. As for me, the advantages are more weighty that is why I am a permanent client of different online shops.
