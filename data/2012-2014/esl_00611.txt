The charts below show information about types of threats to plant life and current and predicted number of extinctions of animal species in tropical forests.
The tendencies illustrated with the diagrams are strongly negative. They show that the number of extinct species is growing, and there is a plenty of threats which may cause the changes in the environment leading to species extinctions.
According to the forecast illustrated with the first diagram, the extinction speed will rise steadily and reach its peak in 2060, when the number of species extinctions runs up to 50000. Then the number of species dying out per year will start to decrease but still remain considerable.
The second diagram reveals that more than 80 percent of factors which may cause species extinctions are connected with human activity, especially with agriculture and manufacturing. However, not all the species becoming extinct die out because of human impact: extinction caused by any natural disaster is also possible.
