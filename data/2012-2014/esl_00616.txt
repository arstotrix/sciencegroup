The line graph and the pie chart give us information about biological and  ecological situation  in tropical forests: the former presents the number of plant and animal species which are supposed to die out between 2000 and 2100 while the latter shows various threats which can influence  the plant  life. 
The number of plant and animal's extinction will have reached a peak of 50000 extinctions  per million species by 2060. In the period from 2000 to 2050 the figure will see a continuos and steady  rise, however, the extinction will sharply increase  from 20000 to 50000 in the next  10 years. Nevertheless, the situation in tropical forests will become better after 2060. By 2100 the number of extinctions will have significantly decreased from 50000 to less  30000 extinctions per million species.
The factor which can considerably influence plant life is human impact constituting 81,3%. Among other threats, natural events and agriculture have the second highest  percentage. 
Overall, it is expected that the number of extinctions undergoing human impact and natural events will  have the highest level in 2060.
