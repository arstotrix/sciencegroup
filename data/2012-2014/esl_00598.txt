The graph and chart given in the task show us the plant and animals extinctions per million species per decade and potential percentage of different kinds of threats to plant life correspondingly.

The graph illustrates the prediction of species extiontions till 2100. What we can see that from 2000 to 2050 the number of extintions increases constantly and regularly. But the significant thing is that after 2050 the damage of flora and fauna sharply extents to 50,000 extinctions, but on the contrary, in 2060 year the figures of tropical forests destruction goes down.

The chart informates us about the percentage of threats caused by different aspects. In most cases (81.3%) human impact is the reason of plant and animal species becoming extinct. The major factors that influence on nature are development, 10.4% and harvesting, 14.4% while agriculture is measured in 18.7%. 
Human impact should be compared to natural influence, that is only the eighth part of human damagable activities, on plant life because the former is much less than the first one. 

The diagram is the consequance of the pie chart that shows the real present of our planet, if the humanity do not pay enough attention to environmental issues. The only reason for species extinction is a man, that can be seen through agriculture, development, harvestiong and other human impacts.
