Person-centered approach in the interior design.
The bond between environment, a man-made interior in particular, and person's  state is  very important issue which has not been fully disclosed yet. The comprehension of influence which the simplest geometric shapes have on human's state could enrich this field of knowledge. By-turn, this influence could be researched by the exploration of human's perception of different simple shapes (such as circles, triangles, squares) which in this paper are named as "spatial archetypes". Using the existing color-psychology knowledge and trying to enrich itin this research  it would be made an attempt to discover some typical reactions on the simplest shapes among different people that means the finding of common perceptions, or archetypes. This knowledge could open  to psychologists and designers an opportunity to create interiors with special goals : to make people relaxed/excited, to control work behavior and emotions.
