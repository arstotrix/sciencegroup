According to the figure, the use of fixed line forlocal calls remains relatively popular during the whole period concerned. The line representing local calls wold form a bell curve with the peak in 1999 corresponding to 90 billion mintes and the lowest points in 1995 and 2002 at around 72 billion minutes.
