​​The figure given shows ​intrnational ​​tourist arrivals over the world between ​1990 an​d 2005​. It is evident ​that almost all countries saw considerable fluctuations in ​millions of arrivals, with ​moderate growth during the ​1990s and ​its intensification during the ​2000s. In stark contrast, however, North American index, though similarly increasing from the end of the XXth century, gradually slipped after 2000.​​​

​Exponentially increasing from approximately ​30 ​​millions of international tourist arrivals in ​1990 to ​60 ​millions in ​1995​, ​index of Central and Eastern Europe then ​changed its pace and ​reached a mere 70 millions by the millenium. This was followed by a period of ​rapid growth​ again​, with ​it ​reaching a peak of ​about 85 millions of people in 2005. 

The ​indices of South America and Sub-Saharan Africa, meanwhile, ​were rising ​together ​​between 1990 and 1995, but in the middle of that period South America's index has lost its leadership, climbing from approximately 7 to 11 millions, and gave way to Sub-Saharan Africa​'s index, which grew​​ from about 6 to 12 millions prio​​r to ​1995.
