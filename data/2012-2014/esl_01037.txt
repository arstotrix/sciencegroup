In this task we were asked to describe the scheme, that provides information on the process of products manufacturing including how and when information can be fed back to change producing process on earlier stages. Firstly, we can notice that not on the every stage we are able to give a feedback to enable adjustment. It can be done only on phases of production planning, testing, sales and market research. We also can see, that from stages of market research and advertising there arenâ€™t any black arrow that would connect them with the whole process. So, we can see that things referred to advertising can be relatively freely changeable. I think, the diagram can help producers to plan better the production process and control the flow of fed back information.
