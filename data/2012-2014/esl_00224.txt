Animals are our younger brothers. Birds and beasts are all around us. People have pets in their houses and enjoy to be side by side with them. However, some humans prefer to get a profit from animals. They get meat to satisfy their needs, they buy fur coats to get warmth when the weather is cold. Living that way seems natural. However, not all humans live such a way. Some protect rights of the animals.
On the one hand, it is natural to use resources that animals provide to us. Our ancestors did exactly the same thing. They used animal's meat as food, fur as clothes and bones as building materials. Since that time people haven't changed a lot. Most of the humans see animals as one of the ways to satisfy their needs. Some of them even kill animals for their own pleasure or money. People do everything even break the law of the God only to get profit of any kind - whether it is meat or money.
On the other hand, animals are a part of our life. When humans kill animals they break a part of the ecosystem. That is a reason why people should protect the rights of the animals. Birds and beasts are live creatures. They are like humans. Both people and animals want to live. Animals have the same rights as humans do. They can kill people to survive. People do the same.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the rights of the animals should be protected. Animals are not the only source of food and clothes. Humans can get everything for their needs from the environment. However, they should use its resources evenly. Moreover, nowadays people can get everything in its artificial variation. Humans have lived eating artificial food and wearing coats with artificial fur for several years. According to that fact people can live with animals side by side and use artificial products.
