Nowadays many businessmen believe that space tourism is a natural extension of today's worldwide tourism industry. They say that space flight will be much more popular than worldwide travelling. Indeed, this has not happened yet, but a lot of activities are taking place in the world today to make it come true. 
First, space tourism is officially open for business and, what is more interesting, despite that fact that the tickets cost a huge amount of money, some people have already been to cosmos.  These trips are the beginning of the development in this sphere. There are some companies that have already invested great sums of money and are planning to build special vehicles and even orbital spaces. In my opinion, space tourism will be in demand, because a lot of things, for example, aircrafts, were firstly created only for certain purposes and were not available for everyone, but later has become an integral part of all human lives.
In addition, flying to cosmos may help to study space. With the help of space tourism, we can build an infrastructure in space and radically decrease the launch costs and, furthermore, a number of orbital facilities will rapidly be constructed. However, some drawbacks of spaceflights are also found.  Past research tells us that spaceflight causes changes in the physiology of the human body and the consequences of this are not known yet. Moreover, space tourism can have major consequences for Earth's climate, such as temperature rise at the poles, reducing seasonal ice cover there, because of the huge amount of incompletely burned fuel that will be absorbed by the atmosphere. Nevertheless, all this also could be a stimulus for the scientific development and finding solutions to such problems.
To conclude, the space tourism industry is on the verge of taking off that could lead to some new scientific discoveries and development.
