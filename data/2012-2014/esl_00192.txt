Some people think it is more important that cities provide cheap housing and facilities, while other think that it its worth spending money onbuildings that look beautiful.Nowadays, there are many ugly houses in cities which mar up the sight. If the government spent more money on design and decorating, the look ofthe city would be more beautiful.I think, there is no unique solution for this problem. All countries have different levels of life, so the government should take into accountall living  conditions and needs of people.From the one hand, there are countries where lots of people  live in villages and do not have even electricity, water supply system or othernecessary things. Therefore, it would be better to spend money on elementary needs and on providing housing.From the other hand, there are also countries which already have big cities with good living conditions, developed industry and infrastructure,so there is enough money to provide not only necessary facilities but  also make new buildings look beautiful.Another point is the mentality of people. In some countries like Italy people think much about look of thinks while in other countries likeGermany people appreciate first of all high quality and reliability of items they use in everyday life. Certainly, I do not mean that all peoplein one country have identical mentalities but there are still some common traits.In the conclusion, I would like to say that every country should choose its own way to solve this problem and to achieve its goals, becausesituations in the countries are unique and sometimes the differences can be very strong.
