The possibility of working outside the workplace given by development of information technology allows people to work everywhere they want. However, do the strengths of this mobility outweight its weaknesses?
	First, looking at the situation from the viewpoint of working at home, it is a worthwhile idea if your current job does not bring you enough money or when you are a busy student that wants to have own pocket money - it could be an additional source of income because usually it is not well-paid enough. Working outside the workplace is also a perfect idea to those who are physically unable to reach the office. 
The weak point there is that work-process-unfriendly environment outside the workplace seduces person from working and the work is done worse as a result. For example, the discipline is disturbed in cases of feeding the dog, playing with the cat or having some snack freely available in the fridge unrestricted.
	Second, considering pluses of working while travelling, higher extent of mobility helps not to digress from any significant issues related to work during business trips. But the minuse could be there is that sometimes when you travel it means you are on holiday and there is no time and place for work.
	To sum up, working without being attached to the workplace is comfortable for those who need additional source of earning money and those who can work disciplined and responsibly. One of drawbacks that can outweight its advantages is that such work is usually not well-paid in comparison with traditional work process.
