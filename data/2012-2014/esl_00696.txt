Unpaid community service is a very fascinating topic to talk about. This volunteering is a kind of necessity for our society. One the one side, we can help people without waiting for any reward, so that help us to develop our sence of respect or humanity. On the other side, no one wants to work for free. So there are different points of view according to this question.
Some of these people think, that community service is necessary in high school programmes because children become adults in this period of time, so it is necessary to teach them to be worthy. If they work for free they will learn to respect the labour of other people. That is one of the main point.
Other people think that working for free will not help their children because volunteering is a special activity. Some people do everything for free just because they enjoy the process of helping. So it depends on the human and his desire to work and help.
I can not agree with them becase in this age the child does not know his desires. If school gives such an ability to work you may use it. Each experience is first-rate in such an age. there were a lot of situations when the child did not want to do something, but after doing it, this activity became all his life.
Some people also talk that community service is a kind of punishement for prisoners, that is why they do not want their children to be like in a jail.
As for me, helping to other people can not be a punidhement. That helps to bring up the respect to other people. It does not take too much time but it gives you an astonishing experience.
As for me, unpaid community service is extremely needed in a high school because it can give all the indispensable experience to your child. I think everybody shoud try everything in his life.
