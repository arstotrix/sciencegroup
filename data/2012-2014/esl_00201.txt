The bar charts illustrate the waste disposal, the amount of investment in it and the complaints received from 2008 to 2011. It can  be  seen  thenumber of complaints was increasing throughout this time, despite of little decline in waste production.At the beginning of the period, in 2008, the quantity of waste  produced  accounted  for  800  00  tones.  The  charts  show  dependence  betweeninvestment of money in the sphere of waste disposal and the quantity of waste left unused.  Thus, the more money is invested, the more  waste  isrecycled(?). However, this method could be considered ineffective in 2010, when, money was invested equally to  2009,  but  the  waste  producingreached its peak.As for the complaints from the residents, they haven't experienced a decline during this four-year period. The appeals were gradually  increasingfrom 35 000 up to 60 000 every year.In addition, even though from time to time the sum of invested money has been raised, still there was increase of  complaints  from  inhabitants.Local authorities should take care of waste disposal.
