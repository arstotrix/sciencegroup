There is an opinion that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school. there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of both points of view. In my opinion, it is really better for children to learn foreign languages in childhood (at an early ages).
First of all, teachers can use different games for children. These games can help to broaden vocabulary and to draw children's attention to this language. A child will think that it's a pretty fun to learn foreign languages becaus it will be a kind of entertainment for him/her.
Secondly, scientists have already proved that as younger you will be when you start to learn an another language, as easier it will be for you. That's why children remember different information easier and better than adults. Moreover, children have their own associations with different words. No doubt, it will help them to improve their knowledge and to learn language better.
I have a relevant example from my own experience. My cousin is 7 years old and he learn french now. He is absolutely sure that it's very funny to learn how people from other countries name different things. He thinks that their words are uusal, weird and sometimes too complicated for him, but he likes to play games using these new words. He imagins that he arrived from France and that he helps his family and friend understand him and his "strange" words. He tries to explain everyone what exactly he said and adds which of two languages (Russian and French) he uses.
From the other side, I have and uncle (the father of this boy). My uncle wants to know foreign language bt it's very hard for him to learn words, understand the grammr and so on. Of course, it's a kind of challenge for him but it's still too hard. He becomes very angry when he forgets something.
To sum up, I want to add that it's really very useful to learn foreign languages. Moreover, it's very important to begin when you are a little child.
