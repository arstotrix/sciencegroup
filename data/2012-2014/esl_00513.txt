The table shows the places visited by dissimilar groups of people living in Australia. As we can see, there are four kinds of places that are presented in the chart; they are: the zoo, the library, the theatre and the cinema.
Firstly, we might notice sufficient difference in data about cinema in comparison with other places. Namely all people from the chart tend to show preference for this site, as locals constitute all the 70% of visitors, new migrants from English-speaking countries about 65% and migrants from other countries 50%. This makes cinema the most popular place to go in Australia as compared with others. As opposed to the theatre, where the largest number of visitors belongs to migrants from English-speaking countries and equals approximately 24%. It is interesting that new migrants born not in English-speaking countries go to the library more often than other migrants and what is surprising even more than natives. The last ones constitute about 37% while the first ones almost 55%. However, they are less likely to visit the zoo, contrary to the locals and migrants from English-speaking countries, who are actually the leaders of this way of spending time. They compose 50%.
To sum up, we observe how different places can vary in popularity. It happens because of  various factors like topicality, necessity and costs. Which is logically, because, for instance, going to the cinema is more convenient than visiting a theatre.
