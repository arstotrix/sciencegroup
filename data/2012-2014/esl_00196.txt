Risk is a noble deed, as the Russian proverb says. But is it really so? People's opinions on this question vary and  it's  impossible  to  definewho is right because both ways have their pros and cons.Some people prefer taking risks and express it in different ways. Some of people limit taking risks with some field. For example, there are  lotsof extreme sports fans who love to tickle their nerves. These activities, as they claim, help them to reduce stress  through  experiencing  sharpfeelings. Other people prefer speculating in shares, which also includes risk. Some other people, however, do not limit taking  risks  with  onlyone field and risk all the time.  Such people have a bright and fascinating but unstable life as they risk losing everything all the time.Most people, nevertheless, prefer living without taking risk. They explain it  with  the  desire  of  stability  and  fear  of  losing  somethingimportant. These people, of course, have less danger to fail in something and stay short of cash or without health or something  like  that.  Butat the same time they will not be able to reach the success and escape the vicious circle of monotonous boring life. Some  people,  anyway,  lovestability so much that they afraid their life to turn even for the better.As for me, I respect people who take risks and are not afraid to change their lives. I would love to be like them but I'm afraid  I'm  not  braveenough. If only I had more courage I would take risks to change myself just like people who inspire me do.
