The 2006 statistics for cargo traffic at international airports make interesting reading.
Memphis Airport, the top-ranked airport, didnâ€™t increase its ranking between 2005 and 2006. Hong Kong Airport , however , did not change position: it maintained its second position, handling 3,5 million tonnes of cargo and increasing the volume by an impressive 5.1 % in comparison with 2005.
Similarly, Frankfurt Airport , ranked seven, maintained its position. It transported 127,797 tonnes of cargo, an increase of 8.4 %. 
There were dramatic increases in cargo traffic at Dubai Airport (ranked 18) and Beijing Airport (ranked 24).At both airports, there was a rise in volume of over 30%.
On the other hand, Hartsfield-Jackson Airport dealt with just 746,500 tonnes of cargo. This was a disappointing performance, with freight down only 2.8% from 2005.
