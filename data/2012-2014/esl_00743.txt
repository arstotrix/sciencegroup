One of the most valued possessions of our family is a small wall hanging - a carpet with badges of Soviet times pinned to it. The tradition of collecting pins began since my grandmother was able to travel around the USSR, a few years later after being graduated from the University. As souvenirs she has been often buying pins with symbolics of every city she visited. So, decades later the collection consisted of dozens of items! And nowadays, the collection includes pins dated years since sixties to early nineties. For example, there is a pin devoted to XXV congress of Communist Party of the Soviet Union and, of course, a pin with Olympic bear from Olympic Games of 1980. 
My mother in her young ages was wearing some of them and so do I now. I think it is great that such things are not lying in the far corner of forgotten box and I can use it whenever I want. All of them are of great value not only because every pin is a rare thing, maybe even unique, but also because all of them help us to maintain with our past, the past of our country which everyone should have in remembrance.
