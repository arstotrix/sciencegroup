Globalization has its pros and coins. On the one hand, globalization makes our life easier and economic goods more available for people. Connections between companies from different countries help to get something any country lacks. The understanding of the process of globalization lies in the ability to make more goods and get more money. On the other hand, globalization is not that perfect as it may seem. The fabricating industry causes environmental problems as more and more factories are built. Moreover, globalization leads to financial problems and unemployment, because firms try to hire predominantly cheap workers.  In my opinion, the disadvantages of this process are huge, because we don't know what to expect in the nearest future.
