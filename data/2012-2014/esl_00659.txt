The diagrams provide information regarding the key stages in the erosion of a promontory.
The very first stage is destruction of weak zones by water. When rhis process applies to a large area, a cave appears in a headland. After that, a cave becomes an arch. In the world there are a lot of such arches, that is very beautiful and unique, like the Golden Gate in Ukraine.
What happens next is demolishing of an arch's root. Water continues to beat against headlands, finishing to separate rocks from each other.
Finally, when the erosion is done on particular area of a headland it keeps to destroy other parts of the rock that are close to water.
To sum up, the erosion is very long process because it is not an easy thing to ruin something that is so strong as stones are.
