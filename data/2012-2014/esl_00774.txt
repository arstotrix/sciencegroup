Nowadays we are all living in overall Internet access time - from Tibetan mountain temple to tiny African village - everywhere, where one can find people, he will more likely find a wi-fi . This fact undoubtedly affects lives of millions of people, the main question is whether the affect is positive or not.
In my opinion, the cardinal virtue of distant working is a chance to both travel and be engaged in a job - in other words, to see the world during somebody's pleasure. It is known that in the past century the amount of journeys made by human has sharply increased and in the present century one can afford himself to go as far as he likes not only on one's vacation.
Another significant benefit is spending more time with friends and family as the shortage of face to face communication is an important today's problem. And those, who are able to map out their time without taking into account nine compulsory hours in the office every day, will have more facilities to solve the situation.
The only weak point is lack of the working discipline which is significantly more difficult to maintain while constantly changing the surroundings. From the other hand, this provides a good opportunity to develop one's self-discipline.
To sum up, I would like to underline that due to changes made in our world by the World Wide Web each person has a possibility to live a more impressionably reach and eventful life, which is a great advantage.
