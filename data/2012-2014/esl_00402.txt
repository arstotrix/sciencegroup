    Despite the fact that dative constructions in Russian language have been repeatedly described in different papers and so many times discussed, this subject is still not fully explored. In fact, this type of constructions is a sort of impersonal sentence. And the main problem of such sentences is actually to determine the subject in them. It is known that a great number of linguists have been making attempts to define this concept and its characteristics however no universal definition has been made by now. Thus, linguistics still fails to postulate one of the easiest notions for a native speaker. 
    For "Dative constructions in Russian" course paper the goal is to classify old constructions and simultaneously find new ones. In a word - updating. Though, it is not the main purpose of the project. Due to the fact, that this theme is, indeed, quite vast, the course paper's topic is converged to examine one of characteristic features of Russian dative constructions, namely, subjectness. Thus, the project must contain some results of the study, specific facts about this notion, its nature and characteristics in particular.
