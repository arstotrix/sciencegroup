One night I got a call in my department from a man reporting on a car accident involving two cars that took place near Fleury on the way to Paris. He claimed himself to be driving behind the collided ones and stopping to help right after the accident occured. I ensured him that we would send assistance and insisted on his staying with the involved ones. Then I showed professional interest in number of injured and need of ambulance. The man reported on total number of the involved and explained that none of them have any sign of injuries, only little shock. He promised to look after them and noticed that the traffic is blocked by the crashed cars. I reported that assistance would arrive in 10 minutes and thanked the man for the call.
