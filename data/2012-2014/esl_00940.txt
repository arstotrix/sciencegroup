No sooner had she begun to relax than holidays were over.
Hardly had I got home when Ben knocked on the door.
Hardly had they went into the classroom when the bell rang.
Scarcely had we reached the bus station when the bus arrived.
Scarcely had he went into the cafe when it began to rain.
I had barely tried to explain all when she didn't want to listen to me.
We had barely finished our meal when waitress brought the bill.
