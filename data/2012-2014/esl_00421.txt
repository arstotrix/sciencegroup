Typology studies and classifies languages according to their structural features and tries to describe and explain the common properties and the structural diversity of the world's languages. A significant amount of typological studies are devoted to subject-verb-object positioning and morphosyntactic alignment (like distinction between nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive languages). Therefore, there is a need for more particular and objective research that would provide the basis for revealing universals, regularities and patterns.
