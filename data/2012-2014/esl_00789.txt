Outer space has always been something mysterious that amazes mankind at all times.  But only now with a great number of modern technologies humanity has truly a real chance to conquer space.
It is a common knowledge that space explorations are very expensive, too labour and time-consuming. Unfortunately, since the time when Yuriy Haharin, a russian cosmonaut, made a first step on the Moon, in the space exploration’s world has happened nothing really significant. Thus, maybe space travel are made by dilettantes would open a second wind for the scientific world. 
Space tourism is going to be a very luxurious and hard journey. On the one hand, without any doubt, a potential space tourist must be rich and ready to spend a lot of money for such trip. However, money is not the only one aspect that is necessary. Another demand that is more important is that the tourist has to have an excellent health and should be very smart. In space a body should withstand heavy duty and in the case of new discovery during the trip the tourist ought to act intelligently. 
On the other hand, such travels would be extremely dangerous for the tourists and professional team that would escort them and maybe even for all humanity! What if a non-professional person makes a step that brings us not forward as did Haharin’s one but backward. To avoid such disastrous consequences the tourists would have to have a serious training, even then it’s not an easy to say whether it could be enough, because cosmonauts are training the whole life. 
All in all, in order to see space from space not from the Earth people should overcome too many obstacles. For now space in our dreams appears more realistic than possibility of space travel.
