Modern people spend considerable part of their life in so-called "virtual reality". This reality becomes a constituent of the contemporary lifeworld; therefore it affects the personalit, world view and value. 
The problem of human interaction with virtual reality is commonly considered from the point of view of negative impact and addiction. But this paper intend for looking at the matter from a different standpoint: being in virtual reality is a natural phenomenon for modern youth and it is significant in their everyday life. Thereby the following hypotheses are advanced in this phase of research: 
- the senses of activity in virtual reality are similar to the personality senses in real life; 
- the senses of activity in virtual reality  supplement/compensate/substitute the personality senses in real life. 
Consequently the goal of this study is to elicit the various purports of the modern youth activity in virtual reality.
