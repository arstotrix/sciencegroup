The gap between parents' and their children's generations stems from lack of knowledge and good will from both parties.
"Why didn't you clean our kitchen?"
"Mom I was at school" 
"Don't give me that, I saw you playing games!"
"Whatever, I hate you!"
Unfortunately, we can see this situation. We have this problem. But I think we can try to correct it. I don't agree with this statement. Because parents and children, I think, want to be close. But sometimes they only don't understand each other. I haven't this problem in my life, because I have parents who understand me in different or any situations. And I always respect my parent's opinions. In my mind, I think mother and father must speak with their children, together. They mustn't unceasingly oppression their children and give them freedom. And after it they will understand that their children respect them and don't go on the bed way
