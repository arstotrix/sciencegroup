For the last two years Iâ€™ve been studying in the National Research University Higher School of Economics. This university is comparatively young as it was founded in 1992 but still seems to be a prestigious place to get higher degree. When HSE was founded it had a narrow specialization from which the university got its name. However, today HSE is pursuing an aim to offer its students wide range of courses. What made apply to this university was the extraordinary for majority of Russian universities educational system that includes taking part in researches and other extracurricular. Student body of the HSE does not have much in common with other student bodies of Russian universities. Those who study in HSE are ambitious, hardworking and aiming to the future. And HSE by-turn provides great variety of opportunities for the alumni not only in Russian labor-market but in the foreign ones as it has numerous contacts with other universities and companies abroad.
