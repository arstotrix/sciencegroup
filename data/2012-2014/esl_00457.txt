The interesting thing about me
Members of my English group are keen on music, but nobody likes poetry. So, one of the most interesting things about me I compose music and lyrics.
It started four years ago. My best friend ( he is unique, because he is my real friend, I can rely on him) celebrated his B-Day and I decided to present him something special. The song was a great way out. 
That day I realized, it's my way of expression to write music and lyrics. "Wishes come true", but to record my songs I was needed a studio. At first, It was interesting, the process of recording was interesting, thus I wanted to try it by myself. The microphone, some special devices were bought. It was unforgettable: you can do what you want on taste. Every FX element, every part of mastering you do at home. The new era of my songs began.
With every new song I corrected my mistakes and tried to improve the sound. Nowadays, I have enough skills to do a well-recorded and well-mastered songs of mine. My homies like my works, sometimes my dad wants me to download some material to CD to listen it in the car. 
This summer I was invited by the authorities of Domodedovo to take floor on the Town's Day with some of my songs. Despite of speciefic theme of my lyrics, the public was very interested. Before the carnival there were many rehersals, but nevertheless it was very nervous. What I forgot my lyrics? Happily, always was great and I have a success. 250
From this facts, you can learn I'm responsible, sometimes perfectionist. On the one hand, it's good, but on the other hand, it's not so good as it seems to be. Otherwise, the most important steps of my life are done well, I have the aim and I want to reach it at all costs.
