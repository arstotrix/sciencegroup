Globalization makes our age really unique. The mankind has never faced a process like this before. The unknown is always frightening; but aren't its disadvantages overestimated? May be, in fact, globalization is the perfect opportunity to solve our problems, to make our live as good as it has never been before?
My opinion is that there are some troubles, that can be caused by globalization, but they are insignificant in comparison with possible benefits. There is plenty of them. For example, globalization can help us solve the problem of unemployment, low level of people's wealth and even famine in the third-world-countries.  When multinational corporations bring their factories to these countries, they give to local people a possibility of working and receiving money. On the other hand, fast transport and opened frontiers let those people go to other countries and earn money there. Of course, multinational corporations don't let local business develop so fast as it could, but this can be easily fixed by laws.
To sum up, I would like to notice again, that, as for me, globalization is the great possibility to us to help ourselves, and we must use it correctly.
