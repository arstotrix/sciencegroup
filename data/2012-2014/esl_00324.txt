According to Ethnologue there are about 7,100 living languages in the world. Sometimes it is quite difficult to distinguish between a language and a dialect. This differentiation depends on many criteria as the ethnic community a speaker thinks he/she belongs to and how easy it is for 'A' idiom speaker to understand 'B' idiom speaker. According to the goal of the community, some of the criteria could be regarded as more important while the others would not deserve serious consideration. Moreover, the objectivity of the information about the language or dialect and the culture of this people would suffer from this position. Thus, next generations and scholars would deal with the doubtful data and children would study the 'artificial' language at school.      
The importance of the objectivity was decided to be shown by example of the Republic of Mordovia. In this republic the key factors which have defined the portrait of the nation are the general history and language, Mordvinian, and Moksha, Shoksha and Erzya idioms are considered as dialects of the Mordvinian language. Some scholars (e.g., Mokshin N.) support this idea while others (Tsigankin N., Palas S., Shakhmatov A.) argue that there are three different languages. Both of them are overly focused on search for similarities or differences, thus, their descriptions of the language are one-sided. Therefore, there is a lack of modern objective descriptions as one of the most thorough grammar dates to 1984. The language has been changing and the data of grammars should be renewed.
This course paper aims to check whether the descriptions of Moksha explain the items in oral speech of the native speakers. If any additions to the grammars are essential, then new articles would be proposed.
