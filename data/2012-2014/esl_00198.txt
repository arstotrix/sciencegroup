People who take risks are much more likely to be successful.There is a common stereotype nowadays about the successful people: it is believed that only those who are able to take risks can make it to thetop. While we can find some evidences proving this statement, there is to no reason to consider the statement universally relevant to allsuccessful people in the modern world. First of all, success does not require only being brave and risky, but also being gifted, being able to swim like a shark in a constantlychanging ocean of circumstances, having a head on your shoulders and being able to foresee the upcoming consequences of your decisions.Therefore, we can state that sometimes it is much more useful to go slow, step by step and not rush in order to get some benefits. When we are talking about successful people taking risks, we can probably think about Steve Jobs as one the brightest examples. But if we onlyconsider famous people as successful what do we call billiards of businessmen and women that are not so popular or even remotely known over theworld? Most of them succeeded due to a completely different strategy - saving what they have and taking calculated decisions that will not putin risk their reputation and fortune. Therefore, I would not make a rule based on the exceptional cases. And Steve Jobs, for instance, isdefinitely an exceptional case.To sum up, I would like to say that, while in some cases taking risks result in getting an unimaginable benefit, there is no reason to act likea na√Øve maximalist and think that it is a usual thing, for success is not so simple to reach.
