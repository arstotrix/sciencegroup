I read the reviews and can say that I like all of them. One of the reasons is that I like the genres of the works what books were wrote, it is interesting for me. As for other reasons for my passion for that are following. Firstly, authors of the articles tried to open contents of books and they managed to do it. To be honest, the spoiler is not a problem for me, maybe that is why I like those people who wrote that reviews using short retelling. Secondly, texts were made in available for reader language. No terms, no definitions. I think it is very important if the things are clear for the simple people. Finally, I would like to say that that articles were written to carry the reader away. Reviewers wanted to present that books in the best light and to make people read them.
