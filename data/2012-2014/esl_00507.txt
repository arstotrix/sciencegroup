A famous phycologist Meredith Belbin has made a research about the teams. He has discovered nine roles in management teams. Each of them has their good points and weaknesses. All good teams has members with all this roles. At the same time one person can have more then one role, so the team does not have to made from nine people. So if you want to make a good team, you should understand each person's role or roles. After that it is important to use benefits of their character and help them to overcome their weaknesses. If you do not do this, the team can break up or you will not have any success. But if all partners are able to use good sides of their characters and control their weaknesses, the team will work very well.
