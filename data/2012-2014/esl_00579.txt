The young people under 30 tend to be more healthy than other categories in general in 1950 as well as nowadays. About 70 per cent of them have the ideal weight in both time periods. However contemporary youths are much slimmer than their coevals in 50-s: 20 per cent are weighting too little. Two other groups of middle-aged (30-39 and 40-49) were almost similar in the middle of 20th century, not regarding the 5 per cent of obesed in the second group. Today the second group is losting its points in healthy lifestyle, as there are 25% of obessed and the number of people with ideal weight has fallen by almost 20  per cent. Even more threating changes happened to people in the age group 50-59. The number of obessed nowadays is more than 2 times as much nowadays as compared to 1950. The eldest group seems to has the most serious health problems: the number of people with ideal weight fell by more than 5 times.
