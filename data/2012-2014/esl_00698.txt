Nowadays unpaid jobs hardly exist. Many people believed that material benefits is the most important thing in life. Would compulsory insert of community service in high school programmes change anything in our society?
I really believe it would. first of all, many children easily do not know about any volunteering actions or other possibilities to help others, so this insert will show them wide diversity of opportunities. Moreover, it can make a great influence on children' mind and their characters. paid jobs like helping some ill people or cleaning neighbourhood can explain children how to live right and how to communicate with different people.
Nevertheless, making someone do something without their willing, of course, is not so good. All this volunteering activities mean nothing without willing to help or just do something sincere. However, there are a lot of examples in every community of "magic" change in human during making kind things only from heart.
In conclusion I would like to say that this insert will absolutely helps to society, but it should be done with accuracy.
