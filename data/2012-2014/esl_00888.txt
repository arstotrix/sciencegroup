Men are more interested in sport than women

Sport is considered to be mainly a men’s deal. Nevertheless, the world is changing very rapidly, so women are becoming more and more involved in unfeminine activities. Does the interest to sport depend on gender or not? 
If we ask people a question: “Who are more interested in sport: men or women?”, the majority of them will give the same answer – “men”. There are several reasons for it. Firstly, men are more interested in the competition, establishing dominance (winning), and the physical confrontation with others. They want to show their superiority in strength because it helps to identify themselves as “real men”.  Secondly, according to history, physical labor always was associated with masculine participants, that’s why they must have had a good physical shape to survive in hard conditions. What’s more, men can’t afford themselves to express their feeling like women do. So, sport is a way to forget about stress and feel free. 
However, now we live in progressive times and even the basic principles are being discussed and changed despite of the history context. For example, today there are no clear division in what job belongs to what gender. Women can do work of any type, including a power demanding cases. Moreover, now there is fashion for keeping fit and following a healthy way of life. A lot of girls and women are trying to look beautiful and engaging to attract men’s attention. 

In my opinion, men are more interested in sport because they need to attain the sense of unity in-group, especially in team games. The most important thing about doing sport for men is to be brave and confident because then community will treat you respectfully. 
All in all, men are more motivated to do sport due to history, physical characteristics and social opinions, but both women and men are interested in it as one of the ways of spending free time and being in a harmony with themselves.
