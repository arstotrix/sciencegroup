                                 WHAT MAKES ME UNIQUE?     
I think that each person is unique, because everybody has a lot their own individual qualities. Two people can never be similar. So it is very difficult to say, what makes somebody unique. But at the same time everyone has something the most important in their life to live for it. So, when we want to talk about somebody's unique sides, we should discuss their beliefs and main ideas of their live, because only they cause all different qualities of each personality.
As about me, I try to follow the life conception of famous philosopher Ivan Ilin, who said that the aim of human's life is to aspire to the perfection put into the first human by the God and lost during the people's history. Because of that I think that the most important activities are activities that make better your personalities. You can find many types of activities like this, so it is not strange that I have tried only few of them. I like reading and music. I think that reading can give you a very big experience of life and music can show you a real beauty. I am very interested in different literature and musical traditions and because of that I prefer to read ancient or folk literature of different countries. I also like classical and folk music. When I have time I can do some sports. I love martial arts. I am not a good fighter yet, but I am determined and train with enthusiasm. I also like swimming. I can enjoy my life in different ways so I am interested in many other things. For example, I like watching good movies, travelling and communication with my friends. But this hobbies are very popular and do not show my personality a lot.
I know that it is difficult to describe a person in a few words, especially, when it is yourself. Because of that you can find this information about me not so unique. But I hope that during the studying we will know each other better and will be able to see a lot of individual in all our personalities.
