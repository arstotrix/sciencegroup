Some man called me and asked if it was the police station.
He added that he was calling from junction 21 near Fleury on the way to Paris. 
Then he recounted me about the accident involving two cars and he said then that he had been in the car behind them and had stopped to help.
In reply to his words I let him know that we would send them the assistance straight away.
 Next I begged him not to move and stay with the drivers, who were involved in the accident, besides I wondered how many persons had been injured and whether I should call the ambulance. 
After that he stated that there were two passengers and a driver in the first car, and only the driver in the second one.
 Next my respondent convinced me that those four people looked only shocked, but he did not see any other injures. He passed word that he would look after them and said that the cars were blocking the traffic.
Then I promised that the assistance would be there within 10 minutes and thanked him for reporting.
