Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury
It was a pleasure to read.
When I was younger my grandma bought me a book called The Martian Chronicles. I liked these short stories and especially the way the writer talks to readers. It is easy to understand, so kids can easily read his books.
 Since that time Ray Bradbury has become one of my favourite writers. However, I read Fahrenheit 451 about two years ago. This has been one of my favorite books since I first read it. This book has changed my life. It has opened my eyes to the problems in our society. For example, after I read this book I understood that nowadays people loosing ability to converse, but isnâ€™t it God-given talent?
As it is written in encyclopedia Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel. The novel is divided into three parts: "The Hearth and the Salamander", "The Sieve and the Sand", and "Burning Bright".
I think that it is stupid to give a short summary of the book, because it is hard to tell someone about this book without spoiling it. But I'm absolutely sure that everyone must read Fahrenheit 451 and make his or her own opinion about this incredible book. In this book we see the new world where fireman starts fire and books are outlawed.
It sounds weird but in my opinion Fahrenheit 451 isn't just a fiction. Even though the novel was published approximately sixty years ago you get the idea that parts of this story are happening all around us everyday. People prefer surfing the internet or watching TV to trivial human interaction.

 Bradbury described himself as "a preventor of futures, not a predictor of them", and we can easily draw parallels between the book and life around us. I suppose Bradbury wanted to show us what would have happened if people had forgotten what the greatest thing in our lives is.
