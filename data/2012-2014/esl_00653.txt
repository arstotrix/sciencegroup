Nowadays the whole world is united by the Internet. It is impossible to say that a more efficient communication tool has ever existed. However, 
some people think that the Internet may not be the best source of information.
As it seems to me, these two opinions are not contrary at all. While the Internet may appear the fastest and the most convenient way of meeting 
new interesting people and contacting old friends, it is always important to remember that most of the information you can find on the net - on 
Wikipedia, on different forums - is created by half-anonymous persons that take practically no responsibility for their words.
On the one hand, the fact that at least half of all the information on the Internet cannot be considered reliable, makes it a very bad place to 
look for some arguments for your essays on scientific researches. But, on the other hand, the amount of relevant sites, books and articles you can 
find on-line is much bigger than the one even the best library in your country can provide. It works the same way if we talk about communication. 
People generally believe that the Internet is the best service that helps us communicate with each other, make new friends, share our interests 
to the world, but we also know that while the Internet makes it so much easier for us to keep in touch with all the world, it also makes it so 
much easier for maniacs and pedophiles to find and fool their victims and so on.
So, the Internet may e dangerous: the sites you visit may contain lies, the people you talk to may not be who they seem to be, but, in my opinion, 
it does not make the Internet any lees usefull. You just have to be careful and check all the information, check the references and not be gullibal, 
so nobody could fool you easily. It is just like the real life, but the opportunities are worth it.
