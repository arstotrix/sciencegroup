The following paper provides information about art-therapeutic impact on the development of autistic child's ability to relate with something/somebody. Children with autism are not related to their parents or other people as much as normal children are, also they do not objectify their inner world through communication. The visualization of inner world while drawing is a way to create objectified symbols of inner representations. The process of drawing in the safe environment creates an opportunity for building a relation between child and therapist. Autistic children usually do not display emotions; they behave like "their inner mirror cannot reflect". The paper describes a case study about  6-year-old autistic child and his development within art-therapy sessions. A significant change occurred in a 7 month period of art work: the boy started to express his feelings and thoughts through art. In addition, such a successful ending of therapy corresponds with parents' and school workers' supportive setting to that boy.
