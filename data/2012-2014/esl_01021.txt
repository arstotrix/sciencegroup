Architecture is the Mother of Arts.
Somecall it the "Mother of Arts." Others call it an unnecessary extravagance, but architecture is, in fact, experienced by anyone living in the built environment. There is only one professional trained to create it: architects.
Engineers and builders may have the technical knowledge to assemble the parts of a building, but only the architect has the training and years of study in aesthetics and experience coupled with talent to design buildings that have some value as art.
Architecture is what people create between the given forms of nature and the structure of our own physical body. They put ourselves “into” their buildings and they affect our environment as they work back upon us.
One of my favourite archtects is Antoni Daudi. As we can see he drew in nature the inspiration for his works. It is really hard to describe his buildings: you shold better once see it. After first time you'd seen this, you will absolutely will fall in love in his works and will be dreaming of visiting the one more time so do I.
I think, that Architecture is the Mother of Arts because people started creating environment for life earlier than other art objects.
