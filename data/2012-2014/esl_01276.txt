In my report, I am going to describe two graphs providing the information about the level of satisfaction with the job of major national airlines in the US in 1999, 2000 and 2007. There is a bar chart showing general satisfaction levels and a table with percentages of satisfied with specific aspects of flight.
It can be clearly seen that the main trend in both graphs is the increase of the number of satisfied people.  As concerning the bar chart, we can see the growth of the percentage of satisfaction of 4 percent between 1999 and 2000 and of 3 percent between 2000 and 2007. Moving to the table of percentage of satisfaction with specific aspects of flying experience we can notice two points that don’t match with the main tendency: the first one is the courtesy of check-in and gate agents and the second – the schedules.  In the first case, there is a slight decrease of number of satisfied people from 89 in 2000 to 88 percent in 2007. In the second case, the level of satisfaction rests the same in 2000 and 2007 and is equal to 79%. 
The most important growth can be observed in the category of the price of tickets it increased to 79% by 2000 in comparison to 45% in 1999, continued to grow and reached 65% by 2007. 
Overall, we can see an abrupt increase of nearly all indexes during one year between 1999 and 2000 and then a slight growth until 2007. It also needs to be mentioned that in general more than a half of customers are satisfied by the job of national airlines.
