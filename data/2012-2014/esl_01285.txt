Sometimes people ask themselves “What if I were another nationality?” or “What if I were 

someone else?”. But how often do we think about how would we see the surrounding world if 

we had another native language? It is no doubt that our language affects on our behaviour, 

change our worldview and the way of thinking. An experiment with English and Indonesian 

speakers can show us some explanation of this fact.

As we know, Indonesian speakers generally choose two pictures with one man but different 

activities as the most similar. Thus the result shows that in Indonesian language the main focus is 

on the nouns and we can assume that Indonesian speakers try to remember the event and the 

participants at first. This assumption suggests that Indonesians love people, they are very 

hospitable. We can think that Indonesians often pay attention to the details.

By contrast, English speakers choose two pictures with different men but similar activities as the 

most similar. We can suggest that in English the main focus is on verbs and adverbs. This 

suggests that for English speakers actions are more important than participants. We can suppose 

that English speakers are more pedantic, they love coherence and teamwork and for them the 

most important is the final result but not who and how do it. 

Therefore we cannot decisively talk about the correlation between people’s worldview and their 

native languages. But nowadays more and more experiments and researches give us interesting 

results and opportunity to see this liaison and study it more tightly and deeply.
