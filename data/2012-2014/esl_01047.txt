The table illustrates the number of children born to women aged 40-44 years since 1981 to 2006. As we can see, in 1981 most women preferred to have two children, and this tend remans stable from year to year till 2006. This index reaches its peak in 2006, 38.3 percent of women who had two children. However, the minimum measure has remarkably changed. In 1981 minority preferred to have the only one child(7,6%), in 1986 and 1996 this percentage gently increased (8,7% and 11,3%), but still remained the smallest one and in 2006 the situation has relatively changed: the least number of women had four or more children(11%), and quantity of women with one children became slightly bigger(13,2%). So, number of women who have four or more children have considerably declined (from 27,6% to 11%), number of women with three children is a bit hesitant(we can notice a tendency to reduce, and the number of women without children risen slightly (8,5% to 15,9%). To sum up, average number of children born to one women has decreased because from year to year more women accent on work and carrier,but not on their family.
