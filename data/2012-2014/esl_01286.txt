Some people believe that children may start formal education at the age of 4, while others do not agree. So, let us consider both opinions.
To my mind, small 4-years kids are not mature enough to enter school due to some reasons. First, children at this age are not disciplined enough to attend school classes and they can easily get bored by spending a few hours sitting on the same place, learning or doing something. Secondly,  not all the children at this age have concepts of the most common things, so they cannot even understand the explanation of basic rules and etc.  Personally I started school at the age of 7 and so to me it was easy to feel myself comfortable in the school atmosphere.
On the other hand, undoubtedly there are always highly talented and very smart children, who can easily manage with formal education even at the very small age. So it is just a waste of time for this kind of children to wait until the age of 7 or 8 to start school.
In conclusion I can say that it’s up to everybody to decide whether to bring their children to school early or not and it undoubtedly depends on kid’s skills and talents.
