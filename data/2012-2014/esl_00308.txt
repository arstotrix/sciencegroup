	The constructions with a repeated preposition (e.g.  к сину к своему к Иска[ку]) is a widely-spread and well-done documented phenomenon in Old Russian and was described in detail by such works as [Зализняк 2004: 145-147], [Klenin 1989], [Worth 1982]. Though the repetition of preposition remains in the pronominal constrictions and is not an infrequent occurrence in the Modern Russian, there is no comprehensive description of it in the literature.
This corpus study considers the frequency of occurrence of the repeated preposition in pronominal constructions, examines the constructions where a preposition tends to repeat more frequently and explores the factors which cause the preposition repetition.
	The constructions under the research are formed by combining the following elements:
1. one of the most frequent Russian prepositions given in [Грамматика-80] 
2. one of seven Russian personal pronouns (я, ты, он/она, мы, вы, они)
(3. a repeated preposition)
+
4. the second pronoun (один,  сам, каждый, все)
	The study results indicate that the preposition у and the pronoun все tend to form the constructions with a repeated preposition more frequently than the others. The possible explanation of this fact is the presence of two consonant sounds at the beginning of the word "все": in order to divide the resulting consonant cluster (у нас всех, у них всех), the preposition у is inserting before the second pronoun (у нас у всех, у них у всех). However, other possible factors might be at play.
