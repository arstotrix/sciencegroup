The Russian National language is supposed to reflect diachronic and synchronic states of Russian language. To fulfill this aim it should be balanced, which means that no text type should overwhelm the others at any given period. The first part of the present work describes the statistics of the RNC texts ratio across decades through the general csv-table and special graphs for every text type. This statistics is made automatically using Python-scripts especially constructed for the purposes of the current work.  Then texts ratio is evaluated in terms of balance. The basic ground for evaluating is the comparison of Russian corpus and the Brown Corpus (The Brown University Standard Corpus of Present-Day American English) which is considered to be a standard of a well-balanced corpus.  As the research shows considerable inconsistency between text types percentage across decades, the final aim is to invent a method of simple corpus-balancing. The last part of the work presents an automatic balancer. It is a Python-program which takes a csv-table with periods of balancing and the perfect percentage for each one and produces a table with recommendation on adding tokens of every text type in every period. This program will help RNC creators to correct balance gaps and make the corpus become a reliable resource for linguistic research.
