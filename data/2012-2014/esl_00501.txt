Hello, Georges!
In your last letter you told me that you would study in Russia next year and you asked me how could you cope with culture shock. It's difficult to me to give you advices because I never faced with this problem. The only thing I can do is tell you a few things about Russia that may seem to you strange. I hope it will help you, because if you'll be aware, you'll not be shocked.
First of all, traffic congestion in Moscow are terrible, so be ready to spend hours trying to get to the university.  More, there are many troubles with transport connection: sometimes you have to wait 30-40 minutes for the bus.
People's behavior can also shock you. Russians may seem to you unfriendly, self-contained and gloomy. But I think this is our way to be polite: Europeans, when they want to be polite, aim to say by their behavior "I'm your friend", and Russians - "I'm not your enemy, I don't touch you so don't touch me". But when you'll communicate with one of us face to face, you'll realize that we are not hostile at all.
