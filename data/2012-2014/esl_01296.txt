To begin with,a narrator reminded that Scotland is located at the top of the island of Great Britain, resembling the crazy hat by the bearded laughing troll. He also mentioned that on thursday the 18 september the people of Scotland would vote to decide whether or not it would become a country on its own rights. Whereat the narrator asked if the Scotland is already a country. He told that technically Scotland is a country within a country. The speaker admitted that Scotland has it’s own church, it’s own legal system, it’s own professional sacrilege and so on, but it is still a part of the UK, which also includes England, Wales and Northern Ireland. He remarked that The Scotland did used to be a separate country with its own king- James the Vl, but in 1603 queen Elizabeth the 1st died without living an heir, and that’s how James the Vl, her nearest relative, became James the 1st of England- this fact was quite interesting to me, because i didn’t knew about it before. So, after that narrator reported that England and Scotland coexisted together before the acts of union in 1707 which maid the two nations a single entity with one parliament located in London. After a small musical pause the speaker said that in the 1970 speculation about devolution, the notion of returning the measure of power to the Scottish government, outgrew into the West Lothian question. He joked that for most people in the UK the real West Lothian question is: «What is the West Lothian question?»
To sum up with the issue of the West Lothian Question everybody wondered that Scotland could vote on laws that affected only England and had no vote on matters that affected Scotland. The narrator stated that after referendum on devolution they did set up a Scottish parliament. (He explained that devolution is not the same as being a separate country.) So he concluded that the real question was whether would Scotland be better as an independent country or not and the answer was: «nobody knows».
