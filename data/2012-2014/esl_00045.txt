Though collective bargaining was fundamental for the British employment sector in the 20th century, since the 1980s the interest to the tacit settlement between employers and employees has lowered significantly. The hypothesis of the present paper is that the collapse of collectivism was caused by  growing market competition. First, the article presents a general overview of the changes in collective bargaining,  particularly, in the private sector. Second, the causes of retreat are explored, more specifically product market competition and the profitability of separate industries. In conclusion, the article analyses the implications of privatization.
