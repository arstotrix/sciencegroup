Every national corpus is supposed to be representative, i.e. its data should cover a wide range of spheres of a national language. In order to become a reliable resource for linguistic researches, a corpus should be balanced. A corpus is considered as balanced when the distribution of its texts across time or text types matches some predefined percentages, usually determined by the creators of the corpus. It means that no text type should overwhelm the others at any given time period. For instance, texts on medicine should not make up 80% of all texts. The best example of a balanced corpus is the  Brown Corpus (The Brown University Standard Corpus of Present-Day American English).Usually, text types are defined by the following strategy. Firstly, all texts are divided into two main groups: fiction and non-fiction literature.  Secondly, each group is categorized by its own criteria. For fiction literature these criteria are genres: poetry, love stories, detective stories etc. Non-fiction literature is split by domains: press, medicine, technology, education, etc.  
The Russian National corpus is a collection of Russian texts. Each text has meta tagging: the information about its creation, author, genre, domain and topic. As making the RNC balanced is too complicated task for one person, the goals of this work was not so general. The first aim was to monitor the percentage of each text type across decades for the twentieth century. The second one was to evaluate the ratio of RNC texts in comparison to the Brown Corpus. The last one was to figure out how many tokens of which genre or domain should be added to each decade to fulfill the needed percentage and to make a list of such recommendation for RNC creators.
