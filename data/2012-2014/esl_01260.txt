What would it be like now if I hadn’t changed my mind in two month before the previous summer and hadn’t decided to study linguistics?
Since both of my parents’ work in some way is related to economics, when the time to make a decision what would I do in the future came, I haven’t really take it serious. That’s why last school years I’ve spent on studying different social sciences. But, fortunately, not so long before State Exams I’ve collected myself and thought over what do I really want to do in my life. And sometimes I ask myself a question: what would’ve happened if I hadn’t risked then and didn’t try to enter the linguistics. First, I think, I wouldn’t have met all these amazing people who are surrounding me now . Beside that,probably, I would have understood how boring economics is and would have give up studies at all to have a gap year. That’s why I could have had much more time to sleep, which is not too bad, but quite boring. I also wouldn’t have discovered such an interesting science as linguistic. To sum up, it was a good one decision and now I’m quite happy with it.  It’s good to have a chance to make a choice or change mind in the last moment, because if someone doesn’t have such a chance it may lead to many missed opportunities and regrets.
