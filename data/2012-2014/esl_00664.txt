Nowadays there is an increase of average life expectancy, especially in developed countries, where is a tendency of ageing of population. Although serious problems have arisen as a result of this, there are solutions. 
   One of the first problems of the increase of average life is overpopulation which was caused by raise of birth rate. Together these two increasing processes provoke such results as shortage of consumption, resources and free space. For example, because of overpopulation majority of developing countries suffer from dearth and famine. Another important problem is necessity for governments to pay oldage pension longer than earlier. This cause lack of money for different social needs as supporting students and young families, payments for invalids and others, and also provide high taxes for younger workmen.
   At this moment governments of many countries are interested in finding solutions. The most efficient for the first problem are using alternative resources, development of farming for consumption and relocation people to the countryside. This will solve dearth and depletion of resources, and let people to live more loosely. For example, such new resources of energy as sun batteries and wind energy supply many people with electricity when other types of energy are not accessible. Second problem with pensions demands decreasing of pensions and raise of working age. Young people would not be burden with high taxes which do not let them to be in progress. 
   To conclude, there is no way to stop the increase of average life expectancy, because it could be violently, but there are solutions for problems provided by these tendency. However, this increase is evidence of improvement of quality of life.
