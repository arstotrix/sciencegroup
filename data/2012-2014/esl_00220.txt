The problem of recycling waste is very important for highly developed countries and on the presented charts we can notice the amount of waste produced by UK industries over a four-year period, the level of investments in waste disposal and the number of citizens' complaints. In 2008 the amount of waste producing was on the level of 800,000 tones and the total investment in waste disposal was 1 million Euros. In the same time, there were 30,000 complaints from the UK population. In 2009 the total amount of waste dropped to 700,000 tones, while the investment volume raised to 1,5 million Euros and the sum of complaints also increased by 5000. The data says, that a year later, the number of complaints became 50,000 and industries' waste production reached a peak of 1,200,000 tones, but the investment stayed on the same level. Finally, in 2011 we can notice, that the waste production went down to 1,000,000 tones, the investment in waste disposal reached a peak of 2 and a half million Euros, but the number of complaints also extremely increased to 60,000. It looks very strange. 
These contradictory data can say about an ineffective way of spending national money. The investment in waste disposal increases each year, but there are no visible effects of it. This can be caused by the business corruption and the government of the UK should pay more attention to this gainful area.
