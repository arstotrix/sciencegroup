We live in a century when from year to year the number of new hi-tech opportunities is getting bigger and bigger. There is a great deal of state-of-the-art technology nowadays. It is considered that all technologies were created for making our modern live easier and more comfortable. However, there is an opinion, which spreads all over the world, that because of new technology people are becoming more helpless and uneducated. There are two points of view. 
On the one hand, there are so many things which became so easier for us: laundering, keeping food fresh for a longer time because of refrigerators, even to make a cup of coffee from coffee-beans at home is not so difficult today. What about navigators? It is the most useful thing nowadays. No matter where you can find yourself, you will always find the way back.
On the other hand, it is so terrible that we are becoming more and more reliant on modern technology. We are starting to lose all our bearings, life experience such as direction sense. Moreover, all these technology influences on our health greatly. If things go on further, we will lose all our inner skills in the long run. 
Evidently, we are becoming addicted to modern technology, to easy life, to laziness. It is not what we have to expect of our future. We have to change our life-style, try to put down all things around us to experience and bear it in our mind to prevent a flatness of mind.
