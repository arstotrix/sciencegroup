In the first part of Stephen Fry's linguistic-focused radio programm the main object of British irony is gender in language. Mr. Fry takes us back to 60's, when women found themselves oppressed language-wise.
As we all know, in patriarchal societies long ago women were not even considered human. It took a large leap for the human society to give women the same rights men have. This recognition was somewhat equal to the freeing of black people.  In females' case, however, there is a huge leftover of the ancient ways in modern culture, and language is no different. It was, however, the cause of a huge historical exaggeration of how men oppress women, which led to creation of a myth that sexes just don't understand each other. This myth was a source of Stephen Fry's fun n' pun through the programm, a remarkable example of British humor.
But the joke always comes together with the fact, and mr. Fry, together with the invited people of science, comes to an understanding that the way genders use language, from lexic to tone, is determined by the role in the society rather than actual biological features. That's when transsexuals come in - when a people wish to change their role in the society, they change their gender. I think, this was the poorly-covered theme of the talk. I know a transsexual person closely, and the reason he calls himself a boy is only about his role and his personality - he wishes to be a strong governor of his fate, which, in his view, doesn't have anything to do with femininity. The talk coveres none of such things, which in my understanding equals to leaving the overall theme aside. As if Fry had to say at least anything about transsexuals, even though he didn't know exactly what.
But as a retrospective into the problem, the programm does great job as it allows enough insight for multiple views. Which is exactly what you need when you talk about women's problems.
