The interesting things about me

  I couldn't think of no alternative, so I decided to write some separated facts about myself. I can't choose something particular, but these components make me who I am, which means they compose my individuality. 
   Firstly, I'm not a kind of person that will stably strive for something definite for a long time. I get interested in subjects rather fast and easily, but get bored much faster. I've tried so many kinds of sport, circles and classes. For example, once I seriously took up tennis and was thinking of becoming a first-class tennis player of world level. How foolish it sounds now! Not to say I also went in for gymnastic and ballet in a professional way. But once I found myself in our school theatre, and it swept me over. But for God's sake, don't ask me why I'm not in Russian University of Theatrical Art now!
   I went to HSE not because I'm quite keen on Maths or IT as almost each of you, but only because languages have been my best friends since I was a teenager. AndI always had difficulties with learning History at school, but I want to struggle with it so that I could say one day: I KNOW THIS SUBJECT from cover to cover.
   Then, I'm averaging once a week try to communicate with somebody who is much older than me to gain in experience and someone lower to become a little bit kinder.
  Moreover, about 2 weeks ago I became obsessed by an idea of getting a tattoo and having my hair cut, so that I would have about 5 cm above.
   I have also an addiction to taking photos of the sky from the 14th floor of the house in my hometown. But now it's impossible, which makes me fill devastated.
   And after all, one story about me which would be awfully funny if it wouldn't be so sad. Once I swam in La Manche at night, which was in Bournemouth (on the south coast of England). After this "race" I completely lost my voice for 3 days.
