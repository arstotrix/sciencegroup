Nowadays high speed of the technological progress, improving of life quality inevitably influences people's dwelling. One of the things that has been changing simultaneously with the civilization's spreading is the increase of a life expectancy. 
At first sight, lengthening of an average life duration may seem a positive consequence of the civilization but it causes a lot of problems in fact. Firstly, the process of ageing of population leads to the augmentation of the diseases which, moreover, are becoming more and more resistant to the existent therapies. Secondly, if the life expectancy increases, the percentage of the aged rises too — this fact obviously means the shortage of young and efficient population. Finaly, aged people usually demand special conditions and care which forces the government to undertake for their wellbeing. It causes some extra-expense and, as a result, economical problems.
In aim to shorten the destructive effects of the icrease of a life expectancy several solutions may be proposed. Primarily, new medical programms should be developped for making the process of treating more effective; besides, doctors should work over  preventive measures that are useful in the conditions that modern world offers and are helpful in avoiding some of the most frequent diseases. Furthermore, it may be reasonable to lengthen the working period — to allow people work longer and, cosequently, make the quantity of the retired ones smaller. This action will lighten the government's burden without reducing pensions. Moreover, it is essential to produce some social strategies in order to improve demographic situation, to lift the birth rate and to make the life and work conditions more friendly for the youth.
In conclusion, it may be stated that such a difficult problem as the increase of a life expectancy requires careful considaration. However, I am convinced that measures offered above could be beneficial.
