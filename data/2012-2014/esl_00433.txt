In my opinion to have a friend at work place will cause some problems.
At work you should focused on business and if you have a friend there it will draw your attention away from business. Because always you will talk about your weekends, holidays or just about others business partners, gossip.
To talk about career, if you and your friend are on the same step of career, it is normal that after some time somebody of you will go up and another will stay on the same place. Of course it may cause problems in relationship. And in the same time one may put obstacles in other's friend way? Not to grow up in career.
Friendship at work place could impede your progress in career. Because in some situations you may think that it could offend your friend. Or you may think it will make misbalance in your friendship.
Talking about advantages having a friend at work place, of course they are existing. Friend it is support, and when you have some problems, you can always ask for help or for some advice. It is more comfortable of course when your friend is here, maybe on the next table.
Real friends should have different job or business. They should support each other and your interests shouldn't be crossed on money. Real friendship is often born since childhood and goes with you through all life.
So in my opinion it is good when you respect, have the same sense of humor with your business partners but not more.
