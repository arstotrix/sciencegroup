Our history is a great example of endless changes that have been happening to our life. This process of modification is natural and it covers many fields. 
Thus, it is easy to see that many old values are replaced by new ones. Many things are interpreted differently nowadays. One of the examples is shopping.
It is known that shopping was a routine domestic task in the past and today it is considered as a hobby. I personally believe that this alternation is a good one. 
Unlike the past people today can spend a lot of money on clothes and other things, feeling the pleasure in doing the shopping. It happens not only 
due to the wide choice of goods but because nowadays people can afford it. Shopping became essential part of lesure time.
However, I am sure that there are people who have another point of view. Their opinion may be caused by unwillingness to spend money on doing shopping. 
Another reason is that many people do not enjoy shopping at all. They consider buying things as a waste of time and money. It is also known 
that women like doing shopping more than men. That is why fathers, husbands and other males hate accompanying women while shopping saying 
that it is irritating and useless process.
To sum up, I agree that shopping as a hobby is a positive trend because it has many advantages like gathering friends together and enjoying 
the process. All in all I am sure that only we on our own can choose the way we spend our spare time and noone can judge us for our choice.
