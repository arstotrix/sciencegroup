Each language has its own structure. But not always we can reveal this structure without being 

native speakers. To learn and to study structure of language - this is the main task of the linguist. 

But what should the linguist do if he isn't familiar with language at all? And the answer is: to 

experiment.

We will consider in more detail experiment which was made by Lera Boroditsky. Indonesian and 

English speakers would be shown photographs of the same act in a time progression. They are 

then asked which are the most similar. Interesting feature of this experiment was that speakers of 

English paid attention to the action, and speakers of Indonesian paid attention to the object 

making the action.

This experiment interested me, and I asked myself a question: what this experiment might reveal 

about the worldview that English speakers and Indonesian speakers have? I decided to look up 

the information about the Indonesian language on the Internet. Unlike English, Indonesian verbs 

never change to express time what explains a choice of speakers of Indonesian, most Indonesians 

simply do not bother to mark time when they speak. Knowing it, we understand that for 

Indonesians the main place in the speech is taken by an Argument (fr. actant), but the details are 

not important.

This experiment makes us closer to understanding of structure of the Indonesian language and 

society in general, make us feel difference between English and Indonesian worldview. 

According to this experiment Indonesians' language structure cues their attention. If you need to 

figure something out to put it into words, then you pay attention to those details; but if you don't, 

you don't.  This experiment helped us to see a huge difference between Indonesian and English in 

which details play an important role in the speech.
