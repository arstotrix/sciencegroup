Gender issue has long been part of disputes. So, Stephen Fry starts his program with distinguishing notions of sex and gender as being biological and sociolinguistic. With the first seconds we go back to the 60's where it all began. We hear old program where the transformation of being called 'man' to 'person' was derided by Ronny Barker and supported by funny examples like modification of Dustin Hoffman to Dustin Hoffperson. Moving on we hear Sue McGregor complaining about the attitude towards women. So that when a woman was asserting herself she was taken for a terrorist and considered as a threat to the society. Men and women use language differently so that we can discover some stereotypes. When a man says that he likes yoga it means he doesn't have muscles and when a woman says she is not upset it means she is very, very upset. There is also a stereotype that women are weak due to the fact that men are much more powerful when talking. And professor Jennifer Coats wanted to challenge this perception which was spread in many studies. It turned out that women use a lot of laughter and jokes, they tend to be unconstrained, while men are inclined to discuss success and heroism. However, it is still difficult to choose the first cause of such domination between power and gender. The difference between men and women is enormous and it becomes apparent not only by what words they use but how they use it. Hence, we learn stereotype intonation: women's high rising terminal and men's calm tone of stating the fact. However, as we can learn, TRL have no tendency to be a gender distinction. All in all, language is not the telepathy, so we can surely affirm that we will never truly understand another person, just as the thing that gender directly affects our mutual understanding.
