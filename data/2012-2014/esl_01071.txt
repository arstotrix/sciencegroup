In this report I am going to describe an algorithm showing us what stages are gone the customer goods before they emerge as finished products for sale.  Also we can see on this table the process of the information feedback for enabling adjustment.
In the first instance, need to say that all raw materials and manufactured components are kept in the storage. After the withholding from the repository they are passed to the production planning stage. On this stage it is decided how much the stored materials will be processed to create required quantities of goods. In addition, making finished products is done in parallel with another process: the product research which dictates the requirements of the design. In the next place, goods pass the stage of assembly and then they are inspected and tested. After these steps products are ready to be packed and despatched for sale. According to the table market research is also very important part of the making products process which affects the advertising and design of the goods. These components play a significant role in fostering future sales.
Thus we can see that making finished goods for sale is a rather big and complex process.
