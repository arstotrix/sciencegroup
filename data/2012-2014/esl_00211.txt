Today as the conception of consumerism passed through all the spheres of human life the vast majority of cultural values was reexaminedincluding sport as well. Some people believe that such changes are harmful to the spirit of competitiveness. However, others consider sport tobe the fortunate investment.On the one hand, such attitude to sporting competitions might arouse public's interest as far as affaires connected with money always attractmuch attention. Moreover, the amount of money invested in sport may improve the conditions provided to athletes.On the other hand, today sport appears to be not the contest between sportsmen but the battle between sponsors and the struggle carried on isnot for the achievements but for the customers. Sport today turned into a large industry that brings an enormous income to its owners. More thanthat, sport is a way of improving health and keeping in shape but as a result everything turns otherwise when the things are somehow related tomoney. Some sportsmen get injured and even die for the sake of getting an achievement and thus making a fortune. What is more, money spent onsport could be invested into more serious issues and even solve them.In conclusion, I would like to say that according to my vision of the world sport is a very useless activity. I find investing money into such apointless occupation even cynical although sport has some advantages that can't be underestimated. The spirit of the competitiveness wasdestroyed long ago when sport changed into a job; competitiveness turned into greed.
