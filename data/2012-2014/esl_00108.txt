Censorship in mass media.
One of  urgent sides of journalism that is widely discussed is censorship. There are lots of arguments both for controlling ofinformation delivered to people through mass media and against it. Some people consider that journalists should be given full liberty of speech, others however think that free information with  censorship at all can hurt people's feelings.
More and more people nowadays tend to believe that censorship is  no use. Sometimes such an opinion grows into belief that any control over information is bad for masses. I, however, cannot agree with this. In special circumstances, like during the war, in order to keep the military secrecy and to prevent the leak,  information offered to people should be strictly controlled and screened. In such cases censorship is essential. But such restrictions, in my opinion, should only come into force in situations where information leaks can damage the safety of the society. In other cases, like in  attempt to hide the truth about the political situation in the state (what happens in Russia now) leads to no good.
Another widespread opinion about censorship is that censorship doesn't help to solve problems in the state but hushes them down. This point quite has sense to me. I also consider that besides 'usual' censorship as we understand it  there is a kind of hidden censorship when a stir is made around  quite insignificant events. When everyone discusses something like that it's highly possible that more serious events and deserving attention pass by unnoticed.
So, in brief, censorship is sometimes necessary but it shouldn't be overused. Its main purpose is to protect, not to delude. The latter, unfortunately, happens quite often and that's the reason of negative attitude towards censorship.
