Animals have always been a part of life of human. Without their help a human would has not been able to farm or to do housekeeping. So humans and animals began to live side by side. But ever since the industrial revolution the importance of animals' labour was getting lesser and lesser. So people were divided into two groups: 1) those who thought that animals were only fit for food or scientific experiments, 2) those who thought that animals had their rights and could not be treated like lifeless creature. 
The people from the first group believe that animals have to help humans to live: give them milk, meat, egg, skin and so on. Also, such people think that they have the right to do with them whatever they want (for instance, run an experiment on them or just hunt them for fun) because they are weaker than humans and a human being is a king of the world. 
The second group thinks opposite. They believe that animals are in the same stage of development like humans so they have the same rights as humans. That's why humans can not infringe upon animals' rights and must take animals' rights into consideration. Moreover, people have to help animals to survive because animals do not afford such opportunities to help themselves as humans.
I refer myself to the second group. I totally agree that animals are breathers as humans. They have the same biological needs as humans. They can think and understand. For example, it was proved scientifically that a baby of human and a baby of monkey develop the same way till the age 2 when a human's baby begins to speak. Another scientific proof is that organism of human does not suit for flesh-food. It takes a great deal of time for human's organism to digest it. So hurting an animal a human hurts himself.
