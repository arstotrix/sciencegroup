The interesting thing about me
Every human is unique. Everyone has his own special features, interests, etc. In my opinion, the most interesting fact about me  is my work. I'm a model.
As I said, I'm a model and I work in modeling agency. A lot of people suppose that it's not a work for man, that it's very specific. But I like it! It's my hobby and the way of earning money.
So, how did I start my modeling career? I started it when I was 15 or 16 years old (I don't remember exactly). I found lots of beautiful pics in the Net - they were amazing! Then, I met one guy who worked as a model. I had a great deal of questions about his work. I asked about pros, cons, charge, timetable, etc. but he said me a little information and I decided to find everything by myself - agencies, photographers, information... I realized that first of all I need portfolio. I found a professional photographer who made my first photos. After the shooting, I signed a contract with my first modeling agency. For the first time, there wasn't a lot of work because I was "unknown" in the world of Moscow modeling. I started visiting castings for shows, video and photo ads, photoshoots, hostesses, etc. The directors and casting managers started to recognize me and invite to their projects. I was working with famous designers like Stefan Orcheld Read and Salvatore Ferragamo, brands like BMW and Volkswagen group. Now I have a lot of castings and work because it's a Moscow fashion week right now and we, models, are very busy.
So, in conclusion I want to say once again that it's everyones' choice - what to do in life and I really like my "hobby-work"!
