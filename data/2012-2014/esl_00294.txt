Abstract to the course paper "Conceptualization of 'pity' in the French language".
Every language has its own unique world of emotion concepts. Some languages may have one or two words for the exact emotion concept, while others have several words for the same concept. It means that across the languages there is no precise equivalent to any emotion term. Emotion conceptualization gives us the idea of different and common cultural features.
The main aim of this course project is to create a database that shows how different emotion types (for example, pity, pride, shame, etc.) are conceptualized across languages. We have to find a general approach to the description of emotion types and their subtypes (for example, compassion, fright, etc.). It would help us to compare as many languages as possible and compose a linguistic "map" of emotions.
This course paper is dedicated to the description of the emotion concept 'pity' in the French language. First of all, we have to find the words that represent our emotion term. Then we will find out main semantic features of these synonyms (for example, depth of feeling, reason for it, etc), and defining similarities and differences we will divide them into groups. As a result, we will give the description both for the whole concept and all the parts of it. After this our results for the French language will be compared with the data of the concept 'pity' in the Russian language.
During the study we use The New Explanatory Dictionary of Russian Synonyms; most of the examples are taken from several corpora of the French language and VISL project. 
The study indicates that in the French language we have the dominant general word 'piti√©' which can be used in different situations. Then, we have three more words representing this concept that differ from each other in several semantic features. 
To sum up, this course project may help to fulfill the small part of the database of the emotional types across languages.
