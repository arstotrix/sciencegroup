The bar charts given show weight assessment of inhabitants of Newtown in 1950 and 2010. We can see the most noticeable feature that is a decrease of ideal weight from young to elder people.
That feature is more noticeable in 1950 than in 2010, as ideal weight decreases from 65 to 42 per cent over the age range. The most important difference between 1950 and 2010 is in the percentage of obese people. The 2010 bar chart shows continuous and steady increase of obese percentage over the age range. In the contrary, there are not so much people who are obese in the 1950 bar chart.
In addition to previous facts it is obvious. That the situation with the number of underweight people is strongly opposite. In the 1950 bar chart percatage of underweight people is more significant than in 2010 where these kind of people are almost absent. 
These bar charts present that the older the man is the more obese he is.
