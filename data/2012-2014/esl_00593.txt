The graph shows the probability of species extinctions in tropical forests from 2000 to 2100. The chart gives information about different threats to plant life which can be caused by people or natural events.
The graph grows from 2000 to 2060. That means that the number of extinct species is expected to increase and it's going to be the highest in 2060 (50 000 extinctions per million species). Such a situation can be explained by the harm done to those animals and plants. In most cases it's human's fault (81.3%) that concludes agriculture (18.7%), harvesting (14.4%), development (10.4%), logging (9.7%) and other less damaging human occupations. These are the most common threat. Natural events such as natural disasters can also cause the extinction. According to prediction the percent of instinct creatures is about to reduce after 2060 and in 2100 there is going to be left about 30 000 extinctions per million species. This could be reached by cancellation of the most harmful things produced by people.
