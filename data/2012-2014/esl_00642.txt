Schools are institutions where children learn how to interact with others and apply your skills for everybody's benefit. While the education systems seem to be able to cope with different kinds of children groups, there are still great problems with educational process. The main one is peer pressure, or plain bullying, in my opinion.
If we talk about schools with different kinds of children studying together, which in my understanding are regular schools, it's easy to imagine how bullying occurs there. If a boy doesn't play soccer, a girl is interested in something "boyish" or anybody isn't as good as everybody esle at math, they are unaccepted. At this point, you view on life is challenged, and such stress, as bullying, may lead to frustration and depression in this period of life, which is not what you want from a school.
However, if a schools consists of students with equal skills, the problem is still there - you may stil be unaccepted for just who you are - your personality, your views, your background. This, however, depends on how many children there are in class. In smaller groups, children tend to stick to each other.
Psychologists may actually do a great job in making the system better. If they are able to analyze students, they could as well give advice to both schools and parents on how to form student societies so that nobody is psychically injured there. While this stays as the matter of future developemnt, however, then schools that focus on specific abilities are slightly better, as they provide children with lesser probability of being bullied.
