These days, it can be difficult to get a good job when you leave a university. There is a wide range of professions and it makes students’ choice harder. Generally, there are two reasons for choosing a job – finance and interests. And people argue which is more important one.
On the one hand, good salary makes people really happy. You can buy everything you want, travel all over the world and provide for the family. In this case, if job is more well-paid than enjoyable, you reduce stress at the expense of money.
On the other hand, having an interesting job is important too. When you like your profession, you want to develop and work with great pleasure. So, you don’t suffer from a stress and really enjoy your life. But if this job isn’t well-paid, there are some problems.
In my own opinion, an enjoyable job is better. As Confucius said: “Find a job you love and you will never work a single day in your life”. When you aren’t encouraged to do something, you can become apathetic and work worse. Everyday routine can destroy your creativity, so you can easily lose your job. As for financial problems connected with
lower salary, there are some abilities to fight with  it. For instance, you can do the other job only for the weekend or freelance. 
To sum up, people should choose job which is simultaneously enjoyable and well-paid. But if it is impossible, as it usually is, I think interest is more important than money.
