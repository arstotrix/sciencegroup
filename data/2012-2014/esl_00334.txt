The problem of communication between parents and children is very widespread nowadays. The cause of this problem is a simple misunderstanding. The world is spinning too fast and one event changes the other, so parents have too many worries about their work and don`t have enough time to speak to their children. This lack of free time arises this misunderstanding, and in its turn misunderstanding arises quarrels and quite tense atmosphere at home. Children, in their turn, usually don`t understand that their parents are humans, not robots. Parents also get tired, and even more than they does. But children don`t think about it and still irritate their parents by their behavior and disorder at home. Everything taken together makes all members of the family upset and irritable. The solution to this problem is simple on words, but in fact it needs lots of patience and real desire from everybody to remedy the situation at home. Parents should try to spend their free time not by watching TV alone, but maybe watching TV with their children (this way worked in the XX century, when the television had just appeared in shops),or going with them somewhere, because first of all children need simple attention from them. But spending their time with the children, they shouldn`t speak about their shortages or wrong things they did, because these topics are good ground for quarrels. Parents should be not angry monsters from the world of adults, but mentors and friends. Children should try to help their parents with work at home by doing such easy, but necessary things as cleaning rooms, washing dishes or even cooking dinner. They should try to be calm and friendly with their tired parents, because quiet atmosphere is an important step for peace at home. And of course, last but not least, both sides should show more often how much they love each other.
