Last night I heard the news on the BBC.
A news presenter pronounced that Egypt declared a state of alert after protesters stormed the Israeli embassy two days before.
Besides he said sadly, that hundreds of people were thought to be missing after a ship sank near the Tanzanian island of Zanzibar with some 600 people onboard.
Also in the sport news I heard that England started their World Cup Pool B campaign against Argentina.
Moreover, an anchorwoman reported that Manchester United's football player Gea insisted that the media had had the right to criticise him after a couple of early mistakes.
Next she told that Gea had made mistakes in the Community Shield against Manchester City and also in their opening win at West Albion. What is more she reported that Gea had come in Manchester Unated from Spain. After that I listened the interview with this football player. He stated proudly that it was normal that things were a bit different, he had new team-mates and football was different from Spain and he had trained just two months with the defence. Then he said that everything would get easier, that he was convinced about that.
