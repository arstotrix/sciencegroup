To create a presentation I've chosen the Dancing Building which is placed in Prague, Czech Republic. As I have already told, my stepsister lives in Prague. When she came there for the first time she was amazed with Prague's magnificent architecture. It is one of the oldest European cities, so its history is full of events which definitely affected on the style and life of citizens. In recent years, especially after the Second World War, Europe refreshed its mentality and developed new 'reality'. That's why there are some incompatible monuments, parks and constructions in Prague. The Dancing Building is one of them. The erection of it took 2 years. 
     Actually, the legend of creating this graceful building made me interested in the culture of Europe and the USA of certain time. Originally it was named Fred and Ginger (after Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers) - the house resembles a pair of dancers. From an embankment of the Vltavy River it looks so elegant and stylish that definitely differs from buildings in the neighbourhood. The house stands out among the Baroque, Gothic and Art Nouveau buildings for which Prague is famous. That was the reason why I decided to know some more about it and tell some facts everyone in our group.
