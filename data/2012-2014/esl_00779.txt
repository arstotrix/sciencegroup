Information technology has become an integral part of our everyday life. With its constant development people now have an ability to do their work at any place if they have notebooks with them. Although this mobility has many benefits, some essential drawbacks shouldn't be overlooked.

Advantages of such type of working are clear. Firstly, it allows people not to waste time in traffic jams on their way to work and back and spend these precious moments with their family. It is even more important for young parents: they can do their job without leaving their babies. Secondly, for some people it is more comfortable to work alone, in their own rhythm, with no distractions on noises of huge offices. Finally, bosses can easily keep the track of events in their offices, while they are out of city.

However, the last advantage may be reconsidered as a serious drawback, because some people are such big fans of their job that they can't stop doing it even during the vacation. It can become a big problem end causes overwork and neurasthenia. Moreover, for many people home is a place where one can rest, have fun and spend time with family and friends. In such case, working at home may provoke stresses and transform a sweet, sweet home into a terrible place, in which you can't hide from your problems and work will always catch you. 

Having said that, I am sure that profits of working wherever you want are far more ponderable than any drawback a working from home or any other place may have.
