The chart shows how types of entertainment differ according to the culture of people living in Australia. I suppose, this chart was built to identify which area should be promoted.
With the percentage of 50, zoo is the place which is mostly visited by new migrants born in English-speaking countries, while other Australian population visit zoo less frequently. On the contrary, library is not as widespread among new migrants from English-speaking countries as zoo, but amount of the new migrants born in other countries reaches the point of 55%.
Whereas the number of theater audience varies between different cultures, it remains markedly low. For instance, the proportion of new migrants from other countries who prefer this activity is 10%.
Compared to the other places, cinema visitors represent the most numerous group, where native Australians are characterized by the highest percentage of 70.
The main trend that emerges from the chart is that, regardless of culture, the cinema is the most popular place to go for all Australian population, while only few people prefer the theater.
