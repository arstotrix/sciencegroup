Hey Josh, 
It's been a long time since my last letter, I'm sorry, had so many things to do. How are you, what's with your university appliance? 
Anyway, let's get straight to the point. I'd like to thank you for telling me about that magazine and it's next issue. Looks like we're on the same wavelength - I always wanted to publish my thoughts about this problem - and now it's a current trend, which is even more popular than racial equality or defence of liberty (those are popular among politicians, though).  I'm pretty confident about my article and I hope it will be published.
All in all, thank you, waiting forward to hear from you.
Take care, 
 Max.
