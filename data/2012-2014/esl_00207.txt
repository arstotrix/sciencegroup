As we all know, animal nowadays are often used for people benefits and there are a lot of heated arguments about it. While some people thinkthat using animals for profit of human is absolutely normal, others consider it as a terrible violation and insist on protecting animals fromthat. In fact, each point of view is rather controversial.Firstly, we must admit that animals are very important in our lives and since the very old times people cooperate with them in many differentways, so we can't live now without helping each other, they need us as well as we need them. In my opinion, nothing is wrong, if we take cowsmilk or chickens eggs and eat them everyday, because, in return, we take care of animals and feed them. The other point is about zoos andsafaris which were made for our pleasure, but it goes without saying that some kinds of animals, especially endangered animals, feel themselvesmore protected in zoos than at large, because their living conditions in zoos are quite good and people make everything to protect them fromextinction. But it is important, that whatever we receive from animals, we should try to give them back their invaluable aid.On the other hand, some of the ways we use animals are really brutal. We use them to test chemicals, medicines and cosmetics and this is a greatexample of our inhumanity to animals. We should reduce the number of experiments now and later renounce them at all. In the modern world thereis no place for such cruelty and with development of scientific progress we should find other ways to solve this problem of experiments.By and large, we should protect animals from ourselves but this protection shouldn't be fanatical and thoughtless. It is absolutely natural tomake benefits from our animal friends but we should also think about their rights and feelings.
