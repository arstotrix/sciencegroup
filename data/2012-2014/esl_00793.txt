Nowadays modern technologies have become an integral part of our lives. They simplify things and make our existence easier. However, in spite of all benefits, technologies can have a detrimental effect. 
We always use technologies and it makes us dependent on them. People rely on gadgets so much, that they are not able to do some basic things without them. For example, pupils and students can't count without calculator anymore. The same situation happens with learning of foreign languages. For instance, people don't acquire how to write some words, they don't need to do it - Microsoft Word makes it for them. My experience confirms the point of view of many experts and psychologists that our generation is getting bad at learning information. We all know, that we can ask Google in any time and it finds answers of all our questions. These examples support the statement, that because of modern technologies we are loosing the basic skills. 
There is no doubt that such criticism is not urgent for all people and situations. For some of us modern technologies are just usefull tools. Anyway, the problem of superfluous reliance on technologies exists, it is serious and society is already paying attention to it. The power of technologies has already become ridiculed in many anecdotes. For example, Facebook says: I'm so power, people can always stay in touch with their freinds because of me. Google Chrome: I have more power, without me people can't log in the Internet. Computer: No, without me you are nothing. Electricity: Keep silent! I am a boss.
To sum it up, people do over-rely on modern technologies and should be very careful with that, as it may lead to serious consequences.
