There are a lot of people, who are nervous before or while giving a presentation. My councils are: 
1) Calm down! 
2) Use your body language
3) Have repetitions before, it helps you to be relaxed
4) Make a great first impression
5) Do a quick connect with the public, encourage her and you will be on the same wavelength! 
6) Speaks smartly permanently! It indicates you like a man or woman, who knows what he or she is talking about
It the main tips of mine. Read books to enrich your speech! Sometimes it is relevant to have a sense of humor. All depends on you!
P.s. Look at Steve Jobs' presentations, I think he is a genius of public speaking
