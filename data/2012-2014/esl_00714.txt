The Harry Potter’s book is a wonderful escape into the fantasy world of wizardry. This has been one of my favorite books since I had read it. The first book, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone (known as the Sorcerer’s Stone in the United States) introduces us the magical world for the first time. Around a little orphan boy named Harry happen some mystery but interesting things. The child of two magic-person is the most famous boy in the wizardry word, because the most powerful wizard Voldemort could not kill him. He just gave him a mysterious reminder – the lightning-bolt scar, therefore Harry’s true place is at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a magical castle located somewhere in the UK. Harry makes friends with pleasant and smart girl Hermione and funny careless guy Ron, they will stand throughout everything by his side. Together they began their exciting life in the world of magic.  Children discovers a world of enchantments and ghost, they have magic lessons in which they practice sorcery skills. The most exciting for Harry is Quidditch, the competitive sport in Hogwarts School. The student life at Hogwarts is fun and wonderful but strange things happen around Harry Potter . Voldemort is back and wants to kill Harry and capture the Philosopher's Stone, which is supposed to possess the powers of immortality. However, lucky Harry bravely fights with the problems.

Tense atmosphere strikes me as noteworthy, because you do not even know what can happen in a fantastic word of magic. However, there are a lot of moral things in the book. We can see how friendship and parental cares are important for Harry, without this support he could not become a hero.  

This book had been written for children, but everybody knows Harry independent on age. Harry Potter is one of the most popular books, which have ever been written, because it is really readable, unusual and turn-paging.
