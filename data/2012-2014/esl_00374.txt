Dear Friend,
In this letter I want to report you a conversation with my friend Jack.
When we met with him, I primarily wondered why he was looking so depressed. He answered that I knew it (because he has already explained me, probably.)He told with sadness that he had asked Ann to marry him the day before and she had refused. I supposed that she preferred clean-shaven men. I suggested him to cut his hair and shave off his beard. I assured him that if he tried she might change her mind.
Next he thanked me for a great idea and said that if she changed her mind after he just shaved off his beard and simply added that the marriage might not be worth an effort. But then I tried to convince him that he had better try it in any case- after all, he was not losing anything if he looked tidy.
But he replied that he would rather write her a letter, maybe.
I suppose that you'll understand my words and share your impressions.
Write soon.
Love,
Alena
