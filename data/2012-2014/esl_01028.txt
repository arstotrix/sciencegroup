If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologists classes, I would firstly think of interesting exercises that would attract and interest students in my classes. For example one of the most interesting but hard exercises is writing an essay on behalf of an object.
The main idea of the School of Young Philologist to maintain interest to literature and languages, and I would try to make this course as more interesting as it would be possible.
At School of Young Philologist work lots of famous linguists and philologists with great experience in this sphere so I probably would ask them to help me to organize course of creative writing.
To be honest I haven't ever known what School of Young Philologist is (shame on me) and I was just thinking about what kind of exercises it could be.
