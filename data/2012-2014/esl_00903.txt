 Many people think that the most important part in our job is its ability to enjoy us but others do not agree with it.
First of all, as it is said by many famous people, all our activities and undertakings must bring us happiness, so this can belongs to our job. The second reason is that doing the hated work we spend our life on something that we actually does not like at all. 
But some people think differently and they consider that the salary is more important. Their idea leads to the separation of our life in two parts: one of them gives us money and the other pleasure. It is a well-known fact that between two stools one falls to the ground. So is with the job, we go to work every day not to get pleasure but to the money on which we can buy different thing or go abroad and be happy.
In the modern world money is very important part. I think that salary and pleasure from the job are both useful. We must combine our interests and take from life all. It is difficult but human is glad and happy only when his job gives his all his wants: the big salary and happiness within the possible. If one of these parts is smaller than it is used to be human will not be in peace of mind.
In addition, in ideal world everyone has the great job but in real word we must work to reach the balance between the salary and enjoy ability. So, keep calm and try to find it.
