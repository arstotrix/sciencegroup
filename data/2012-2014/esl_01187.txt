Is an aptitude of using words in the right way a thing available only for a few people? Many 

people think that ability to communicate is innate ability, but others do not agree.

On the one hand, history knows examples, when people who hadn’t had any possibilities to 

develop skills became the greatest speakers. For example, Joan of Arc, daughter of a farmer, 

became French national heroine by changing the course of the Hundred Years' War. It seems 

incredible that Joan persuaded Charles VII to give her an army and let her to lead, but the fact 

is the fact. The peasant woman had fantastic communication skill and was able to influence on 

people.

On the other hand, these examples of “silver tongued” people are extremely rare. The great 

majority of people spend years learning the art of communication. Doubtless, the best way to 

cultivate this very ability is to speak and to debate, but in ourdays there is a lot of books and 

there are different sorts of trainings made to learn how to use words in proper way. What is 

more, it's a skill that needs to be trained every day, firstly, because without practicing it can be 

lost and secondly, because perfection has no limit.

In conclusion, I can say that even ordinary, non-gifted people can become famous speakers. In 

fact, only one percent of being a good communicator is a talent, natural aptitude a human born 

with, and the other ninety nine is a hard work for self-development.
