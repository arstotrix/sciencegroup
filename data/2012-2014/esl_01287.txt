Nowadays communication is one of the most important things in our lives. And some people say, that good communicators are born, not made.

Personally I disagree with this statement, because I think that human can develop every skill that they are possessed of. The greatest example of humans willpower is (50) prominent Greek orator Demosthenes. When he was young, he was dreaming of being statesman, but he was a stutterer, and couldn't even think of orators career. However he had overcome his disability and nowadays he is known as one of the most famous Greek political figure.(95)
On the other hand there are people who are suffering from autism. One of the symptoms of autism is speech disability. And great American actor and filmmaker Woody Allen who is autistic is a nice example of person who had become a good communicator, not born.

But some people are considered that you can be only born with communication skill. They expect that some abilities laid genetically and can't be developed, so they are sure that good communicators are born not made.

I think their opinion is not really correct though. Georg VI the king of England was thought by everyone not to become a good communicator but he became the spiritual leader of country and supported people in hard times. 

So I really do believe that people could become good communicator. It is not necessary to born with this skill - if you want to reach something, you'll find way to do it.
