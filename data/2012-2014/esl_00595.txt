The graph and the circle chart below deal with the issue of animal and plant extinction. Graph represents the expected tendency of the species extiction for the following hundred of years in tropical forests and the chart reveals the events that influence the process of exstinction of plant life.

Begining with the graph it should be mentioned that the process of extinction according to the expectations will reach its peak at 2060s and will number 50000 animal and plant species per decade while it was gradually growing from less than 5000 species per decade in 2000s. After the extiction rate will reach the mark of the 50000 in 2060s it will decrease and per se expextations will get to 29000 species per decade to 2100s.

Going on with the chart it should be said that the information given can not the considered relevant since the percentage of threats was not attributed to any year thus any discussions on the link between the graph and the chart can not be considered well-grounded enough. However, it can be said that since the main factor of plant extinction is agriculture it is expected that the main reason of such a high rate of extictions in 2060s can possibly be agriculture as well and the percetage of its influence will undoubtedly increase to the that decade.

Tropical forests represent the area of a greate interest to industries and monopolies since the soil and the climate are rather soft thus the amount of the human impact will evidently increase from 81,3% to the higher rate. Nevertheless, every increase is followed by the decrease and it is hoped that the situation will somehow change to the 2100s.
