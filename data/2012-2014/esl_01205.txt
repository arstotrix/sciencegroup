Globalization is a term used to describe the way in which the world is developing a single economy and culture. The processes of globalization nowadays is inevitable and it cannot be without conflict. Globalization in my point of view has both positive and negative effects.

On the one hand, it has positive effects due to the convergence and reciprocity between rich and poor countries. For instance, many people, who are unemployed in underdeveloped countries, can easily find interesting , well-paid jobs in developed countries. Also thanks to globalization is formed a huge competition between manufacturers of different products, which allows the customer to select the best one. Certainly, the export of goods from countries such as Moldova, not only gives you the opportunity to buy cheaper goods , but also allows underdeveloped countries to keep afloat. Moreover globalization brings people of different nationalities closer to each other.

On the other hand, it causes instability of the economies of many countries and increases the gap in socio-economic development between the two countries. It also causes an increase of migrations, so in less developed cities there is almost no working population and the city does not develop. Besides this, the globalization introduces mass culture that provokes the loss of countries identity.

To sum up we can talk about pluses and minuses very long time. This subject is actual in our days. I think that it will bring benefits, if people are still going to do everything wisely and the governments must carry on competent international politics.
