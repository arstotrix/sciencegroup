Part 1.

The line chart shows which percentage of income people  in The USA and in Great Britain spend on gas.
It is clear to see that the bigger income has a person in the United Kingdom more money he or she spends on petrol. So   an English person from the poorest class spends from approximately 0.5%  to 3 % of their income, while people from middle-income and richest class spend 3-4  % of their money. Controversially,  poorest  class in America spends  more money on petrol than others. Thus,  a person with a low salary gives from  4% to more than 5 % of the income, meanwhile people  from a middle â€“income spend approximately 4 -5 % of their money.  The richest class in the United States of America spends less than 4 % of its income.
Overall, drivers from The USA spend  more money on petrol than people in Great Britain, not depending on their income.
