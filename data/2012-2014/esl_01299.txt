The globalisations changes all spheres of our life. It changes the world economics, and the economics of every country, it change the whole society and our perception of ourselves. It transform the world of every human. 
One of the component of globalisation is the freedom of movement.
Globalisation helps people to overcome the state, national and language boundaries. World just becomes more open because of globalisation â€“ nations mix, resemble each other more and more, and, as a result, they also understand each other better. The number of conflicts decreases since the friend or foe dichotomy softens.
On the other hand this unification has the defects too. The variety is splendid, the nationality is a part of a human identity. We lose a lot of everyday and cultural peculiarities because of the nations mixing. The languages and usages die, as there are no more close  communities, where they were practiced.
