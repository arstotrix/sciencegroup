"Good communicators are born, not made."
I completely disagree with this assertion!
I consider that my position doesn't need a proof, it is simply understandable. More practices mean improving your skills in every activity and work. When we were born we can't speak. Children even don't understand our speech, they just try to repeat sounds they heard and soon little babies give meanings to them. My position can be confirmed by simple example: the story about a boy who grows up in the forest. His name is Mowgli. Wolf and bear become his parents and friends. When ordinary people founded him, Mowgli didn't understand human's language, he could just grow like a bear or a wolf.
If you are going to be a good communicator, you need just be more sociable.
"Your hope for the future of your town"
We live in the wonderful town - Moscow, it is a capital of the Russian federation. The population of Moscow is 20 million people. There are a lot of companies and factories in it. Our town has many cultural monuments.
However, there are two big problems. One is a consequence of the other. Firstly, Moscow is the place where you can study in the prestigious Universities, here you also can find well-paid jobs, therefore there are a lot of those who so desire. Consequently the population of Moscow is growing every day. Secondly, because of a huge number of people there are traffic jams on the roads. You may spend three hours to get to your job or university. It is awful and tiresome.
I hope these problems will be solved in the nearest feature.
