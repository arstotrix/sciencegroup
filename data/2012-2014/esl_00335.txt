It is very interesting to discuss how we will live in the nearest future. Especially there is one interesting theme,  I would like to tell you about. It is about transport. There are lots of films about future and, of course, they show us human's possibility to travel. I think the most interesting and most unreal is teleportation. It is very useful in our real life because we waste time very much on going from house to university or work. On the other hand, people will not have to move at all. Moreover, this transport is hard to create and nobody knows its influence on human's bodies. However, if teleportation transport might appear in our world, it would be the best thing of travelling for people.  And of course we should improve our transport in real world. There are modern trains which speed is more than 400 kilometers per hour. It is not slow and maybe trains' speed would be as fast as airplanes' speed. And as we know trains are cheaper than flights so it is good alternative to travel for all people over the world. The other possible way of travelling could be flying cars. It is very useful transport because we won't need to build roads and motorways because everybody would be able to travel above the ground. And maybe this transport would not use fossil so it will able to use alternative form of power. And I think, it would be possible to travel in space. And who knows, maybe people will live on Moon, for example, so to travel in space must appear. I don't know how it would be looking but I think it is not hard to imagine because many scientists say that mankind won't be able to live only on the Earth. There are a lot of ideas how future transport would be like but the most interesting for me is teleportation and I want to see it in the nearest future.
