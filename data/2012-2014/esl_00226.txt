Sport has always been an important part of human's life. The spirit of sporting competition has always lived in every people's souls. At all times it has been interesting who the strongest, the fastest or the smartest is. But in due course sport began to lose all its spiritual importance and was getting more and more commercial. Some people think that nowadays sport associated only with money, others still believe in an old good sport and spirit of sporting competition.
On the one hand, sport can not exist without money. It is always in need of grounds, pitches, courts, places for training, sports equipments and etc. Moreover, sportsmen have to be paid for their "sports job". Some of them make a good career in sport. And it is normal to earn a higher salary if you are a good sportsman or better than others.  
But on the other hand, sport is not a sport if somebody takes money or wins laurels for cheating. There are lots of examples when somebody pays someone for losing a game or match or does a put-up-job. People even buy seasons game knowing the winner in advance.
In my opinion, people do not respect themselves if they earn money in such way. Integrity of sports competitions must be saved and protected.  Sport for the most part is for entertainment, enjoyment and interest. And if people buy results or cheat during the game, they just defile the spirit of sporting competition and sport on the whole.
