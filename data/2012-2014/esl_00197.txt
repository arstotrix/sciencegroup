People who take risks are much more likely to be successful.It is a common thought that people who do not take risks cannot achieve anything in their lives.In my opinion it is not completely true. Many people who had a major success and created some of the most important inventions of our days didnot risk, they were just extremely smart.Moreover, I believe that the greatest success is when a person creates something with absolute confidence and risks, which are reduced tominimum. It is thought that taking risks brings success, because such cases bring a lot of attention, as something happens, although there wasno certainty it could. However, I am sure that people, who take risks fail even more often, but their stories just do not receive suchpublicity.Another point to be made is that most often when you take a great risk, it is like flying a plane - they fall very seldom, but if they do, noone almost ever survives. So when you decide to do something you are not sure will work, you put yourself in a situation where you might getacross the ocean, which is if you think about it is a miracle or lose everything.Some people might say this is too radical and that some risks are not so crucial, but I do not think that something that can be restored shouldbe considered risky.To sum up I would like to say that the myth about the success that came due to the fact that someone took their chances was created by publicityand has nothing to do with real life.
