We are going to observe typical stages of production of consumer goods that are presented in the diagram. In total 11 stages of production are presented, we will consider some of them in more detail.
The flow of manufacturing process including manufacturing products and raw materials is one of the initial stages of production of consumer goods. The other is creating the production plan with the production research and designing by the producers.
After that, we can see a number of consecutive steps including assembly, inspection, testing, packing, despatch and finally the product goes on sale.
In my opinion, the most useful in this chart is that it is showed the flow of information feedback, because according to the data and the adjustments for improvement of quality and sales can be brought in manufacturing process.
To conclude, I wanted to say that this diagram shows us not only the main stages of production of consumer goods, but the research for a feedback on different levels of manufacturing, which, as I consider,  is very important for development of the manufacture.
