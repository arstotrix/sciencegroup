The table below contains the data about the persentage of different categories of students enroled at Bristol University in different years - 1928, 1958 and 2008. 
As we can see, generally the number of students enroled grew dramatically: in 1928, they were only 216, but in 1958 their number became five times as big as it was it the previous year surveyed. As for 2008, the number of the enroled reached 6377 students.
But if we have a look at the number of female students, we may notice that it fluctuated: there were 42 percent of women entered in 1928, then their number decreased to 32 percent, but in 2008 it rose again. Comparatively, the number of male students reached its maximum in 1958, where 68 percent of the students enroled were men.
The percentage of students from other regions or countries is also worth attention. The number of students from within 30 miles of Bristol fell significantly: in 1928 they made up a half of all the students, but in 2008 their proportion was just about 1-2%. As for the students from overseas, their number, on the contrary, demonstrates steady rise, what is more, the most considerable increase happened in the last 50 years surveyed.
