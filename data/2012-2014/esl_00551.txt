A survey of the visitors of Fairmont Island was made in order to find out the advantages and disadvantages of this place.
As a result, tourists found the island as a very attractive place with nice local public (nearly a third and two fifth of supporting voices). 12 % of people also liked local culture, and about ten per cents of guests mentioned a good accommodation.
On the other hand, the cost of living on Fairmont Island became the least favorite point within visitors - just under half of respondents claimed to dislike about it. The other weak points were entertainment (30% of visitors didn't find it interesting) and weather (which became a problem for a fifth of tourists); also, a few people were dissatisfied with food quality.
As a result, the island seems to be a beautiful place with friendly locals, changeable weather and expensive but comfortable living.
