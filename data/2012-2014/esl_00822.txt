In the interview Noam Chomsky shares his opinion about various issues, most of which are somehow related to politics.  I am not fond of politics that much that is why I cannot argue about this in full measure. However, his words about the lack of democracy in democratic countries caught my attention. I totally agree with him that “there is a huge fundamental defect in the democratic system”. During elections people during elections vote for candidates they do not like at all because there are no other options to choose from. In my opinion, it is a significant problem nowadays. There are certain groups that have occupied the whole “sphere of influence” and do not allow others to develop. All this leads to the absence of competition that, from my point of view, causes corruption and reduction in the overall development. Moreover, it is largely connected with the unconscientious discharging government’s obligations. He pointed out that “..approximately 80 percent of the population said the government doesn't work for the people”. I think this may well be true. Nevertheless, the main problem is that people do not do anything against that because they find it impossible to change a system. So it could be that there is a big difference between a notion “democracy” and how this idea is embodied in the life.
