Iâ€™m not that kind of person who overestimates the significance of the material objects and who can have unchanging attitude towards some things that is why for me it was almost impossible to find the most valuable possession. But the longer the person lives the more material objects he or she gains and once my mother gave me a book that she had got as a present for her 23rd birthday. This book consisted of approximately 800 pages was all filled with the free verses of different almost unknown authors. The verses were great but the book itself was quite nice by touch and even seemed handwarm. Because of its weight it also tended to be sensed as a living being more than as a simple book. And notwithstanding the fact that my writing table is not so big the book of free verses always lies there. This possession is valuable to me not only because of the verses which are undoubtedly magnificent but because of the feeling that I have a book of such great literature works. When I feel tired or stressed I take a book into my hands and just hold it for a second trying to recall some strings from the verses. This calms me down and makes me feel save.
