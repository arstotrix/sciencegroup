    Nowadays in the developed world average life expectancy is increasing, therefore the population is growing rapidly and this causes problems both for society, in general, and for individuals, in particular.   
  Firstly, a large number of ageing people are supported by the state that leads to the increase of taxes for younger people. Secondly, overpopulation can cause the lack of habitation in case of limited territory. Thirdly, appears a problem of a global level namely the lack of natural resources. 
  The first problem can be solved if the retirement is being raised. Speaking about the second problem, people can find solution in opening up and developing new territories and equipping them with necessary facilities for future life. As for the third problem, the solution can be found in using alternative resources such as recycling and renewable resources. 
  To conclude, the increasing of average life expectancy taking place in the developed world leads to a lot of problems influencing the life of the whole human world. However the solutions to all those problems can be found.
