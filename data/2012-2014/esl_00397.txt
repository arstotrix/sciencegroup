Grammatical Profiles of Temporal Substantives in the RNC.
One of the problems people learning Russian as the second language face is word inflection. This problem is particularly urgent for commonly used words such as nouns denoting time periods. The current course paper analyses the data on the word forms frequency of temporal nouns (in this particular specialty, four lexemes утро, день, вечер, ночь) in Russia both independently and in context patterns. The aim of the work is to check the inequality of particular word forms and to make an attempt to explain it. The data for the research was collected in the Russian National Corpus (RNC). The analysis demonstrated that some word forms are approximately equally used for all the concerned lexemes, and some of them, such as instrumental case are used atypically often for nouns, meanwhile other word forms are used particularly rarely (i.e. plural ablative). However, the word form frequency differs when examined in context patterns (mostly with prepositions): words tend to be used in particular contexts with differing probability. This shows that nouns of the concerned group have both common features and differences in their use. However, this question still needs further more detailed consideration which is probably to be made in future.
