The first bar chart shows weight abberation among Newtown people in 2010, while the second bar chart illustrates the weight evaluation there in 1950. On the whole, we can see the extinction of short weight tendency among elderly natives and the appearence of opposite strong correlation between age and adiposity. 
The 2010 chart demonstrates approximately 72 per cents of ideal weight youngsters, whereas, according to the same graph, more older age groups are less and less likely to have an ideal weight, giving way to risingly high level of obese and overweighted people percentage - only 5 per cents of the eldest group have a perfect weight. However, the 50-59 group age has greater segment of ideal weight than 40-49 group - about 41 per cents - at the expense of overweight segment.
The distribution in 1950 is smoother - the ideal weight percentage slowly falls from 70 per cents for 20-29 age group to about 48 per cents for 60-69 age group; the overweight problem appears in 30-49 age group, dropping for 50-59 age and again 60-69 age group. The underweight trend slowly decreases from 30 per cents to 20 and even to 18, but then increases for 50-59-aged to 23 per cents and for 60-69 to 41 per cents. Obesety has rather small percentage in 1950, so it reveals itself only for 40-49 and 60-69 age groups as about 7 percents and for 50-59-aged inhabitants as 10 per cents.
