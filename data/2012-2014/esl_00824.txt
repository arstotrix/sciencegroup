In the Big Think Interview, Noam Chomsky was asked a number of questions concerning several actual problems, such as democracy, policy, healthcare and so on. There is a topic that he has discussed and I would like to give a comment on.
Noam Chomsky gave an insight into the problem of American democracy. According to his words, its fundamental defect has to do with the limited access of population to the power. He says that elections are bought, because candidates have to have a huge financial support, otherwise they do not stand a chance. Therefore, even though 80 per cent of population believes that government works for a very small group of people, they are feeling themselves helpless to do anything about it.
In my opinion, the situation is very close to Russian democracy. Not only the access is restricted by financial requirements, but also the votes are actually bought. The wealthiest parties steal them from those who have not voted or buy them by those who do not care about the results. Moreover, the more urbanized the city is, the more citizens know how Russian elections work. Most of them think that it is impossible for them to change anything.
To sum up, Russian and American democracy are significantly different, but, as many democracies do, have almost the same problems. However, from my point of view, the situation in Russia is much worse than in the United States.
