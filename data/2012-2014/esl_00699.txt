Nowadays there is a considerable debate concerning the compulsity of including unpaid community service into the programmes of high school. Some find it profitable and jstified. Others consider it to be inferior. though there are strong arguments on both sides, I believe that obliged community service would be beneficial.
First of all, compulsory community service will teach student different virtues: not to be egoistic, to cary about other people and about environment, to think about the future of their country and following geerations. If students do such work, the government will get excellent citizens. More than that, while working for charity, improving the neighbourhood or teaching sports to younger children, students will get an opportunity to make new friends instead of sitting at home and playing computer games. Such work can turn out to be joyful ad delightful. People willget same business ad probably they will not sit at home, watch TV and surf in the Internet less. Furthermore, goverment would save some money in national budget. This money could be used to building kindergardens. For example, "subbotniki" in the  Soviet Union helped to clean the area and to cary about environment and probably even to reduce the pollution.
To sum up, my opinion is that compulsory unpaid community service included in high school programmes would be valuable.
