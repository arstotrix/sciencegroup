In today's world the theme of globalization is quite fashionable and of current interest. A lot of radio and television programs, books and articles are devoted to this process. Globalization is a complex process of interaction between individuals and enterprises, institutions and markets, technology and finance, information exchange.  On the one hand, globalization is good for the world economy, because of developing international relations. The world is becoming more connected. On the other hand, the national ideology is violated, borders of sovereign states are blurred, the world's major corporations have a huge impact on the economy. The world is becoming more dependent on these large global corporations. 
I think that globalization is a necessary and unstoppable process, but the loss of national culture and national language, the loss of historic values are bad. Control globalization is not possible, but we need to pay more attention to its processes to not run their course.
