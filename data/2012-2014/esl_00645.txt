The graph and chart below give informaton about extinctions of plant and animal species and threats to plant life.
The graph shows that  since 2000 the number of extinct species in tropical forests has been rising uniformly and it is predicted to reach the highest point, 50,000, in 2060. After that the gradual decline can be seen, from 50,000 in 2060 to 37,000 in 2080 and then 28,000 in 2010 as the number of species extincted will rise each decade, then there will be less plant and animal species to die. 
The chart demonstrates the influence of human activity (81,3%) and natural events (18,7%) on plant life. The biggest damage is caused by agriculture (18,7%) and harvesting (14,4%), then come development (10,4%), logging (9,7%) and livestock (7,7%). Plantations, invasive species and disturbance have the smallest impact on plant life - 4,7% , 4,9% and 5,3% correspondingly. On this chart natural events are divided into two groups - natural disasters (7%) and other natural events (11,7%), totally it is 18,7%, that is 4 times less than human impact. 
As we can see it on the chart, electronics, technics and farming are quite developed now. The further growth of industry will lead to the rise of the number of the extincted representatives of flora and fauna. The apogee is forcasted to come in the middle of the century which will surely change the life of humanity. That is why it is important to care about the environment while we are looking for new devices and trying to reach the high economic performance.
