"The Road less travelled" is the book written by Scott M. Peck, an American psychiatrist. As for me, this book is a real guide book to the whole life.
It suits best for people wanting to reflect and to develop themselves but not knowing how to start. 
It shows the thorny path through the life to harmony, grace and love. Every man can find there the inspiration to move on if they are lost in this world but are ready for the difficult work with themselves in order to find answers on their questions and solutions for their problems...

It teaches universal values that are sometimes forgotten or misunderstood. I believe that every person can find in this book some special issues very important for them personally. I love this book, it gives me much hope, patience and inspiration.
