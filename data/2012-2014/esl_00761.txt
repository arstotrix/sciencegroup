A story of a meeting by chance

One of the most unbelievable meetings in my life took place during my stay in Paris. One day, whilst standing in church I noticed from afar a girl looked like my friend who had been attending with me dance lessons five years ago. I was really astonished when I realized that she actually was my friend! She told me that she had left Russia and moved to France, she introduced me to her French friends, and among them was my fellow student from the University of Sorbonne. I had not seen her for ages, but it was not so easy to ask her about her life because everything had completely changed during this period. She remembered of one of our common friends and told me some news about her. Nevertheless I had only four days till my departure to Moscow, we decided to meet again and to talk in a calmer atmosphere.
