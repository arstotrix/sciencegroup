When people hear the word “art” they usually imagine a painter with a brush, creating a true masterpiece by his accurate movements. Others think about a poet, sitting in his room for the last two days, circled by mountains of dirty paper, and trying to find the ideal combination of words in some two lines of his great poem. Of course, for lots of people an artist is a musician, who can make your heart beat stronger by just few movements of his fingers.
Almost no one will think about a man, who looks rather like scientist than an artist – an architect. But in fact, we face architecture much more often, than other kinds of art. Every building, even the ugliest one, is an architecture product. Sometimes it is Eiffel tower or Statue of Liberty, sometimes it is our own house – it is our daily part of art. We can live without books, paintings and music, but we can’t live without buildings. This is why architecture is the eldest kind of art – we could not have survived without it. Thus, we can easily consider the architecture as the mother of arts.
