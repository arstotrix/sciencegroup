The given table provides information about the statistics for passengars traffic at international aiports by 2005 and 2006.
The top-ranked one, Hartsfield-Jackson International aiport didn't change its position between 2005 and 2006 despite the fact that the total number of passengers decreased in 1,2 percent.
The most significant increase of 18,3 percent  was seen at Beijing International Airport thus it moved from the 15th place to the 9th.
Similarly suvarnabhumi Airport reached the 15th place of the ranking with 42,799,532 passengers and 9,8 percent of growth.
On the other hand the Airport of Roissy lost one position in contrast to 2005 and was ranked the 7th. However the number of passengers rose by 5,6 percent to the mark of 56,808,967 passengers.
It should be mentioned that O'Hare International Aiport and London Heathrow Airport maintained their positions (the 2nd and the 3rd respectively). The number of passengers of both these airports declined, but the decrease was so slight, that it didn't influence the ranking (0,3% for O'Haer Airport and 0,6% for Heatrow.)
To sum up I can say that the half of the airports presented in the chart remained stable, and the most significant increases made the ranking change dramatically.
