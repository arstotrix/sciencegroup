The majority of schools have some entrance examinations which determine entrants' academic abilities. Students are accepted according to the results of such exams because every school wants the students with appropriate level to study there. Of course students may be good in different subjects and to have different well-developed abilities. That means that these examinations are not the best way to appreciate people's knowledge.

Thus, schools do try to select students but they can fail. On the one hand, it is good when the best students study together. It gives a motivation to work harder. But, on the other hand, what about the worst students studying together? They will never develop themselves. If we consider a mixed class which has both clever and backward pupils from the same point of view we can say that most probably there would be enough good students to create a contest and also the bad ones who can look at the best of the best and follow their example. But it can be hard for the first ones and easy for those whose knowledge doesn't meet school's requirements. But every student has the right to choose what is better for him. 

As for me, I don't consider myself as the worst student so I can't imagine myself on the place of such a student. That's why I'm not sure if I would feel well in such a class or on the contrary. It depends on the person. I would say there should be both types of the school: schools that accept all students irrespective of abilities and schools that allow only the best students to study there. It gives a possibility to choose. Every student can try and choose that one that matches his criteria.
