In many parts of the world there is continuous coverage of sport on TV. Some people believe this discourages the young from taking part in any sport themselves.

Today every kind of sport is translated on TV all over the world. Millions of people watch The Olympic Games, football matches and local competitions. Translations on TV make sport more popular and encourage young people to do sports and be healthy.
But on the other hand, people can just watch sport programs sitting on the sofa, eating chips and drinking beer like coach potatoes.  When they see sportsmen, they think sport is too hard and trainings take too much time. So they prefer just enjoy the beautiful picture of competitions.
In my opinion, sport on TV is more useful rather than harmful for young people. First of all, famous sportsmen can become role models for teenagers. The young take up a sport and train willpower and stamina. That leads to self-perfection and knowledge of their physical abilities.
Secondly, when people are watching competitions, they can discover a new kind of sport and find their hobby according to their physical features. Some people prefer weightlifting or running and someone go to fitness clubs or do some exercise at home. In addition, people can make friends in sport clubs.
To sum up, sport translations on TV can be double-edged sword, but I strongly believe that they motivate the young to train rather than just watch. Moreover any sports are healthy for every person who wants to stay young and happy forever. Also sports such as chess or billiards train your brain and logical abilities.
