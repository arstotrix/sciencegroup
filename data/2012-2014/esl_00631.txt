There are two views on selection students to be studied at schools. 

The first one proposes admitting pupils to school according to their academic abilities. It means that those who has better academic abilities should study separately from students which are not as talented as they are. Sure, in such case no one will pull gifted students back and distract and also, possibly, it will help them to achieve better results. But whether it is a good idea for those who does not have such perfect abilities? Very likely that it is not. They will have no example to be followed and as a result of absence of competitive spirit, students with lower academic abilities will hardly improve their abilities.

So, the second idea suggests the solution. Its followers propose students with different abilities to study together. Among its pluses, a competitive atmospere in the class which helps to develop one's capabilities better than it would have been among students with equal low level of their ability to learn. Students compare them to others and try not to remain behind. However, backward pupils are also able to pull back A-students and lower class results and no one will have their abilities improved.

All in all, I think, the constant competition has the same quantity of positive and negative sides. So, the school should decide between those wariants which classes to form, because, why not to give studets with lower abilities a chance to make them better?
