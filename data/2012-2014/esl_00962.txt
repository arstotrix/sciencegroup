There is an opinion that the field of the space exploration develops mostly because of the competition between countries and not due to the international collaboration.
I do not really agree with this opinion. Maybe it was relevant during the Cold war but now situation has changed significantly. The fact of the existence of ISS, International Space Station, speaks for itself – lots of countries put their effort into exploring space, they are ready and willing to cooperate. There is no doubt that we are all very proud of the space researches and astronauts from our native country. But we are as well excited about discoveries and achievements that foreign explorers make. After all, we are all equal in the face of the big and unknown Universe so countries tend to unite and work on the exploration altogether rather than try and outdo each other.
On the other hand, some people believe that national pride is a moving force for exploring space. They tend to think that there is no actual desire to discover something behind the space exploration but that it is only a race and countries try to show which one of them is more powerful. Such people usually disapprove of the amount of money being channeled into the space research because they think it is all just for «showing off». But I believe that space exploration is much more meaningful then just mere competition, it basically seeks for the better future for the human kind.
To conclude, I would like to say that nowadays space exploration is not just an issue for different countries to collaborate on but it is a matter that will definitely unites us all someday.
