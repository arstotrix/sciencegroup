I read the reviews and can say that I like both of them. One of the reasons is that I like such genres of the works what books were wrote, it is interesting for me. 
As for other reasons why I like that reviews are following. Firstly, authors of the articles tried to open contents of books and they really did it. To be honest, the spoiler is not a problem for me, maybe that is why I like that people who wrote these reviews used short retelling.
Secondly, texts were made in language available to the reader. No terms, no definitions. I think it is very important if the things are intended for simple people.
Finaly, I would like to say that these articles were wrote to carry away the reader. Reviewers wanted to present that books in the best light and to make people to read them.
