As far as I know, citizen journalism is becoming more and more popular nowadays and winning its position in the information space. From my point of view, it is a very good kind of journalism because citizen journalists are not paid for their job that is why people who work in this sphere do it just for the society, its protection and covering all events that have happened. I would say that free, unbiased fair reporting are the main characteristics for citizen journalism, the main goal of which  is protection of the interests of the society  and "filtering"  all information in mass media, newspapers , magazines and etc.  The best reason why citizen journalism is good, in my opinion, is that it is independent kind of journalism. So it seems like it is the only type of free press.  On the contrary, there can be the argument that citizen journalist are not educated enough. Partly, I agree with this statement, but I am sure that working  thoroughly and diligently in this sphere, people gain experience and become professionals.
