What might happen to Russian grammar if it was described with English grammatical inventory?
First, we should think, what are most crucial differences between Russian and English languages. Obviously, such are articles in English and grammatical cases in Russian. Also, on the one hand there is a rich system of verb tenses in English and on the other-- aspects in Russian. So, how all that could influence Russian grammar? Probably, what about verb system, there might have been invented a description in terms of perfect and progressive tenses: something like «играет» -- pres. cont., «играл»  -- past cont., preffix- + «играл»  (сыграл, доиграл) --pres. perfect etc.Verb patterns in Russian are also quite different from those in English, for example, since we don’t have gerund forms in Russian, some redundant grammatical description could have appeared(in Russian no difference between ’to try to do’ and ’to try doing’). As for noun system, there likely to appear some idea of article. For example, demonstrative pronouns(этот, тот) could have been considered as definite article and their absence as indefinite one. And case paradigm might would be reduced. To sum up, we can’t know for sure, what exactly would have happened, but Russian grammar wouldn’t benefit from it.
