Essay
There are a lot of linguistic phenomenons such as derived adjectives or properties of inflection and derivation. Today I will speak about «language bias». In Russia this term sounds like «грамматическая калька». It means that one language is described using grammatical rules from another one.
What will happen if we try to use the rules of the English language to describe the Russian language system?
Firstly, there are no any cases in English. Surely, many centuries ago, when English and Latin were similar. There were some cases there. So, it will be difficult to compare Russian and English nouns, adjectives and pronouns. For example:
Мой лучший друг – my best friend
Моего лучшего друга – my best friend
Моему лучшему другу – my best friend
Моего лучшего друга – my best friend
Моим лучшим другом – my best friend
(o)Моем лучшем друге – (about)my best friend
As you can see from the examples, English grammar is not able to describe the complexity of the Russian case system.
Let’s speak about verbs and focus the particular attention on the Russian postfix “ся”, which in English is expressed by the passive form of the verb. For example:
Банк закрылся вчера vs The bank was closed yesterday.
Secondly, English and Russian prepositions are similar (on-на, in-в, etc.). There is some exceptions with derived prepositions, which I cannot correlate with the similar ones in English. For example: несмотря на, в течение, вследствие, etc.
Moreover, adverbs are also similar In both languages. They depend on verbs and do not change. For example: Это выглядит красиво vs It looks nicely. 
In conclusion, I’d like to say that it is impossible to describe Russian language using the rules which are convenient to the group of romance languages, because of the great differences in the structure of the language.
