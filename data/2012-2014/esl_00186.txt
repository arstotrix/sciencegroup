The spirit of sporting competition has been destroyed by the amount of money now associated with most sports.Nowadays the sports industry is developing with gigantic strides. The sports fans spend vast sums of money in order to watch competitions bythemselves and the products advertised by the celebrated football players are bought up immediately. Thereby, most sports are linked inseparablywith a great amount of money, which makes a lot of people trouble about the destruction of the spirit of sporting competition by the commercialcomponent of the industry.On the one hand, this apprehension is not groundless. For instance, the burning issue of the day is the appearance of so-called contractualmatches. The managers and the coaches make monetary agreements about the victories and defeats which each team is suggested to have. Theathletes are forced to obey the instructions of the coach and to play an unfair game. If they have to lose the match, they will playindifferently, with no anxiety to win it.On the other hand, such a big amount of money in the sports industry means the great interest for the sports shown by the people. The money willstop to be received by sports persons in case the competitions become dull and predictable. Therefore, the prosperity of the sports industrymeans that the sports spirit is not dead and keeps on attracting an enthusiastic audience.To conclude, I would like to say that in spite of the activity of the sports managers, which is sometimes unfair, the sports spirit is not underthe threat of distinction at all because of the keen interest both of the sports professionals and the spectators.
