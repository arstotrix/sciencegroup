In some situations people have choice between two options - to take a risk of doing something which has unknown consequences but can lead tosuccess or to abstain from possible benefit but also to preserve probable losses.In my opinion, the problem of necessity and admissibility of risk can not be solved definitely as there are some situations when someone shouldtake risk and other situations when he or she should not.The first type of situations is when people choose something what is very important for their future life or what can do harm to family andfriends. In such cases people should only do things in which they are sure. For example, if someone does not know if he or she has left electriccooker switched on, it is necessary to go back home to check it.In other cases it is not so dangerous to take a risk, so people can try to do their best to derive benefit. Games are a good example for such asituation: one can risk and loose everything, but not in reality. However, some people play НА money so it becomes a situation of the firsttype.In general, all people are different. Some prefer to have much risk and their lives while others try to avoid it in any case, so the decisionoften depends on a personality.In conclusion, I would like to say that personally I think that risk makes life more interesting but more dangerous.
