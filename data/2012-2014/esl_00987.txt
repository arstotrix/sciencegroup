It is believed that the success of a company depends on the happiness of its employees, but some people believe that emotional mood of employees is not connected to the success of a company. So, there are pro and con opinions on this matter.
To begin with, if an employee is happy, he is doing his job better than when he is not, so, the amount of work done certainly depends on the employee’s mood. In addition, a happy employee will always be eager to propose some new ideas touching the working process or business plans of the company he is working for -  that is one more reason why a happy employee is the matter of the prosperous grow of the company. And finally, other companies prone to collaborating with staff that is happy doing their job  because working with happy people is pleasure and because such collaborations usually bring profit.
But the problem has its weak side. Success is not the necessary key of happy employees – it means that success is not the the main aim of happy staff.

To conclude, I believe that advantages outweigh disadvantages.
