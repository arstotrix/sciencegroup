      Mistakes made in written speech form an important field for linguistic research. Yet, they are not marked in most computer corpora and, therefore, it is not possible to search for mistakes in the texts. This problem has become important recently. The present paper outlines a system, which would automatically mark mistakes made in constructions with a verb, a preposition and a noun in the Russian language. The system is described as being based on a trigram search with a number of modifications. It checks the combination of the verb's semantics, the type of preposition used and the case of the noun against a list of correct combinations. Several sources of correct combinations are proposed. The paper ends with a description of two similar studies. The implementation of the system is aimed at giving linguists the opportunity to base their research on this type of mistakes in Russian on a large computer corpus.
