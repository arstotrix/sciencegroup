Therefore, the descriptions presented in this study are maximally profound and modern. In addition, there was carried out research which examined, which method of writing the government of Russian words is the most comfortable and understandable for people who learn Russian as a foreign language. Owing to this, the governments of all analyzed synonyms are written in a user-friendly format.

Besides, several students who know Russian at a proper level were asked to read the written descriptions of synonymic rows and mark fragments which are difficult in understanding.
