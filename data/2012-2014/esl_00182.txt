Sport nowadays is the essential part of life in lots of its aspects. It entertains people, encourages them to  overcome  themselves  and  developphysically and mentally. Besides, sport plays an important role in economics too.  It's  not  a  secret  that  professional  sportsmen  get  highsalaries and people have different opinions on that fact.Lots of sports fans claim that large amount of money circulating in sports destroy the spirit of sporting  competition.  Lots  of  arguments  aregiven to prove this point of view. Many people believe that sportsmen's work is overrated and people, whose  work  is  much  more  dangerous  anduseful (firemen, for example), get many times less than sportsmen. Besides, world famous sportsmen get additional profit from  advertising  well-known brands, on which they sometimes earn even more than on sports. Finally, one shouldn't forget such a thing as sports fixing  when  money  ispaid to pre-determine the result of a match or a competition.Other people, however, don't see anything bad in money invested in sport industry. On the contrary, they consider that the outlook  for  becomingrich in future encourages young sportspeople to develop and aspire to become professionals. More than that, sports demand much time  and  titanicefforts which are not always reasonable as the hopes of sportspeople are rarely realized. The other point is that sports  career  in  most  casesfinishes very early and athletes often leave sports with broken health and no opportunity to earn much money; that is the reason why they  shouldhave worthy earnings not to end up in poverty.As for me, I think that sportsmen (especially famous ones) are often overpaid. The  reasonable  decision  of  that  problem,  as  I  see  it,  isshortening the gap between the rich and the poorer sportsmen by salary reduction for the former ones and its increase for the latter ones.
