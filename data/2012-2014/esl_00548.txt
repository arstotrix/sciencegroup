The diagrams on the picture present the most frequent opinions about the Fairmont Island's pluses and minuses among the tourists. 
Firstly, it is important to point out that the main drawback of Fairmont Island is the expensiveness of the accommodation. Interestingly enough, the issue of accommodation also appears on the second pie chart, which represents the advantages of this place. Thus, although there is very high cost of living on the Fairmont Island, it is probably quite reasonable because of the quality of the accommodation 
Secondly, the survey shows that visitors almost equally enjoy the hospitality (or some other qualities) of the people and picturesque views of this place.
Finally, although there is a quite well-developed culture on Fairmont Island, the development of entertainment is not that impressive.
To conclude, it is not very easy to say whether positive aspects of visiting Fairmont Island overweigh negative ones. The most appropriate judgment, I suppose, is that it largely depends on the requirements of each separate tourist.
