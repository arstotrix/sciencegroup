During several last years a large amount of money was invested in waste disposal in the UK to lessen the harm to the nature  made  by  industrialwaste. It is well known that the production of waste by industries increases from year to year. For example, the  amount  of  waste  produced  byBritish industries increased from 800000 tons in 2008 to 1000000 tons in 2011. That is the reason why more and more money are invested  in  wastedisposal in the UK every year. From 2008 to 2011 6,5 million Euros were invested in total. However, the number of received  complaints  to  localcouncils regarding environmental damage didn't decrease. On the average, each year local councils received 10 thousand complaints  more  than  inthe previous year. Thus, from 2008 to 2011 the number of complaints increased from 35 thousand to 60 thousand - almost  twice.  That  means  thatthe investments made by the British government is not enough and some additional efforts should be applied to make a positive  influence  on  theenvironment of the UK.
