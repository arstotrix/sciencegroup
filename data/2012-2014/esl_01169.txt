In the picture we can see the flowchart, that shows us the process of consumer goods manufacturing. A process itself is illustrated by black arrows and the flow of information feedback is illustrated by blue ones.
Firstly, I would like to notice a stage of production planning. It is one of the most important stages in the whole process. It requires two previous stages (storage and design) to be completed. Storage, in its part, requires raw materials and manufactured components. On the other hand, design comes from product research. And, of course, the information, received in the process of product planning, should be sent back to storage.
Then, the process of manufacturing passes through assembly, inspection, testing, packaging, despatch and finally comes to sales. On this stage, information should be sent back to stages “product planning” and “market research”. Market research is also rather important, as it sends information to advertising, packages and design. Design also receives information from testing.
As we can see, manufactured process is very complicated, and many various specialists are needed for producing consumer goods successfully.
