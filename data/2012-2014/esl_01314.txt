  In given table we can find information about children who were born to women aged 40â€“44 years in Australia in the following years: 1981, 1986, 1996, 2001.
 First of all, I have noticed that in 1996 and 2006 the ratio of women aged 40-44 who have born two children was almost the same with the difference in one-tenth of one percent (38,2% and 38,3%),while the ratio of women who gave birth for three and four children has for 2-3% decreased. . However, the percentage slowly felt down21,5%  and 27,4 %.
From 1981 to 2006 the percentage of women aged 40-44 years who gave birth to two children is the highest, it  reached a peak (38,3 %) in 2006. This means that the tendency of having two children remained for 25 years.
As can be seen  in the chart, the percent of the women who have four or more children from 1981 to 2006 markedly went  down, (1981-27,6%; 1986-18,9%,1996-13,1%;2006-11%). During this period percentage halved.

I noticed that in this four periods childless women became more common, if previously only 8.5% had no children, by 2006 this number had doubled 15,9%.
 Looking on this table I noticed that between 1986 and 1996 the number of women who have no children or only one child has increased, the number of those who have two children mainly did not change, but the number of mothers of three or more children decreased from 27% and 18,9% in 1986 to 24,6% and 13,1% in 1996.
 To sum up,we can notice that women aged between 40-44 year,who have had three or more children has slump a dramatic fall since the 1980s, while the proportions who have had no children, or only one or two children has gone up.That means that in our days is more common to have no children or two children than three or more.
