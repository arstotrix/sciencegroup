Dear Nguyen Chin Huong,
happy to hear from you! I were also very happy to know that you are going to study in Russia. I will give you some advices to be protected from the culture shock. Firstly, Russian people usually don't make any contacts with people thy don't know. So they don't say "Hello" to other people in the lift or near their flat. Also, you should know that Russian-speaking people usually talk much more loader than English or French-speaking. So don't think that they are angry and try to shout at you. Also remember that Russia has a lot of its own literature, music and pictures. So Russians like great European writers, composers and artist, but they mostly talk about their owns. Russians like football and many of them watch European competitions, but they also like hockey. This is the most interesting things about Russians. I hope you will not have a culture shock. I have to go now. Best wishes.
