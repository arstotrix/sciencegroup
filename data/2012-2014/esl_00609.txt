The graph and the chart provide the description of the environmental issues on the Earth within one century from 2000 to 2100th. 
The graph presents the analysis of the extinction of the species on our planet. From 2000 to 2040th the extinction will increase steadily with approximately similar speed. In the decade from 2000 to 2020 and the decade 2020 and 2040 the extinction will make up 40000 per million species. However, starting from the year 2040 within the next 20 years there will be an enormous increase in the extinction and it will achieve its peak. In these 20 years about 30000 extinctions per milllion will happen and in the year 2060 it will consume 50000 extionctions per million. It is three times more than in the previous decades. Since the year 2060 the extinctions will be slowly decreasing and by the end of the century it will have arrived to about 30000 extinctions per million.
The chart shows the threats to the plant life on the planet. Almost Â¾ of the whole damage is the human impact. In the chart it is made up by 81,3%. The rest 18,7% are made up by natural events. 
The significant part of the human damage is the agricultural part. 
Comparing the graph and the chart we may presume that in the middle of the 21st century the harm done to the planet  will achieve its culmination and this will lead to the extinctions. Perhaps, after this catastrophe people will try to reform the means of developing.
