Sorry, I haven`t written the book, I was so busy. But I have some good news! I desided to choose the title "Madwoman in Attic". What do you think about it? Now the ghost lives not on the top floor but on the attic. Our hero hears footsteps above him. He goes to the attic and sees a young girl there. I don`t really know what happens next. I will tell it you in my next blog. 
Well, I`ve finally finished Chapter 5. Hero`s name is Peter Youngblood. Peter is an architect so he understands haw houses are built. I think we need someone who knows about the ghost. Maybe it could be the person who sold the house? Or it is too easy? What do you think? The publishers are happy with Chapter 1 and 2. Deadline now is in Fubruary. Oh, I hope I will a lot happier.
