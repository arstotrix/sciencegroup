Nowadays, online shopping has became one of the most popular forms of shopping, especially among the younger generation, who has no problems how to deal with the Internet. But has this kind of shopping improved life for the consumer?
On the one hand, online shopping makes our life easy. Firstly, we should not waste a lot of time in queue, we have an opportunity just to click the bottom. If you are busy or lazy person you do not need to go to the shopping centers, because online-shopping accepted everywhere. In addition, as we can see, online shopping rather cheaper than traditional one. 
On the other hand, some people claim, that we do not “feel the money”. So, I think people start to spend a lot of money for not very important stuff. Another drawback of online-shopping is that often we cannot choose the right size, or in the Internet things look batter than in reality. 
I see what they mean, but I can not go along with it. It also seems to me that in the Internet we have a wide range of goods than in shops.
In conclusion, although online-shopping is a cheap and convenient way of shopping, goods in the Internet are not as excellent as we want. On balance, I believe that online-shopping help us to solve some problems.
