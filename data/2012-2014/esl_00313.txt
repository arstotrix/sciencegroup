One of the results of the rapid language development is constant replenishment of the vocabulary. New words appear continuously and influence the human speech and writing. These influences refer not to oral and written language only, but also the language of the Internet. Such changes are important to track as with their help predicting the future development of language - in general as well as its specific branches like slangs - is significantly easier. In such areas of the World Wide Web as blogs and Internet communities language is especially inclined to change, and these changes provide useful material for linguistic research in specific areas of language.

Nowadays blogs and Internet communities dedicated to almost all spheres of life exist, and one of them which would provide material for this research is extreme sports. Neologisms related to extreme sports can be tracked in the Internet language used in specific sites such as subject blogs and extreme sports-oriented Internet communities. However, the vocabulary of this sphere is not deeply researched. The object of this paper is to compile the dictionary which would track rapid lexicon development in the new types of extreme sports in Russian. Another object is to make an attempt to predict the future development of this area and appearing new words.
