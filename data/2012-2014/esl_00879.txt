Nowadays the Internet has become one of the most convenient and widely used means of communication. However, some people claim that the Internet cannot always provide you with reliable and useful information that you need. So let us start by considering the facts.
On the one hand, it is undeniable that the Internet has made our live easier in terms of communication. Firstly, compared with a postal service, the Internet is rather fast and comfortable. A few decades ago no one could imagine that people all over the world will be able to communicate with each other in a split second. Secondly, there is a wide range of offered services in the Internet that are free, so the Internet may be also considered as a cheap way of information transfer.
On the other hand, one should admit that the Internet is a powerful source of information. Some part of this information may be very reliable and trustworthy, especially when it is provided by government websites or some web-encyclopedias. However, most of knowledge that we may gain from the Internet should be verified several times. For instance, all Wikipedia articles can be edited by its readers, so it should not be considered as an indisputable truth.
In conclusion I can say that the Internet has a lot of benefits as a means of communication, but it has many restrictions as a source of information too. So it is up to each person to decide whether to accept the information and rely on its provider or not.
