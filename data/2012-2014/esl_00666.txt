Nowadays, one positive tendency can be noticed: the average expectancy of life seems to be increasing. However, this phenomenon might have its negative side-effects as well.
Firs of all, one of the problems that may be caused by the increase of life expectancy is the potential rise of the number of non-working elder people, and, what is vital, some of them might be in fact willing to work, but struggling to find a job because, according to the law, they have already reached the retirement age. This is likely to have a negative impact on the economical situation of the country where an issue like this exists. Nevertheless, a solution for this problem can be found: the retirement age must be made higher. 
Another disputable issue, concerning this topic, is the question of medical support. Seniors are more likely to have serious health problems than younger people, which means that the government would have to invest a lot in the support; it could be if not damaging, than at least noticeable for a state budget. However, this problem might be solved with the ruse of the taxes: this would be people themselves to invest in their own health.
Of course, the issue is disputable and worth serious discussion. Something must be done for the negative impact not to outweigh the positive one.
