The recent debates have proved to be very informative for me. Knowing about the Olympics only what was being showed on TV, I was disappointed by some facts that showed how the games were arranged in reality. Feed back from participants of the Olympics and it's preparations proved that in fact Sochi were not ready for the Olympic games. As for the negative consequences, I was impressed with the situation with the world stock market indexes.

As for holding inter-group debate, this experience seemed to me very useful because of the possibility to work in a group with unfamiliar people and to fond out their opinion on this issue.
