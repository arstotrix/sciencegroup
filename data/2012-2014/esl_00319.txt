One of the problems which a foreign language learner faces is the use of synonyms. Sometimes it is hard to find in what context each of them is preferred - special dictionaries of synonyms can be helpful in solving this problem. Today there are few dictionaries of Russian synonyms, and they can not give the user a clear idea of how to distinguish between them. The dictionaries by N. Abramov and Z. Aleksandrova give only sets of synonyms, sometimes with the examples of the use. The dictionary by A. Evgenjeva and the one called NOSS (НОСС) present the difference between synonyms, but they have few entries with detailed descriptions, while a more useful and convenient dictionary should have many entries with brief and understandable definitions. 'Russian synonyms database' is a project that aims to create a useful source of Russian synonyms, which would help Russian language learners to be able to choose appropriate synonyms.

Our group had to contribute into the project with a small amount of synonymic rows - ten entries for each participant. For each synonym we needed to write information on common meaning, semantic differences, common collocations, differences in collocations, government patterns, examples in a clear short format aimed at unprepared users. The goal was to show the difference between synonyms in such a clear way, that it would be easy to chose the best one in each linguistic situation. An important task was to describe the synonym with simple and non-professional words to make the database as useful as possible for everyone. My personal experience has taught me how to deal with words with prefixes -ne (-не) and -bez/s (-без/с), like bezvrednyi/nevredhyi, bestalannost'/netalantlivost': those that have -bez/s mean complete absence of the feature, those that have -ne do mot have this shade of meaning. This system can be used by other participants of such a project.
