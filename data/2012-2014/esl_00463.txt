                               Great communicators are born, not made
Gооd communication skills are perhaps the most invaluable skills one can have. Regardless of how much you know or how good you are at a specific task, without the ability to express yourself clearly and efficiently, you'll never progress as far in your personal, professional or spiritual being as you could have if you had this ability.
Nevertheless, I consider the most successful orators are tought by someone. Humans have a great potential, but no one can realize it. Why? There are no ways, that we can learn to reach this aim. Each ability can be developed. Your desire is the best guard going up to yours wishes.
