Nowadays many sport events become incredibly popular and TV channels try to show as many football matches, athletic events or Olympic competitions as possible. It involved a lot of money in sports and caused big changes in this industry. Some people believe that the spirit of sporting competitions has been destroyed by the amount of money, while others don't pay much attention to this changes. 
Sometimes famous athletes avoid competitions, where they can't earn much and I suppose this is the main reason, why so many people worry about money in sports. In order to earn much money, sportsmen pay more attention to sponsors; avoid fair play. Nevertheless, athletes still do their job and I think we shouldn't count their salary. By the way, sport corruption rises every day and it is also very important problem. I think that governments must deal with this serious problem. 
However, it is very important to popularize sport in the whole world and the more TV channels show different sport competitions, the more children watch these events. I suppose, that with the help of money, we can promote sport in Africa, in different poor countries, where it is necessary. It is great and I hope that amount of money can change the quality of live translations, organization of big competitions.
In conclusion, athletes are people whose aim of life is sport and I hope that nobody and nothing can kill the spirit of competitions. And in the future we will see only positive side of money.
