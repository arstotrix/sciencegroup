Sorry, guys, haven’t written for a long time ‘cause have been extremely busy. Good news everyone! I’ve decided to title my book “Madwoman in Attic”. What do you think? I want now to place the ghost not on the top floor but in the attic. Main hero hears strange footsteps above him, goes to attic and suddenly sees young girl there. I don’t know yet what will happen next, but I wish I could tell you in next blog. 
Also I finally have finished Chapter 5! Main hero’s name is Pete Youngblood. I find it extremely good, don’t you think so? He’s an architect, so he understands pretty everything about how houses are built. And now he needs someone who knows something about that ghost. Maybe it’ll be a person who sold the house to Pete… Isn’t it too easy? What do you think, folks?
And, last but not least, my new publishers are incredibly happy with Chapters 1 and 2!  They gave me a new deadline now, it’s February. I am now a lot happier then I was two weeks ago when old publishers returned me my manuscript. Hope everyone has a great day. See ya later!
