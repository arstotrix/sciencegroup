The graphs present the wieght statistics of newtowners in 1950 and in 2010. While in 1950 the percent of people with ideal weight does not differ a lot between age groups (it fluctuates from 50% to 70%), the same range in 2010 is much noticeable: from the least 5% in the eldest group to just over 70 in the youngest. However, in 2010 comparing to 1950 the amount of obessed people rose dramatically. In 1950 there were not obessed 20-29-year-old people, nor 30-39, but in 2010 5-10% can be seen. From a third to a half of 40-59-year-old groups Newtown inhabitants in 2010 is opposed to just 10-20% people of the same agein 1950. The greatest contrast demonstrates the eldest group under investigation - 60-69. In 1950 it shows less than 10 percent and in 2010 - sevent times more that amount (60%). The relevant change can be seen also in the overweight group: in 2010 it fluctuates between 5-35%, 30-49-year-old people demonstrating highest numbers, and 5-20% in 1950 with the peak in 40-49. In 20th century amount of people with weight less than ideal is much higher than that of 21th. It starts with 30% amoung 20-29, for the next decade it increases by 10%, than it drops to about a 7th. Amoung 50-59-year-old it is slightly more than a 5th and more than 40% of people aged 60-69 are underweighted. In 2010 only group of 20-29 had reached a 5th, all other had no more than 10%. The main trend, contrasting these charts, is the greater number of overweight ant obsese people in 2010.
