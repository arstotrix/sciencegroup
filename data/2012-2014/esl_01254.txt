Nowadays there are a lot of low-cost airlines, which allow people to travel all over the world relatively cheaply. A large number of flights can provide people with an opportunity to move from one continent to another almost every time they want to. But is it always good? 

The greatest benefit is that low-cost airlines sell cheap tickets, which make them affordable for many people. For some of them it is the only chance to visit the most interesting and beautiful places of the world or meet with their friends and relatives. Another point in favour of low-cost companies is that they provide their passengers with choice whether to eat on board or not. In many cases the flight is really short so not everybody needs this service. In addition, some companies offer their passengers to pay for their luggage. This can help people travelling without luggage to save their money.  

However, some people think differently. They claim that low-cost airlines are not fair to their passengers. The time of their departures and arrivals is often uncomfortable, for instance, in the midnight. Their host airports are usually far from the city centre. What is more, passengers must check in for their flight online otherwise they will have to pay extra money (often even more than they have paid for the ticket). Another drawback to cheap flights is that people often use them even if they do not really need to. In many cases it is possible to go somewhere by train, which is much greener means of transport. In modern world people should think about the damage of air pollution caused by planes. 

To sum up, the impact of introducing low-cost airlines was huge and it managed to make a revolution in the field of travelling. All in all, I strongly believe that the advantages of low-cost airlines outweigh the disadvantages.
