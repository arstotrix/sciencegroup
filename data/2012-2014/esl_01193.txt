Why are the blogs so popular? Or as the bloggers themselves usually say ‘Y R the blogs so popular? :)’ Personally, I love blogs. The way of writing seems to me very friendly, it is always not a monologue, but a dialogue. Blogs are open for any sort of feedback, positive or negative whereas it’s very difficult to discuss a book with its author. Also a style of writing itself is familiar and close to spoken language.  That is what breaks the wall between the writer and the reader, they all are equal on the internet. And the diversity of internet languages can’t be overlooked too, there are so many interesting “dialects” like leetspeak or olbanian. I think that will be very exciting to make some research on that theme. But, of course, it isn’t the main and the only one reason of blogging-fever. You can find a blog that meets all your needs. It’s extremely easy now to find a recipe for birthday cake, to decide which laptop is better or to find out where to go this weekend. And they are faster even then newspapers and TV. The blogs give a possibility to everyone to report and to react immediately on any accident. Nowadays everyone lives in eternal hurry and we all need a new form of communication as fast as this world and our mind are. So, that’s why the blogs are so necessary and popular.
