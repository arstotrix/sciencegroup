Men are more interested in sport than women. Discuss.
 There is an opinion that men are more keen on sport than women. First of all, we should decide, what does it mean «to be interested in sport». Some people prefer to watch sport competitions on TV meantime other people prefer doing sport by themselves or even take part in such competitions. I think, both of that activities can be called «be interested in sport».
So, some people say that men are more enthusiastic about sport. First argument is that man are very enthusiastic sports’ fans.There is a common image of men who gather together to watch some broadcast of the match, discuss likelihood results of the game and so on. Hardly can we imagine the same situation with women. Besides that, being strong is a good quality for men, and sport is a good way to become stronger.
In spite of this I disagree that today men are more interested in sport than women. Nowadays an idea of healthy lifestyle and fitness is very popular among men and women equally. More and more women are joining gyms because they want to look healthier and slimmer. Many women choose sport as their hobby.
To sum up with, in despite of fact that women aren’t such enthusiastic sports’ fans as men are, my opinion is that we can’t claim that men are more keen on sport than women and i lean that men and women are equally interested in sport.
