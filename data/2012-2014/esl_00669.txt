In modern world the increasing of average life expectancy is mostly considered to be a significant factor proving the high standards of living. Although a number of problems has arisen as a result of this, there are solutions.
	One of the first problems caused by the growing level of the average life expectancy is the issue is the increasing need of consumer products, food and fresh water. For example, the scientists have proved that the increase of the consumption of a variety of natural sources, such as wood, mineral oil and water must be immediately reduced  otherwise it will cause a serious lack of them in future. Another major problem is the growing of the social budget spent on the support of the aged people in many modern countries, because the longer people live during the pensionable age, the longer they claim the government financial support. These days, many developed countries have to establish the high level of taxes in order to cover the expenses of social sphere supply.
	It is important that action is taken to minimize the side effects of the process of the increasing life expectancy. Governments should ensure that the programs of saving and renewing of the natural resources are developed and started up.  Commercial organizations have also a part to play as a significant amount of waste products may be recycled and used more than once. The legislative authorities must also consider some ways to solve the tax problem as, for example, the extension of the working age according to the average life span in those countries where this problem has arisen.
	To conclude, the high level of the life expectancy in the modern world is a significant achievement of the developed countries but not without several side effects. However, with the right action by governments, its agencies and commercial organizations, the existing negative effects can be reduced to minimum.
