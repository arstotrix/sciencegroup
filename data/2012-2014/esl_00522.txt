The chart represents the preferences of people living in Australia concerning the places they visit in leisure time.
Going to cinema seems to be the most popular choice of Australians. However, there is an amendment concerning people not coming from English-speaking countries: for them going to libraries is slightly more attractive. In the opposite, theatres are chosen by the smallest amount of people.
In some cases the places of spending leisure time evidently correlate with the countries people come from. For example, there is a tendency of migrants from English-speaking countries to be the most frequent visitors of theatres and zoos. The aboriginals are remarkable for hitting the highest percent in the chart: 70% of them are cinema-goers. People not born in English-speaking countries would seem the most inactive persons comparing to the others if more than a half of them didn't go to libraries.
The reasons of the noted distribution can be very different. Libraries may be an attractive place for not English-speakers because of an opportunity to touch with their native culture and language (by reading books in it). Theatres are certainly more expensive than the other places and therefore less popular. Zoos are mostly for children. Speaking about cinemas, their popularity can easily be understood: they are interesting and suitable for everyone. To sum up, the statistics is highly demonstrative!
