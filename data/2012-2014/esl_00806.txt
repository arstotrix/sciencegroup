Nowadays it is common to think that people depend on technology so much that they literally would not survive without it. I could not entirely agree with that, but it is true that in many situations when the technical devices fail for some reason (break down, the battery dies, etc), people get a bit lost and do not know what to do.  As I see it, for example, when the lights go off, because of some accident, I can survive with candles and without the computer. Or if the washing machine breaks down I could wash stuff with my hands, I would not want to do it forever, but would be able to do so. For some people it might be a bigger problem, but I am sure everyone can handle it somehow. On the other hand, I know that a lot of children are much better at typing than they are at writing with their hands, they also write much more grammatically correct on the computers, because of the autocorrect. That might seem like a big problem at first, but that actually means they they do not have to write that often and that very soon they might not need to do it at all.

Nevertheless, I want to say that although we might be relying too much on technology, it is very reliable and the fact that we, for example, do not have to look at the map when we are driving somewhere far and can just listen to the GPS does not raise concern about some people not being able to go anywhere without it, but arouses admiration that they almost never have to. Much more frightening thing is that people do not understand how the technology that they are using works as they used to 50 years ago.
