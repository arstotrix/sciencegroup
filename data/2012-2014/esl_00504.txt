Globalisation has a lot of advantages. It helps people to get high-quality goods for a low price, gives everybody lots of opportunities to make their life better, and lets most countries improve their living standards. Globalisation offers people different ways of making their life more interesting and diverse, and also it helps poor countries to develop their economy system. However, this global process has some disadvantages. First of all, a lot of poor countries depend on rich ones. That's why they can't increase their level of development without the assistance of the last. Secondly, globalization makes people equal, but it destroys local cultures and traditions of small nations. In the end, it very often leads to the neglect of nature and environment, which is one of the awful things. I think there is no certain way of deciding whether globalization is good or not because there are two sides of the medal.
