No sooner had I closed my eyes than I fell asleep.
No sooner had she read the letter than she started crying.

Hardly had I reached the bus stop when the bus came.
Hardly had I arrived home when my cat ran to me. 

Barely had they won the match when the coach had a heart attack.
She barely acknowledged his presence.

They have sold scarcely any copies of the book.
I scarcely had time to call you before my mom called me.
