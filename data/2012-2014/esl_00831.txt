Nowadays the Internet has become an integral part of our life and most people can't imagine their very existence without surfing the Web for information and entertainment. However, as time goes by, the discussion about whether the Internet is really so good for communication and finding information or not becomes only hotter.

In my point of view, benefits of using the Internet prevails all the possible drawbacks. When it comes to looking for different kinds of information, the instantaneity is the major advantage for ordinary users. There is no more need to go to the libraries and spend many time, finding pieces of information among the vast volumes of books, all the problems may be solved in a moment by one and only click. What is also very useful is that people can find all the information they need, staying in cosy atmosphere of their own houses. However, there are many things, like spam or advertisements, which can distract users, but it is only a matter of experience - after some unfortunate attempts people become more advanced and concentrated and they can find anything they want very quickly.

It becomes harder to judge when it comes to communication. Never in my life I've been happier with  technical progress than nowadays, when I am far away from home and have only one option to see my family and friends - by Skype. However, what many people don't think about is the fact that communication on-line almost replaced meetings face-to-face. It is very sad, but, actually, everything is in our arms: the Interner gives us many options to communicate and we are the ones who have to decide how to make the best of it.

All in all, the Internet plays such a crucial role in our life that there always will be discussions about how and to which extent people should use it. I tend to think that we can cope with all the drawbacks and takes only advantages from using the Internet for any aim.
