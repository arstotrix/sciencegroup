Nowadays the construction of housing is a very serious business. There are a significant number of people and a considerable amount of money that are in this business. So the question is that if it is worth spending money on cheap housing or on well-designed buildings.
On the one hand, population increases and more housing is needed. In my opinion, when it is necessary to have a lot of something it is better to have it at a cheap price; it is more effective way to get what is wanted. So cheap housing and facilities do not mean that they are unacceptable and that houses are unfit for habitation, it means that citizens can pay less for their dwelling. Eventually, people can afford to buy their own house. I think that nobody will deny that almost every city now is suffered from the lack of housing.
On the other hand, all these new blocks of standard houses make people feel dejection. Architectures who are engaged in such projects do not frequently find time and money for the designing. Thereby these houses are far from being beautiful. From my point of view, such kind of buildings does not blend with the surrounding land of the city. But if something beautiful appears the construction will cost much more and the rent will be much higher than for standard houses.
Summing up I would like to say that the balance of the construction of cheap housing and well-designed buildings should be kept. To my mind, it is unreasonable to build expensive houses, while most people cannot live there. So the government should be sensible and provide their citizens with more affordable housing.
