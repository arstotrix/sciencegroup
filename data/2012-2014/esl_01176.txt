At the table below we can see some statistical data about Australian demography. It presents the number of children ever born to 40-44-year-old women in 1981, 1986, 1996 and 2006 year. 
The most remarkable thing is that the number of childless women, which was 8,5 % in 1981, has raised by 7,2 % of the whole amount of women of this age during this time. Firstly, it has increased by 1.2 % by 1986 and than it gained 3,1 % every 10 years.
Exactly the same way, the 1-child and the 2-children groups have become noticeably larger (especially the last one). The number of mothers with one child has increased from 7,6% to 8,7 % during the first five years. During the next ten years it has gained 2,6 %, and in 2006 it finally reached the amount of 13,2 %.
The next group has numbered 29 % of the whole amount of women in 1981, then it has I increased by 6,6 % by 1986, it has gained 2,6 % during next 10 years, and it has raised only 0,1 percent by 2006.
On the contrary, the number of women with 3 and especially with 4 children has seriously decreased. The last group has lost 16,6 %, which is more than a half of its initial size - 27,6 %. During the first five years it has become lower by 8,7 % and by 1996 it has reached the amount of 13,1%. As for the 3-children group, it has lost only 0,4 % by 1986, 2,4 % during next 10 years and finally has become only 21,5 % of the whole amount of women.
