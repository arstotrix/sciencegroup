Transport (or transportation) is the movement of people, cattle, animals and goods from one location to another. Nowadays there are a lot of types of transport: people travel by busses, cars, bicycles, boats and even spaceships. We can chose the method we prefer or consider more convenient. Of course, in such circumstances it seems that the world has become smaller: it takes a few hours to travel to a differenf city, country or even a continent. This fact inspires people and makes them think of quicker, more convenient and more powerful mashines. That is why we are free now to chose any kind of car, motorcycle or bicycle we can imagine.	Nevertheless, all these advantages of quick and powerful transport pale before one big problem it causes. Using any kind of transport that we have now seriously damages ecology. Transport is a major use of energy and burns most of the world's petroleum. This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector. Road transport is the largest contributor to global warming.	Some big concerns, though, are trying to produce a special kind of transport that would use electricity. Electrocars (e.g. 'Ё-мобиль' in Russia) seem to be original and uncommon, but not viable. This happens for several reasons. First, not many people prefer chosing new kind of transport after getting used to a more convenient one. Second, there aren't that many possibilities to drive an electrocar in a city where roads are supposed to be 'used' by ordinary cars. Third, even if a small amount of people agrees to use electrocars, it won't change the situation in the whole world.	Even though progress has led us to comfortable life, we shouldn't forget about taking care of nature which also means taking care of ourselves and future generations.
