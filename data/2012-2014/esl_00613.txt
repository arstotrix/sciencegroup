	It is commonly known that the variety of vegetables and animals on Earth is reducing. The first graph shows the forecast of extinction rate by the end of this century. Till 2020 it predicts a rise in disappearing species and the pace of this rise will double every decade. Between 2020 and 2060 the rate will increase by 30 000 per million species. At the end of the 2040-2060 decade the planet will lost 50 000 kinds per million of its plants and animals - that is more than 5 times more than at the beginning of the century. Then, after 2060 the rate will decrease constantly and steady to archieve in 2100 the number of less than 30 000 per million.
	The pie chart given shows the proportion of natural and human influence on the death of plants. The nature is in less than 20% of cases the reason of this process, while the main damager is humanity. Activities that impacts heavily the flora are: harvesting that forms 14,4% of all threats, development reaching the number of just over 10% and logging (9,7%). These threats can be compared with all natural events (except disasters that make 7%). Other reasons' impact fluctuates near 5%.
	Overall, it can be seen that the extinction rate is growing and the main impact has human activity. According to this, some conclusions and decisions can be made.
