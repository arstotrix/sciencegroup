The graph and the chart in the task reflect statistical information concerning forecast for extinction of plant and animal species in tropical forests and threats to plant life, correspondingly. 
According to the graph, the extinctions  will reach their peak by 2060, when about 5% of the whole amount of species will disappear. The main increase in the number of disappeared species is expected from 2040 to 2060 and will reach almost three per cents. But afterwards, by the year 2100, the dying out will have slowed down to the indices of the period from 2020 to 2040, in other words, to approximately 10,000 species, or one per cent, in twenty years. Surprisingly, the lowest figure goes to the first twenty years of the century, when the number of tropical species dying out is presumably only 5 thousands per million species. 
The chart indicates factors affecting plants. The most powerful and destructive are those related to human activities as they have amount in total 81,3% while natural events only the rest 18,7%. Among the items of the threats provided by human beings, agriculture, harvesting, development and logging have the highest indexes adding up to more than 50% of the whole amount of factors taken into account. This last data displays the fact, that the most part of the human impact on plants can not be eliminated or even reduced as it is directly connected with the food supply and development and the humanity is unable to consume less foodstuff or even slow down its development. 
If the prediction made by graph is correct the most probable feature providing the decrease of the extinction of plant species from 2060 to 2080 is the reduction of the invasive plant species (Nowadays they produce five per cents of the amount of danger to plant life). Another prospective improvement which may be effective is decreasing of the damages causing by natural disasters (7 per cents).
