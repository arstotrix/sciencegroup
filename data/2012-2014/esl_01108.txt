Sorry, I have not written you because I was busy. I have good news! I decide to choose tittle for the book “Madwoman in Attic”. What do you think about it? Now the ghost lives on the top floor, but on the attic hero hears footsteps above him. He goes to attic and sees young girl. I do not know what will happen next, but I will tell you about it in next blog.
I have finished Chapter 5. Hero name is Peter Youngblood. He is architect. So he understands how houses built.  I need someone who knows about the ghost. Maybe the person who sold the house?  Or it’s too easy? What do you think about it? Publishers were happy because I have written chapters 1 and 2. The publishing house has changed the deadline again, deadline now on February.  I am lot happier.
