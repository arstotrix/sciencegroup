Some people think graffiti is a form of vandalism and should be extirpated. Others believe it is art and has a right to stay and develop.
As for me, graffiti, which difference from any other style of drawing is the surface to cover with paint, can be counted as art as long as it is drawn legally and with permission.  Although some people might think that breaking the law is a necessary part of creating this kind of art. Well, I do not have to agree with them. I have seen lots of graffiti being painted in parks by peaceful artists. And what they draw can definitely be counted as pieces of art, even masterpieces.  There are highly gifted young people who can draw 3D objects on the ground and on the walls. It can be a lake with swans in the middle of the street, for example, and from the certain angle it looks like real lake with living birds and as you come closer they seem to move. Such art requires high professionalism and hard work. Every era has its own style of painting and graffiti is what we have for nearest future.
Lots of geniuses were not appreciated at first, lots of achievements were not understood. We should be less conservative and try to let new art develop, however, we should not forget about criticism.
