Since there is no dictionary of Russian synonyms that would have a big word coverage and be informative enough at the same time, 'Russian synonyms database' project aims to create such a convenient computer dictionary presenting synonyms and providing the relevant information, which would help the user to choose the appropriate word from a group. The database provides the information on the general meaning of synonyms, their common and specific use in context, government patterns and collocations. This information is organized in a special format of electronic table. The current course paper presents four tables of rows with all the pieces of information and four more tables with the information on collocations only - these rows are the basis of the prospective work. The paper also provides the comments on each row: the details which could not be included in the tables, the comments and other notes. These notes extend the information in the tables: there are the explanations of why some words are removed or added into the original rows, the conclusions about the tendencies of the use of the synonyms, the suggestions about how the synonymic rows are going to change in the future. These notes and synonymic rows themselves may be used by other people working on the project. And the whole project is going to provide Russian language learners with a useful and convenient electronic dictionary of Russian synonyms.
