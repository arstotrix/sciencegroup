Nowadays in different countries the ages of children going to school vary between four and seven or eight years old. Some people believe that than earlier you start getting education the better result would be.
I think it is not necessary to begin formal education at four years. Firstly, at this age children only start reading, some of them speaking, it is more suitable for them to go to the kindergarten, where they would have a lot of time talking, playing with each other and get some basic educational skills. Secondly, at the elder age children would be keen on learning something new, they want to develop their knowledge about outward things. I can give an example drawing on my experience. My parents sent me to a school when I was only 5 years old boy, it were pre-school classes two times per week. I remember, that I did not really like these days, I felt so uncomfortable there. That’s why I think it is a good idea to begin formal school until children are seven or eight.
On the other hand, going to school as early as possible can be a good way to educate people. The position of some parents is the earlier start – the better result you will achieve. Parents want from their children to be a genius, to learn hard and so on. Some parents can afford to spent all day long with their child and they decided to send him at school as soon as possible. 
At the conclusion I want to say that every parent has to choose the future of their children at the young age, but they should ask children prepare them to begin education or not. And result would be better.
