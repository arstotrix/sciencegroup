By the end of 2060 it is expected that the extinction will reach its peak  with the figures of 50 000 per decade.  
A more thorough look to a pie chart reveals us the possible factors that worsening situation.   Overall, two main problems represent threats to a plant life, that is the human impact and the natural events.
