The given table provides us with the data on student enrolments at Bristol University in the years of 1928, 1958 and 2008. It gives the information on gender percentage and the rate of students living within 30 miles of Bristol and from overseas.
Overall, it is evident that the number of students has increased dramatically throughout last 80 years and has become approximately 30 times as big. It is also obvious that the percentage of female and male students has only once suffered serious changes in 1958 with the number of males more than twice as big than females while in the years of 1928 and 2008 their percentages were almost equal.
As for the number of students who came from within 30 miles of Bristol, it has suffered a dramatic decrease from 50 per cent in 1928 to only 1-2 per cent 80 years later. However, the percentage of those who came from overseas almost hasnâ€™t changed from 1928 to 1958, but then it started growing rapidly, reaching its peak of 28 per cent, which is approximately 5 times as big, in 2008.
From the data given in the table one can see that the number of students at Bristol University has grown rapidly with gender percentage changes in 1958, returning then back into its previous state. The table also shows that the percentage of students from within 30 miles from Bristol has fallen while the number of students from the overseas has grown dramatically.
