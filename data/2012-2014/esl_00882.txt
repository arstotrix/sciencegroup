Nowadays there is a belief that watching TV programs replaces doing active sports for young people.

On the one hand, the young are too lazy to force themselves to do sports. Moreover, some of them are busy at work and university all day and they don’t have time for sport. If such people have a free minute they’d rather watch tennis on TV instead of playing themselves. Also I’d like to note that many people having a hard to find motivation to be diligent in sport. For example, I've always wanted to learn to skateboard. But nowadays there are a lot of TV programs about this sport and It’s enough for me. I understand that I do not want to waste my time on it because the most important thing for me is science and all free time I would like to work at some project, not to do sport.

On the other hand, there is nothing better than keeping your body in shape. It’s much nicer for each of us to see a slender, smart person and not a decrepit fatty in the mirror. This is the easiest way to strengthen your immune system and give your brain a rest. Also active pastime gives you a much better chance to feel life than watching sports on TV, and I know a lot of young people who share this opinion. Despite all my work at University, I continue to do judo to be healthy.

In conclusion I would like to say that people should play sports. This is really important. Sports make us much healthier and more beautiful. It is useful to do sport not only for the body, but also for the mind and psyche. And I don’t think that television affects how many people are not involved in sports.
