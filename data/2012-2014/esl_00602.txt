The first graph predicts a rapid increase in the extinction rate of animal and plant species in tropical forests. Nowadays variety rate of species is the highest in tropical forests. Massive extinction of species means not only local catastrophe, but also a worldwide tragedy of losing an enourmous life cradle.
The second graph shows the percentage of potential threat from both human and natural factores. While natural events can't even reach 20%, human impact stands for more than 80%.
The biggest part of human impact is agriculture, with 4% lower being harvesting. These are common activities of human beings. The number of humans on Earth is only growing, with only 1/3 of them being able to take full meals every day and having a house to live. This means that resources today are not enough to keep humanity healthy and more need to be developed.
Applying this information to the first graph means the developement of agricultural ground where today we find tropical forests. The number of extinct plants and animals reaches 50 thousands by decade 2060, which is most likely the peak of the "conquest" - it would mean the end of land adaptation by that time.
It is hard to decide what comes of greater importance - lives of people or natural variety, as the morality is ambiguous. My opinion is that harvesting the jungle should be avoided by all means and some other way to help people should be found.
