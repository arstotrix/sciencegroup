“Good communicators are born, not made” – I partially share this opinion. 

On the one hand I think that the eloquence is a kind of talent, like a talent 

for painting or for music. Moreover you have to be a sociable person for 

being a good communicator. And I suppose that the sociability is also one 

of inborn human quality.

 On the other hand you can learn to draw without any extraordinary gift. 

You will never be great, but you can be pretty good. On my opinion that’s 

also right when we talk about oratory. And the historical examples show 

us, that even if it seems that somebody absolutely cannot be public 

speaker, it means nothing. So, Demosthenes was he born communicator 

or not? He is one of the most famous orators in the history, but as a boy he 

had a lot of speaking problems as a mispronouncing r and l, an ugly facial 

expression, involuntary gesticulation and so on.
