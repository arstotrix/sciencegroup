The problems of morphemic segmentation 
This term paper deals with the problems of morphemic segmentation in automatic text processing. Despite the existence of a large number of papers dealing with this problem and some corresponding software, a considerable part of problems impeding the proper automatic morphemic segmentation remains as yet unsolved. For instance, there is no absolutely adequate solution to the problems of homonymy so far. In particular, a full-fledged solution of the problems of homonymy (the best at the moment of the program involves the manual removal of homonymy in ambiguous cases) is not found - fusion character of the Russian language makes it impossible to unambiguously morphemic division of the wordforms. Also the computer considers that the words "бедствие" and "убеждать" are cognate, that plays an important role in erroneous morphemic division, made by the program.
The purpose of the given research work in addition to referencing the accumulated knowledge on this issue is to identify laws that allow to simplify the process of morphemic segmentation for automatic processing. It is proved the impossibility of a purely lexical approach to solving the problem and is tested two hypotheses, potentially having all chances to become a successful way out of the current difficulties.
