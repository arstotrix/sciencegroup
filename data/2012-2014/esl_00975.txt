Sorry, I haven’t written this week, I was terribly busy. Good news! I’ve finally decided on my new story’s title, I will call it “Madwoman in Attic”. So, what do you think about this name? 
Now a ghost not lives on the top floor, it settles down in an attic. My hero hears footsteps above him, goes to the attic and sees there a young girl… I don’t know yet what will happen next, but I promise to tell you next blog.
I’ve finished chapter 5. Hero’s name  is Peter Youngblood, he is an architect, so he understands about building houses. But he needs someone who knows about ghosts. Maybe it would be the person, who sold the house, or it’s too easy? What do you think, my gently reader? Publishers would be happy to print Chapters 1 and 2, deadline is in February. I am a lot happier!
