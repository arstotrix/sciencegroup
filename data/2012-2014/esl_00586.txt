The bar charts below present the difference in weight categories among several age groups. The first bar chart describes the situation that took place in 2010 while the second one shows the data of 1950.
In the middle of the 20th century the percentage of the people who have the ideal weight from 20 to 29 years old were quite close to the situation in 2010. In both charts we can notice that the percentage is close to 60% in 2010 and to 70% in 1950. Also we may see that in both periods these age group exceeds in having the best weight parametrs. 
Over the range of the people in their 30s we can clearly see the appearance of people with a little overweight. However, in the 21st century the amount of those who have got overweight is slightly bigger than in the previous century. While in 2010 there is about 35% of overweight people of the whole respondents, in 1950 there was only 20% of the total amount.
From 30s to 60s the situation in the middle of the 20th century didn't change a lot. For example, the amount of those who have perfect weight for their age was quite stable. The only thing we have to notice is that the number of people who were overweight became a little smaller while appeared more people who were obese. In 2010 the situation is absolutely different. The percentage of those who are obese is several times higher in the range from 30s to 60s.
In 1950s there was a little amount of obese people among those who were in their 60s. Contrary to the situation in 20th century, the percentage of obese respondents in 21st century is enormous and is several times higher.
