That encounter happened to me a week ago when I was taking a tram home from the shopping mall. I was taking to my Mum when saw a familiar face in the crowd but I couldn’t understand where I could have seen this face earlier. I was nearly shocked when this person greeted me and completely horrified when I understood that this person was in the uniform. I hope that this messy train of thoughts wasn’t shown on my face. Only after this person came closer I understood that it was my former classmate whom I haven’t seen for about 3 years and a half. He was wearing uniform because that day he had a military chair at his university. My classmate and I got off the tram leaving my Mum alone as she had to collect my brother from school. We live nearly close to each other and we walked our ways home talking about all the events happened with us when we were studying together. The weather was wonderful and it was such a nice experience to discuss our memories from the past.
