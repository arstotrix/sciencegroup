Last debates topic was "Educational system based on curriculi and standardized testing leads to establishing the system of indoctrination of the young, which only prepares them for life of conformity".
Government team asserts that it's bad system of education to place pupils into frameworks, because they can't develop creativity and don't discover anything new. The main idea of opposition team was that standards do not lead to conformity, they also develop creativity.
It's well-known that earth was born from the chaos and people need order in their lives. All people are different, but from the childhood people have to be placed into frameworks. It makes them more organized, because if you give them a lot of space, they doesn't aim anything, and if you limit them, they put all their skills and organize time effectively to achieve the aim. It's natural to act according to traditions and standards.
A good example how people following standards create something new it's poets.
Both teams spoke about the aim of education. Government team explained that standardized education only direct to get the diploma and marks are main things for students and for professors and it's bad. Our team contends that for most students the goal is not only good marks and diploma but also knowledge. As one world-famous physicist said, "It doesn't matter what we cover, it matters what you discover". 
I think, it's impossible to create the world where everyone will be the same. It's utopian dream. And people who can't stand with this similarity will be always exist (for example, in dystopian novels).
