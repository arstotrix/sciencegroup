The graph shows how much drivers in the US and the UK spend on petrol, measured in percents of their income.
Looking at the given information we can see some evident differences between two countries. For example, we can say that the US citizens overall tend to spend more on petrol than the people of the UK. Maybe, the reason for this is that the cost of petrol is higher in the USA or that bicycles are much more popular in the United Kingdom, so the Britains do not use cars as often as Americans.
The graph also shows the correlations between certain social classes (poorest, middle-income, richest) and the percentage of income they spend on petrol. While in the UK the poorest class spends the least (from 0,5 to 2,5%), in the USA this class is the one that spends the most (up to 5,2%). The reachest people in the USA spend just about 2,5% of their income, but in the UK this number can rise from 3,4 to almost 4% (practically the same amount that middle-class people spend in the country). However, in the USA the middle class spends up to 5% of their income on petrol.
While those correlations in the US seem reasonable, if we imagine that the cars are equally popular among all social classes, the correlations in the UK appear rather surprising. Maybe, the reason for this is that people who can hardly afford a car or an amount of petrol needed in the UK tend to use other kinds of transport: buses, bicycles, underground.
