Development of social networking gives people a lot of opportunities, and a free flow of information is one of them. People have always been prone to share their opinion with others, and internet blogging is just a one of the ways to perform your point of view. So, a blog is the website, where someone posts his notes, thoughts and so on. In my view, blog is not a genre, it’s just a new platform that allows people to reflect, share opinions(like journals, magazines etc.), and a blogger choses a genre by himself. 
The topic of a blog can be very different as well as its style(genre). There are blogs about traveling, with a lot of photos, blogs about everyday life, that can be quite interesting to read, with a lot of beautiful descriptions and exciting facts(but some of those are pretty boring), beauty-blogs, culinary blogs…
On the one hand blog writing has a lot of advantages: it’s free and available to everyone, so anybody who has something he wants to share is able to do it. Besides that, if another internet user is looking for some special information his chance to find such information increases significantly. In other words, thanks to blog writing we have plenty of diversified information.
But on the other hand each of the advantages has its downside. Since anybody can start blogging, as the result we receive too much subjective opinions. Everybody writes what he wants, and it’s already difficult to separate the good blogs from the bad by reason of their excessive number.
What about me, i’m not keen on surfing the net and reading blogs, but I believe that in spite of the above, somebody can benefit from blogs. As I know you can select some blogs you like, subscribe on their authors and read only what you will find interesting.
To conclude, if you have enough free time and desire, you are likely to find blog that you will read with pleasure and interest. Therefore by now I think about blog writing as about something good and useful.
