If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologist

classes I would give different tasks during the lessons that develop imagination skills. For example, I  

would offer to write a short  5-minute composition as if the child was a stone what would he or she feel. 

 After  that if all the students succeeded the task, I would propose them brain storm. This game in my 

point of view would force the brain to work. I think it would be very important because imagination is not 

a "soft skill." It is the workspace of our brain, the place where connections are made between ideas to 

create something new. So if all my students knew how to use all their use gyrus they would be on the on 

the right track to achieve the goal and it would rather be a small success for me.

 If I wanted to interest all the students I would always change the place of meetings and we would visit 

different museums and exhibitions and after that my students would have to describe what they had seen.

I would teach them how to read other way round and in that way I hope all of them would become 

successful.
