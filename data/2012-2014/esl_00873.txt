Nowadays some modern artists make a lot of money on their creations when the other ones are under the poverty line. As far as I am concerned governments should provide every artist with money he or she needs for work.
As I see it, it is very hard to become a successful artist. It seems to me that if an artist is rich and famous it is more about luck than about his or her talent. In most cases talent does not go alongside with money. For example, Paul Gauguin, a well-known impressionist, dead because of poverty and diseases. He was generally recognized after years of his death. Even today when a talent of an artist can be adapted to different spheres of life, we cannot imagine a wealthy artist. Nowadays being an artist means being a poor man. I suppose that government should solve this problem. People of art should be supported by governmental funds, they should be provided with all they need to create. Nowadays only popular and well-known artist can have a good wealthy life but there are a few of them. As a rule real Creators are poor, because for them wealth is not an aim. That is why government should support them and provide them with money.
To sum up, I would like to say that real artists are the movers of mankind. It is hard to exaggerate their contribution to the course of history. That is why government should encourage them with money and provide a well-deserved life for them.
