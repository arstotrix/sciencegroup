	Some people maintain that classes with mixed abilities are more profitable for children than classes separated on the principle of their academic abilities. Others strongly believe in the opposite point of view. In this essay both opinions are analyzed.
	It is generally known, that classes with mixed abilities promote better conditionals for comprehensive development. For instance, every student has his own strength and weakness talants, consequently children can learn from each other, explaining thing they are good at. Furthermore, this kind of system will develop the respect to every persons, since everybody has his own talented and everybody is gifted in different ways.
	However, special education can provide better knowledge of subject children skilled in. Thereby, students will gain an understanding of some studies, but they will know only the basis of another studies. That is more efficient for their future lives and future professions, because in the contemporary reality the broad specialists are almost entirely unclaimed. Besides, the special education gives a chance for students to reach the advanced levels much faster, than their peers in mixed classes, and faster plunge into profound studies. At last, students move in the circles of like-minded person, who have the same interests, from childhood.
	To conclude, I can confidently say that deep knowledge of one study is more important, than the superficial knowledge of several studies. Firstly, advanced knowledge provides you with promising career in the chosen study. Secondly, it guarantees  higher chances to enter the respectable university. Thus, I advise schools to focus this education strategy.
