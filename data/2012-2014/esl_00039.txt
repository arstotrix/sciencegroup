Humor is a component that is often considered useful in advertisement. However, certain reseches disagree .

Moreover, it can distract one's attention from the ad as well as negatively affect the memorizing of products and brands.
Until now, it has never been assumed that humor in ads may lead to implicit attitude change with the help of evaluative conditioning. To test the attitude change, reseches presented one group   a humorous version of the ad while another group was presented with a non-humorous version of the same ad.
