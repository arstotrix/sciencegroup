Nowadays technological advancement, especially in developed countries, has led to significant growth in health sectors. The average life expectancy is heightening which has also resulted in some problems, there are solutions.
       One of the first problems of the increasing average life expectancy is overpopulation. According to the statistics, in some developed countries over the last 20 years the number of people has increased almost in 2 times, this growth in its turn leads to a shortage of natural resources and inhabitancy. Another major problem is the governmental duty to pay pensions. For example, in numerous countries, pensions are paid much longer than ever before, and its size is significantly increasing, resulting in reduction of state’s treasury. The students and other social categories get less money from the government.
      It is important that action is taken to combat these problems. In order to deal with the first issue it’s efficient to use alternative resources, relocate people to the countryside and develop farming as one of the resources for the consumption. These measures can lead to the growth of living space and the increase of foodstuffs. Second problem demands the decrease of pensions and the raise of working age. This will help older people to work and pay taxes to the government and minimize the financial burden to other age groups.
      To conclude, today in developed society the impact of ageing population is inescapable. However, with the right action by individuals and governments it can be minimized.
