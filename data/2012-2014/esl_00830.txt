The graph provides information about how much money drivers from the United States and the United Kingdom spend on their petrol. All interviewed people were divided into three groups, based on their income : poorest, middle-income and richest.

The first thing to mention is a huge difference between the amount of money spent on petrol by the poorest group of drivers: drivers from the USA spent from 4 to 6 % of their income on petrol whereas for drivers from the UK this number is much less: only from 0,5 to 3 % of their money. Then two lines on the graph start to move closer to each other and at the edge between middle-income and the richest group, they cross at the level of approximately 4 per cent. However, after crossing the level of the richest people, the line for the USA's drivers begin to fall more intense than the one for UK's drivers. It is surprising because before that it was evident that drivers in the UK tend to spend more money on petrol than those from the USA.

To summarise, it is essential to say that there is a huge distinction between two countries: in the USA the less people earn, the more they spend on petrol, while in the UK the situation is absolutely opposite.
