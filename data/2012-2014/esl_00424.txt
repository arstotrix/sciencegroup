Abstract
Voice coarticulation in obstruent + labial nasal clusters in external sandhi position and within a word in Modern Standard Russian
Coarticulation is one of the phonetic features in Russian language that has a need of more detailed and precise examination and description. This would provide basics for further studies not only in phonetic area but in other various fields of Russian tongue.
The purpose of this course paper is to examine and comprehensively describe voice coarticulation in obstruent /p/ + labial nasal /m/ clusters in external sandhi position and within a word in pronunciation of several Russian informants. To make the research valid examples of words and word combinations are selected according to special rules. Above all, there is a need of examples where /pm/ would be between similar vowels in the same syllable in relation to accent. In addition, absence or presence of a phrase accent on one of the words should be concerned. On the whole, data that will be presented in the paper could be taken in account by scientists and researchers for more fundamental studies.
