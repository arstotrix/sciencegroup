I have been presented the chart showing popularity of certain places among three types of people: people born in Australia, new migrants born in English-speaking countries and new migrants born in other countries. The places were zoo, library, theatre and cinema.
The chart shows that the most popular place for all the groups is cinema. More than 50 percent of people in each group have visited it. It was the only place where those who born in Australia lead. New immigrants born in English-speaking countries were second. The second group of migrants went to the cinema rarely than the first two groups but , nevertheless, it was the second popular place to visit among them.
The least popular place for all of the groups was theatre. It was visited by less than 25 percent of people.
Zoo and library were in the middle. 
People born in Australia went to zoo and theatre more often than people of other groups. People not born in English-speaking countries were first in going to the library. More than 50 percent of them had been there.
