When tired and worn out what do we dream of? Often our only wish in this case is to go home. But what makes home special? There is the point of view that the interior design plays a large part in it.
To begin with, we are people and that is why we love beauty, we can even suffer in the name of beauty. Actually, unbeautiful is often annoying. Thus, we cannot get truly relaxed when something around looks unpleasant. That is why interior decorations are so important for most of us. Home should be the place there a person can chill out after a long day and it is possible when every detail of interior is one’s eyes feast. 
However, that is not true for people that are not predisposed to visual perception of the world. That people are so rational that the design means nothing for them. They are convinced that everything should be more convenient and efficient than beautiful. Although, it doesn’t work for me, I believe that this point of view makes a sense.
To sum up, well-being of most of us depends on how good our surrounding looks and, therefore, on interior decorations. The reason is that beauty makes us feel better. Neverthelss, there are people for whom design of the interior doesn’t mean anything, as they’re more practical than beauty-lovers.:)
