Nowadays with economic development people's needs and desires have been increasing. Wanting to have personal property, people buy new cars,cottages and ,in particular, habitation. There is an discussion/debate whether it is important for a city to have cheap houses with facilitiesor it is better to build expensive but well-organized and elegant dwelling.      In my opinion, there should be houses of different types   in a well-organized city with a good developing infrastructure. First of all,if only beautiful and well-designed houses are built, there is little chance for the younger generation to acquire and dispose of propertybecause it is expensive for them to buy elite habitation. In this case, young population has to rent a flat that nowadays also costs aconsiderable sum of money and content themselves with it. Secondly, existence of only cheap houses also has significant disadvantages.Inexpensive dwelling is easier to construct that means it is possible to build many houses of this type in a small area. From my point of view,it also provokes inconvenience for people: as an example, shortage of kindergartens, schools and playgrounds for children, and car parks in suchdistricts. Moreover, cheap buildings can have mistakes in planning that can cause problems with sewerage system, heating and etc.However, some people suppose that having different types of housing in one city can cause inequality that can lead to disproportionatedevelopment of districts. I think that quite the contrary inequality in a city allows people of different prosperity to have socio-economicbackgrounds, own place to live.To sum up, I would like to say there are different opinions about what kind of houses should be built in a city, but it is clear that a cityshould satisfy the requirements of different sufficiency people.
