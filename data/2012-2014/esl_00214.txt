It is said that life is a risk, but to what extent this statement is true? While some people think that it is almost impossible to become asuccessful person if you do not take any risk in your life, others consider risk not to be a noble deed.In the beginning, it is essential to realize that there are many different types of risk. Risk can be calculated or unjustified, high or low. Itis a risk to move into another town and it is also a risk to taste fugu but nobody will argue that one who tries to take chances eatingpoisonous fish is not a wise person whereas moving from one town to another is a very popular action. In my opinion, risk should always besomehow considered. I do not understand those who are playing in amusement arcade because it is only a matter of luck, it is practicallyimpossible to cheat the arcade machine so taking such risk is not a deliberate decision. On the other hand, there is also a poker which is agambling too, but it requires from its gamblers a good knowledge of math, psychology and probability theory to become a winner. So it is notonly an ability of taking risks which is important but also some other good qualities.All in all, risk is an everyday part of our life. Generally, most of our actions like choosing friends, school or university, going on holidaysor deciding to get a new job involve taking risks, but it is essential to think over your chances and possibilities. Risk is indispensible butit always should be considered and depends not only on your luck but also on the good sense and some practical knowledges.
