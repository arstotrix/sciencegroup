To be, or not to be, that is the question, says the opening phrase of the soliloquy in William Shakespeare's play Hamlet. Everybody in his or her life has to make thousands important decisions and choices. It is known from different cultures that risky people always score a success, but only one wrong decision can cancel all your luck. 
On the one hand, people usually don't like making serious, rash choices. Any thoughtless decision connects with an element of luck and this uncertainty scares ordinary and irresolute people. However, a famous proverb says nothing ventured, nothing gained. And I really believe, that risky people with a strong assertiveness are more successful in business, sports and studies; risk makes people free from daily superstitions. The history knows many great poets, actors and other well-known persons, who were famous for their risky doings. 
On the other hand, as I have mentioned, only one false step can ruins all people's hopes. If you always risk, the probability of losing will increase. To be successful, people should not do something they are unfamiliar with. And in my opinion, everybody has enough advantages that can help him or her to be successful in today's world.  In other words, reducing risks and enhancing individual's capability is the most important path to success. 
To conclude, from day to people face with difficult choices and there is no any doubt that we always do a lot of risks. But we should understand that not every risk lives up to our expectations. It can bring us money, popularity and freedom but it also can cause many troubles and ruins our life.
