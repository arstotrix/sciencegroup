If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologists classes, I would try to convey to them that a novel has its own set of requirements, laws of construction that have to be learnt. Students have to understand that just because they have read a lot of novels doesn't mean they can write one. Furthermore I would advice starting small and to carry a notebook everywhere and write down their observations. I believe that it is really important to practice everytime and don't be afraid to experiment because creative writing expresse the writer's feelingf and thoughts often in an unique way.
