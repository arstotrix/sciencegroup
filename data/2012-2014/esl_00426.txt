This course paper explores quite a relevant subject of actual sociolinguistics such as interaction between dialect and standard language. In particular, this variation between dialect phenomena and ones of standard language (for example, "оканье" and "аканье") is distinctly observed in the speech of a city.
In this course paper we investigate the variation between fricative and explosive sound [g] in the speech of urban population of Tula. As all previous researches were carried out in a whole region and described a lot of phenomena, in this analysis we aimed to focus on the distribution of one specific phenomenon in a city. Two objectives which we aspired to achieve were to establish the extent of presence of the fricative sound [g] in the speech of the city (doing percent calculation); and to analyze factors which can influence the speech, such as social class, education, place of birth etc.
