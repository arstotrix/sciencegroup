Transport has already taken a great part of our living and in future its influence is only going to increase. Owning to fast pace of life most people spend great amount of their time on transportation. It might be one of the main reasons why some people are concerned with the purposes and usage of transport in future. In my essay I would like to share some of my considerations about the possible and desired changes in this sphere of humans' life. 
To begin with I would like to argue that transport in future should be more environmentally friendly. Almost all the cars today are drawing petrol or diesel fuel and produce carbon dioxide and other harmful substances to the atmosphere. Moreover, oil from which petrol and diesel fuel are obtained is a non-renewable recourse and soon it will certainly run out. It's common knowledge that new types of electric vehicle had already been invented, although they are too expensive and as a result not spread enough. 
Another big problem today is permanent traffic congestions in every big city. This issue can be solved in many different ways but I'm fancy of suggesting the idea of creating such means of transport that won't require a track to ride. As far as I remember one of the science-fiction writer presenting the idea of creating cars that will move due to the terrestrial magnetic field. It might settle simultaneously the problem of air pollution and traffic jams. 
As we are living in the age of information technologies speed of movement has a great significance. I'm convinced that transport in future will be able to transport people as fast as information, for instance e-mails of messages in Skype, now. 
Nobody knows what may happen tomorrow, in two weeks, in couple of years, we can predict, though, and we are vigorous enough to influence on our future and make it better. It refers as well to all spheres of our life and to every person in particular.
