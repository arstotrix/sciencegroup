The graph and chart provide information on extinction rate in tropical forests and the types of threats plant life is under.
On the graph we can see, how level of threat to different forms of life in the tropics will change during the twenty first century. With the lowest number of extinct plants and animals (under 5,000 per million) in 2000, extinction rate will then proceed to a quick and steady growth that will continue for six decades. In 2060 it will reach its highest peak - 50,000 per million. After that year numbers will start to fall, decreasing to less than 30,000 per million.
Meanwhile, the pie chart shows what kinds of risks plants are exposed to. It can clearly be seen that human influence, with proportion reaching up to 81.3 percent, is much more destructive than natureâ€™s (which is only 18.7 percent). Amongst various types of human impact, various causes of plant extinction are farming (18.7 percent) and gathering harvest (14.4 percent).
Overall, extinction rate will reach incredibly high levels over the years and the main reason to that will be irresponsible behavior of the human kind.
