The two charts show the weight assessment taken from the inhabitants of Newtown, varying from different age groups, of the years 1950 and 2010. At a first glance we can clearly see that the number of obese people was much higher in 2010 than 1950 throughout all ages, while the number of underweight inhabitants was stronger in 1950.

People from 20 to 29 years old seem to be the most healthy: in 2010 the majority was of ideal weight, and following the same line we find no overweight nor obese people in the chart of 1950. On the contrary, the oldest population of Newtown is found to be the most unhealthy in terms of eating habits: in 2010 old people were mostly obese or overweight, while in 1950 more than 60% of the elderly was not of ideal weight.

It is possible to notice that in 1950 the number of inhabitants with ideal weight was fairly stable, going from 70% for people of age 20-29 to 50% for people from 60 to 69 years old. The same chart in 2010 is much more different: more than 70% for the young, but only a little 5% for the elderly.
