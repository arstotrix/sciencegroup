Do you like shopping? People's attitudes towards shopping have been changing dramatically through the history. At first, it was one of the daily choves. Nowadays it is often done just to have fun, for pleasure.
There is an opinion that it is a good tendency. For the most part I agree with this point of view. First of all, shopping can help one have a good time and overcome stress. Secondly, if one spends a lot of money on shopping as a hobby, he or she will probably be stimulated to work more, gett better results and therefore earn more money. Finally, people can go shopping together and sociolize.
My opponents will contradict my statement; they think that enjoying shopping as a hobby is a wrong way because this activity needs a lot of money, while that is true, I think it depends on where the money comes from. If you earn it yourself, how you spend it is totally up to you. However, for instance a trend of doing shopping as a hobby is bad for those students who get their money from their parent or other relatives. So, obviosly, there are some life sitations when shopping for fun is a negative trend.
All in all, I believe that if poeople earn their money by themselves, it is, without any doubt, okay to shop for pleasure. This process can give a lot of positive emotions for a person.
