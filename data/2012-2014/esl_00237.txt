Nowadays more and more people prefer hybrid vehicles, which use both petrol and electricity, than cars that use only petrol. Given data show some changes in global hybrids sales.
During 2006 the 360,000 hybrid vehicles were sold all over the world, US sold about 250,000 cars while Japan and the rest of the world sold slightly more than 50,000. In 2007 US reach an all-time high of - 350,000 sold vehicles, but at the same time the number of hybrid vehicle sales increases in Japan - 70,000 and in other countries the number of sales was about 80,000. 2008 shows that the number of US sales fall to slightly more than 300,000 and Japan with the rest of the world continue their growth. Japan drops to 90,000 sales and other countries reach about 100,000 sales. In 2009 the world made progress (the 740,000 hybrids were sold) with the help of Japan, that reached a peak of about 330,000 vehicle sales. The number of sales in America reduced to about 280,000 and the rest of the world reaches 120,000 sales. 
This data show us the sudden change of hybrid vehicle sales in Japan in 2009. I assume that this can be connected with the opening of hybrids' production in the country or this dramatic change can be caused by new laws concerning the increase of taxes on carbon emission. That is why people prefer using hybrid cars more. Speaking about US, it reaches a peak in 2007 but then the number of its sales reduces by about 130,000 during three years. I suppose this can be explained by means of the economic crisis of 2008 that made a lot of machine works economize, for instance, General Motors was on the verge of bankruptcy.
According to these diagrams I can assume that the popularity of hybrid vehicles will increase in future, because of the cheaper service and producing less emission.
