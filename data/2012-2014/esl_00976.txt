Dear Olga Ilinichna,
I was hoping you would be willing to write me a letter of recommendation.  Could I ask you to note my diligence and my unbelievable progress in the learning of languages? I would be also grateful if you declare my punctuality and impressive energies during your lessons. Thanks for advance.
Sincerely,
Anna
