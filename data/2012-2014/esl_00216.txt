As we can see on the charts, the number of complaints regarding environmental damage has just been increasing for the last four years and by nowit reached its peak at 60 thousands complaints a year. The most surprising thing is that this number is not related with the chart in which wecan see the number of waste in tones produced by the UK industries. For example, while the "waste" chart reached its all-time high in 2010 andthe difference between the amounts of waste produced in 2009 and in 2010 is a 500 thousands tones (which is really an abrupt movement), thisprocess did not have any impact on the "chart of complaints" as it might have been expected. The number of complaints increased only in 10thousands between 2009 and 2010 which is not significant because the same situation was between 2010 and 2011 whereas the number of waste inthat time declined by 200 thousands tones. What is about connections between "waste" chart and the diagram showing the level of investment inwaste disposal, we can see that when the level of investment remains as it was in 2010 in comparison with 2009, the amount of produced wasteincreases, while when the level on investment increases - the amount of waste goes down. So we can see that these two processes areinterconnected.
