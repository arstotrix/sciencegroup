In all spheres of human activities there always have been those who carry out their tasks excellent, those who manage with the tasks and those who don't cope at all. So are they in schools. But school is in many points the basis of the whole future human life, the mode of thoughts, ideas and work. At this point it should be carefully thought out how to provide to students with as much opportunities as possible. May the division according to the academic level be one of the ways to improve one's educational process or it will make more harm than good?
On the one hand, excellent students could significantly benefit having classmates with the same abilities, goals and interests, also they will have harder competition which is a good point. But at the same time such children will be less prepare to the realities of life.
On the other hand, pupils put in the weaker classes without an example to aspire and any expectations from adults will be stuck in their level since the early age. Though to be lifted up to the higher class can as well be a good motivation - in this point everything depends from a particular person. 
To sum up I would like to say that in my opinion to classify children at an early age, while they are still very capable of changes both for the better and the worse is an intolerable idea which must never be put into practice.
