There are more than 7,000 languages in our world. Some of them are similar to each other, some are radically different. Interestingly, does the language influence on human and his worldview? Lera Boroditsky, an American psycholinguist, decided to study this issue and conduct an experiment. In the experiment, English speakers and Indonesian speakers were involved. They were shown three different pictures: a man about to kick a ball, the same man having just kicked a ball and another man about to kick a ball. Speakers were asked to choose the two most similar images. As a result, many Indonesians have chosen pictures with the same man, and the British have chosen another pair of images: with men about to kick a ball. As we can see, language can affect the mind of people and their worldview. Carriers of different languages think differently. People's consciousness is formed through language. In his speech the man fixes his thoughts, feelings, and thus he has the ability to analyze everything he says. Features of perception of the world and space in general entail a particular perception of time. As it is known in the Indonesian language verbs do not change either in tense or in gender, not at all. While in English tenses are one of the most important parts of grammar. Perhaps this is the key reason for the differences of perception of the world and space Indonesian and English. In conclusion, I would like to add that it is a very interesting experiment on the idea and I hope that the research scientists will continue throughout the years.
