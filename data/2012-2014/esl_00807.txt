In our world of technologies where everything is done just to reduce the amount of humanâ€™s efforts it is quiet easy to forget some basic knowledge and skills.
Modern technologies are getting into our life so deeply now that it can cause a lot of changes in our way of life. For example, the Internet, which is named one of the most significant inventions of all time, surely, makes the life easier but in the same time it makes people behave like robots. With the appearance of the Internet and all the opportunities that it provides us with humanity started to be more active but in a completely different way. All the variety of actions is now available by one click and it causes a lot of problems. People are forgetting how to communicate in person. Their own world that they create in the Internet helps them to run away from reality and any conflicts that they can be faced with. There is also a very common thing that a lot of people suffer from obsession with their phones, they become helpless without their smart phones. Phone can be a source of writing, reading, calculating, searching, listening music, watching videos, etc. Smart phones and any other gadgets are called to replace a human brain by more perfect brain of a computer which is able to do the actions listed above quicker and with fewer mistakes. 
Personally, I consider the statement mentioned in the introduction to be completely true. Nowadays people are forgetting being humans, they forget that nature has already gifted them a brain, that should be used for all things that now technologies do.
