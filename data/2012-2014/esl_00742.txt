The charts demonstrate information about plant species that are at risk of extinction around the world. They also show particular parts of environment where the risk is relevant and different levels of risk.
The most positive fact that can be seen from the first chart is that more than a half of plants are in safe. However, there still is the risk that almost 46% of plant species might be endangered, this percentage  also contains plants that are critically endangered (3,92%) and just endangered (6,92%). 
Another most striking feature is that there are much more species that are at risk in tropics. In tropical wet forest  63% of plants species can extinct and the same thing is going to happen with 12,1% of those of tropical dry forest. 
As far as we can see from the charts, there is a real risk for a lot of plants species. This statistic should persuade people to act with care to environment and also to provide some species with immediate protection.
