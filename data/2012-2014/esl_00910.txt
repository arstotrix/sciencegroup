Linguistics researches usually reveal very interesting and unexpected facts about peoples'

minds and influence of the language on it. One of these experiments has been held by Lera 

Boroditsky.

When I read about her experiment I noticed two main points that could possibly 

differentiate and describe the choices made by speakers of Indonesian and English languages. 

These three photos con be divided in two groups (one containing two similar photos and the 

other containing third photo) if we mark the object and subject to be more important for 'similar' 

photos or if we choose the situation to be the leading criteria.

I think that the structure of Indonesian language formed the minds of its' native speakers 

the way that presence of the same ball and the same man made first two pictures similar. The fact 

that selected photos contained two situations which can be put in a raw following one another 

and thus create a kind of plot reveals that it makes stronger connection for Indonesian people.

On the contrary for the native English speakers two photos describing the same situation 

(men being about to kick the ball) are more similar because action is more important criteria then 

participants. In English both pictures will be described with the use of the same tense and 

possibly that had defined peoples' choice. 

I am not familiar with Indonesian grammar but I guess that two actions on the pictures 

following one another can be described with the same tense or maybe with the tenses creating 

very strong relation among them rather than two pictures representing two different people doing 

the same thing.
