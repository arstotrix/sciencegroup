Absurdity as an object of research.
This paper considers the phenomenon of absurdity and the peculiarities of human response to uncertainty. Modern theories of psychology claim that a person, who faces a situation of absurdity, tends either to find meaning content in it, or withdraws from it. The main aim of this work is to determine which of these two decisions is more frequent. The probed approach includes the following steps: (1) determining and interpreting the concept of "absurd"; (2) studying human response to the situation of absurdity; (3) developing an experimental procedure that identifies the reaction to what people tend to choose in a situation of absurdity: the search for meaning, or withdrawal.
