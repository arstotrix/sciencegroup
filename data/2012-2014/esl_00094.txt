Hermann Brandsatter, Werner Guth "A psychological approach to individual differences in intertemporal consumption patterns".
Abstract.
     In psychology, saving behavior in consumption is  an interpersonal decision of conflict between present and future needs which depends on life expectancies and available resources for satisfying needs.
     The present work examines the influence of personality differences on the amount of consumption depending on life expectancy changes.
     The paper uses a personality questionnaire to evaluate such individual differences as self-control, emotional stability, extroversion, and tough-mindedness and an experimental design to model the changes in life expectancy.
     The study results indicate that anxious subjects (emotionally unstable introverts) are the most sensitive to changes in life expectancy, whereas emotionally stable extroverts are the least sensitive. In addition, people high in self-control prefer the averaging payoff format while people low in self-control choose the random format. 
     In addition, the paper contains preliminary experiment on the personality dimension of tough-mindedness, dependence of payoff on different score, and learning from the experience.
