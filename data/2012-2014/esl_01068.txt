Nowadays many people think that it is important to have a job that provides with a high salary. Others believe that first of all one should enjoy his or her job. To my mind, there are a lot of reasons why job should be pleasurable. So let us consider the facts.
To begin with, job is one of the most important parts of our lives as we spent a lot of time on it. I believe that it is almost impossible to consider it just like a means of earning the money. If you do not enjoy what you do, it will make you feel annoyance; and ideal job should bring you satisfaction instead of that.
On the other hand, only satisfaction from your job is not enough for a happy life. It is really important to follow your passion without compromising the basic human needs. In our consumer world nothing is free; undoubtedly, life is easier for those who have plenty of money as they can buy what they want and not to think about whether they can afford something or not. However, if you are determined enough in doing what you love and you are a specialist in your working area, reward will not keep you waiting.  The public in general tend to believe that people who love their work have more chances for the career growth and consequently, for a higher salary.
To draw the conclusion, I can say that doing a job that pays just enough to meet your needs is better than striving to earn as much money as possible and living unhappy and unsatisfied with your work, as proverb says ‘Money does not bring happiness’.
