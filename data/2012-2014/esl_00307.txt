Abstract
Nowadays the requirement for corpora studies is becoming more and more frequent, corpora are used in a great variety of spheres, such as studying, editing and correction of text, sociolinguistics and others. Despite the fact, there are many languages, which have no proper corpora. Unfortunately, the Modern Greek is among them. For now there are two big corpora for Modern Greek language: one of them has no grammatical annotation and the other has incomplete annotation, is unbalanced and, furthermore, does not have free access.
The current work is related to the new corpus, which is at present still unfinished. The work on nominal lexicon has already been done there and now the corpus needs verbal lexicon. The main objective of this work is to find an appropriate way for automatical compiling of dictionary of Greek verbs.
At first the analysis of Greek verbal grammar has been done. Then the data received after verbal analysis was compared to the nominal and adverbial grammar in the search for homonymy between affixes. The affixes that are most frequent in verbs, but not as frequent or absent in other parts of speech were chosen for gathering verbs. Apart from that, the context was taken into account: the most frequent adjoining lexemes for verbs were chosen for the purpose of escaping homonymy.
The work has been done with the use of Python programming language. In the end, a lot of work has been done for the purpose of making a dictionary of Greek verbal lexicon.
