If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologist classes, I would firstly teach them to think before write something, to understand primarily what they want to write. I would show them how to compose plans, on my opinion itâ€™s very useful, because it would help to not lose the ideas, when they appear too fast, and also help to construct logical text without rewriting it a thousand times. Moreover, I would explain them that there are a lot of styles of words, and there are words, which have the same meaning, but in a case it needs to use a word, which would be absolutely inconvenient in another situation.
