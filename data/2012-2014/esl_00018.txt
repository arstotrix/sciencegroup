Several days ago I met my ex-classmate whom I hadn't seen for a whole summer. We were really excited to see each other, and a long conversation started. We were discussing various things like our studies and our  mates, and then she started speaking about how she had spent her summer. She said that she had seen her granny, who lives in Saint Petersburg. Then she described  me the days spent in this wonderful city. Then she told me how she had attended a concert of a rock band. I was really surprised to find out that it had been the concert of one of the   rock bands in the world! She was talking excitedly of the songs they had played during the concert, about their light show and how they had been keeping the attention of the listeners for two hours. After that she smiled happily and added that a well-known newspaper had published the concert review and she was really surprised to find her own face among the spectators in  . Then she showed me a few snaps taken by her, and I realized that my old friend had  summer.
