The graphs provide us information about the scale of danger enthreating plant and animal life and about its possible causes. The prediction of the whole situation is quite frustrating, that's why it's worth having a closer look to try to find some salvation for our nature.
The extinction of species is going to continue rising until the 2060th when the situation is going to reach its peak. The number of extinct plants and animals is never going to hit the point of 50 thousands per million again after it, so it's rather interesting to find out the reasons for such a stop in this disaster.
The second graph present us much more interesting information than the first one. It appears that not only different types of human impact can actually endanger the natural life. About 18% of events causing the extinction of species are happening for some reasons not depending on the human at all. But at the same time nearly 82% of present and future problems of endangered species wouldn't appear unless the nature struggle our influence. The main threats seem to be connected to our agriculture and progress of different industries.    
Comparing to the destiny of plants and animals in five nearest decades, the further situation is going to nake things better. But may be the reason of decreasing number of extinctions per million is the possibility of very few of them still existing on Earth by that time?
