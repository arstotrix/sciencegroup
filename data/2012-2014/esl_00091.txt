Is it more important to get news fast or accurately?
     Undoubtedly, the media sphere is growing pretty fast and sometimes it's hard to control this process. With the of gadgets which have a variety of opportunities, it has become simpler to share the information (no matter of what kind). Thus, people start being accustomed to such actions. If one has travelled somewhere, he/she will rush to the computer  and upload his photos or change the status message. This how I see the youth. 
     As we have  of people of this kind, the amount of uploaded information is really big. Thereby, the citizen journalism is a new means of managing the information. This is a fantastic strategy of collecting information and sharing  with others. However, information   it  be?
     To my mind, it is better when news is both fast and accurate. If the main aim is to receive the information then, yes, it is better to get them fast. But if the content is more important (I hope so), then it is better to get verified data. Maybe a problem like this could be solved by establishing a special agency whose responsibility would be controlling the stream of information, on the one hand, and  processing, on the other hand.
