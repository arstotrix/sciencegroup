The fear can paralyze but in most cases it makes us undertake some measures to avoid the situations or things that we are afraid of even if this thing is natural and every living being will undergo it. “Modern technologies and breakthroughs now can postpone ageing, prolong youth but nothing can cancel death,” – say most of the people. Actually, such a system that can conserve consciousness exists and since the year 2004 when it was first tested the brain-computer interface has been developing quite fast. The conception according to which brain will get an ability to operate with the external devices dates back 40 years and today signals that our brain sends to our body can be interpreted in the program code and, for example, sent to the robotic hands or legs making them operate the way brain wants. This software is now used to create the platforms for future generation gaming to get a commercial profit from this idea but in fact such an invention with a help of robot-building will soon introduce a brand new fully robotized bodies for our brains to operate. It means that the actual death will be defeated as our weak and prone to damage bodies will be replaced by the robot skeletons.
