This table shows the number of people who are studying at Bristol University and the number of people of each gender as well. Also, it shows the distance that students come from, divided into two categories: within 30 miles of Bristol in 1928, 1958, and 2008.
The main feature of the table is an increase of students during 80 years, which can be explained by the population growth. The number of men in Bristol University was more significant in 1928 and 1958. Moreover, we can see that the percentage of women was slightly decreased from 42 percent in 1928 to 32 percent in 1958. The interesting fact that in 2008 the number of women got to the lead position at the first time and it is 54 percent of all students.
Talking about the distance of students come from, we can clearly see that the number of students which came from within 30 miles of Bristol is significantly decreased over the years from 50 percent to 1-2 percent. On the contrary, the number of overseas students has been increased from 5 percent in 1928 to 6 percent in 1958 and then it increased very significantly to 28 percent in 2008.
The main conclusion we can make from the table is that the number of women and the number of students from overseas increase over the time.
