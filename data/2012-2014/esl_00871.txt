There is too much emphasis on winning in sports today. Discuss.
When i was younger, my grandmother have always told me that the important thing is not to win, but to take part. Nowadays, when i hear about some championship or World Cup it seems to me that the only thing that counts is the victory, like all the athletes never had such grandmother, who could teach them not to focus too much on winning. So, what’s the reason of the emphasis on winning in sports today?
Firstly, victory can be associated with some kind of promotion, like a title or prize. Thus, participating itself loses its value, it’s not anymore a purpose, but the way to achieve the goal.
Secondly, for someone to win means to push the matter through. It’s naturally that whatever we do, we don’t want to throw some work unfinished. 
In my point of view there’s no problem in desire to win until it reaches by a fair play. I’m against all the doping and frauds that sportspersons use to deceive rivals and to win, because i think that it needs to be a level playing field for everyone, otherwise, i see no point in such competitions. 
However, unfortunately for many of the current athletes, sport is the way to make money and it loses its competitive nature.
To sum up with,the problem is not in the desire to win, but in the desire to make a profit. And this problem is spread not only among sportspersons, but among many of the current people.
