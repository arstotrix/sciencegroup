Sorry, I haven't written in my blog for ages. The only excuse - I was extremely busy. Good news! I have decided that the title ofy new book will be "Madvoman in Attic". What do you think? And now the ghost lives not on the top floor, but in attic. The hero hears footsteps above him, he goes to attic and sees a young girl. I don't know what will happen next, but I'm sure I'll tell you next blog.
Today I finished Chapter 5. Hero's name is now Peter Youngblood. He's an architect so he understands how the houses are built. Oh, and I need someone who knows about the ghost. Maybe it will be the person who sold the house. Isn't that too easy, what do you think?
The publishers are happy because Chapters 1 and 2 are already finished and the deadline is now on February. That's why I'm a lot happier.
