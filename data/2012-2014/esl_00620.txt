One of the most pressing ecological problems nowadays is the reduction of the variety of living species. The graph shows a formidable tendence of dying-out per million species per decade from 2000 to 2100, while the pie chart, demonstrating  different dangers to plant life, confirms a well-known idea  that human influence is the main factor of this ecological disaster. 
The predictions, given by the graph, follow the accelerating from year to year trend of extinction 5,000 species per million in 2000 to extinction of  50,000 species per million in 2060, and after that point we can see a great drop, which start an opposite tendence of slowing extinction, proceeding to the index of less than 30,000 extinctions in 2100.
The pie chart provides an information about 81,3 per cents of human activity, threatening to plant life, where the most noticeable theats are agriculture - 18,7 per cents and harvesting - 14,4 per cents.  At the same time, natural events seem to be only 18,7 per cents of dangerous factors to plant life, i.e. 7 percents of natural disasters and 11,7 per cents of other natural incidents. 
Overall, the extinction problem is prognosed to stagnate after 2060, and this may be connected to the shortening of different dangers to plant life,  especially human-provided, which are the most theatening nowadays.
