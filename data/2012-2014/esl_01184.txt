It is argued that the mood of the employees has a great impact on the company’s extents of success. People who come up with such idea base their opinions on the overcome of their companies’ work and how it depends on their employees’ attitude to life. On the other hand, others insist that this thesis is absolutely irrational and has no evidence at all.
Everyone would definitely associate a grim boss with various failures of the company he possesses. As well as a cheerful employee would be considered to be a leader of a successful business. Indeed, it seems to be logically reasonable. Moreover, one would likely guess.  It is a common idea that believing in our power can cause miracles. Therefore cheering up can help one succeed.
However, does this influence really always work that way? There is a controversial opinion stating that success of a company, vice versa, changes the mental state of its leader. This could also explain those associations described in the previous paragraph. To many people this way of thinking seems more essential. 
To conclude, every person has a right to choose which way to think. Current argument is not crucially important. Generally, it is based on people’s opinions, not even facts.
