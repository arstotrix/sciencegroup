Once upon a time when I was a little girl (about 7 – 8 years) my mom had took in the library one book for me. It was named “Dinka” by Valentina Oseeva. Until now, I sometimes ask myself “What if it would not have happened?” That book was my first big thick book that I read and that has remained in my heart forever.  I read it only one time but I remember every event in that book very well to this day. 
The main character of the Oseeva`s book was a foolhardy girl who never sat still and who always looked for some adventure. Oh, I was so not like her, even though we were the same age. Dinka was my idol. I dreamed to like that little girl, do absurd things, endure punishment for my antics, make bold actions, learn from my mistakes, to live actively and desperately, as if it was the last day of my life. Being a modest quiet girl, I wanted to overcome my fear of stormy life full of different changes. Every day, I told myself it was time to come out of the shadows and to "become an actor, not a spectator", and do wonders. Now, after almost 10 years, I can safely say that I am on the right way. Today I am not the modest little girl who trembled when she heard her name. No. Now I am another one thanks to the dreams and the goals achieved that moved to Moscow and entered one of the most prestigious universities in the country.
So, what if my mom hadn`t took that wonderful book that helps me build my life? I don`t know… Maybe I just wouldn`t be what I am now?
Thank you, Mom. Thank you, Dinka.
