Introduction to the course paper "Conceptualization of 'pride' in the French language".
There is a significant number of words, which describe emotions in different languages, and the notions of the certain emotional categories vary in many ways. Emotions are not universal throughout the world, for example, it is hard to describe a Russian feeling 'соскучиться' for a foreigner. Moreover, one language may have only one word for the certain emotion, while other has 20 words, describing various types of the same feeling.
Although some linguists, like Anna Wierzbicka, have succeeded in discovering the distinctions between 'emotional' words in one language and denoting them throughout semantic primes, there are not enough studies about how the words in different languages correlate with each other. Thus, it might be helpful to create a database of emotions, in which every user can find not only the difference between the words 'fondness' and 'tenderness' in English, but also some illustrative examples, which help to compare the use of these words with the application of the Russian word 'нежность'. Therefore, the words describing emotions can be compared with each other and unique cultural features of the different languages can be discovered. 
The main aim of this work is to create a semantic 'map' of the emotional category 'pride' in the French language. It means that we will find all words representing 'pride' and then distinguish them into some groups, depending on their semantic features, such as the strength and depth of the feeling or the validity of the pride from the listener's point of view. After discovering semantic similarities and differences, we will make a comparative analysis of application of the words for 'pride' in the Russian and in the French languages. Thus, the small part of emotional database will be fulfilled.
