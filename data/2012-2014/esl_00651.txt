Nowadays in our world of consuming shopping plays a great role in people's lives. Today more and more people tend to spend a significant part 
of their free time in shopping malls. Some people even regard it as a hobby. However, this tendency may have its pluses and minuses.
One of the main advantages of shopping is pleasure it brings to people. Most women would rather spend all the leisure time on looking for a dress. 
Also, finding what you have been looking for put you in right mood. What's more, shopping may help in developing your own style, improving your 
taste. Finally, it may help you work on your self-discipline.
On the other hand, drawbacks of shopping as a hobby seem to outweigh the benefits. First of all, shopping requires money and having a hobby like 
that may undermine family budget. Furthermore, looking through all those glamour magazines may also hit your psycological state. In the long run 
you waste considerable amount of time on something you do not even need. For example, you may spend the day with the ones you cherish or doing 
something important. Instead, you go to the shopping centre and waste your money. Finally, all these have an impact on youngsters that are easily influenced.
To sum up, weaknesses of shopping as a hobby do outweight the strength. While it cheers you up, it also puts to test your self-discipline and your pocket.
