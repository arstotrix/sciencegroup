In the Russian language there are several suffixes which can be used for formation of nomina actionis, the nouns which denote process (e.g. "страдать" - "страдание"). However, the rules of choosing a particular suffix and semantic differences between derivatives have not been systematically described.

In my research I investigate the first conjugation type (-ать verbs) in the Russian language excluding j-subtype (e.g. "читать") and focus on nomina actionis ending at -(н)ие. The aim of the research is to find morphonological and semantic regularities which influence the choice of suffix -(н)ие.
