Some people think that it is more important that cities provide cheep housing and facilities, while others think it is worth spending money onwell-designed buildings that look beautiful.Nowadays the question of what is more important the beauty of the city or the cost of dwelling is a popular theme for discussions.In my opinion the best solution would be building nice, beautiful cheap houses, but it is probably found impossible. That is why I reallybelieve that the housing, or at least some of it, must be cheap. Some people might not care about the way their house looks in the citylandscape, but they always care about space, warmth and location.Another point to be made is that people should be provided with the choice, so that if someone wants to spend money on an expensive, but well-desined house they can find an area with such buildings, but if someone cannot afford such luxury they would be able to find a cheaper variant.Some people might say that such distinction creats social inequality and destroys the view and city's prestige, but I think it helps people ofall incomes have a place to live of their choice. Moreover, different types of houses often brings the local colour in the city landscape.To sum up, I would like to say that big cities cannott afford to have only nice expensive buildings or only cheap and ugly ones anyway, butthere is always a way to find a compromise.
