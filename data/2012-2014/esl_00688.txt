Some people claim that it is better for children to begin learning a foreign language at primary school rather than secondary school, but I do not agree with this opinion.
I believe that there are several reasons to prove this point of view. Firstly, it is in the children's nature that they reject what they are asked to do. For a example, children never want toeat porrige, go to school, do their homework and housework; the same happens with foreign languages, if they don't interest a kid from the beginning, this very child might hate foreign languages for the entire life. They're just too complex and unusual.
Secondly, it is the fact that you don't need 10 or more years to learn a foreign language in childhood and adolescence. Some people may object that learning something for 10 years is always better then learning it for 5 years, but we are talking about children here and it's absolutely not obvious.
I myself make a perfect example, unlikely most of my friends, whose parents forced them to study foreign languages in really early age, I started learning English at about 11 or 12 years. And during my English classes these frinds of mine were really reluctant and idle to do exercises and homework as if they hated this subject already. And on the contrary I was eager to learn new facts about English because it was a real fun. And now, looking back on my experience, I am really glad that I started learning English later than most people nowadays do.
So, I belive that children during primary school should really take their time and have fun instead of unillingly learn things, that they may later hate for the entire life.
