    Some people think that cities should provide cheap housing and facilities, while others think that it's worth spending money on well-designed                                                                                                                   buildings that look beautiful.There is no doubt different people have different priorities in their lives according to their social status, wealth and a lot of other things.Some of them prefer to pay more for the aesthetics, while others think that saving money is far more important, when we are talking abouthousing and facilities. And this problem can hardly be considered controversial and discussable, since the city government is usually able toprovide both types of buildings and satisfy everybody.However, certain troubles can appear. Nowadays a lot of people are concerned about the appearance of the city in the whole. They are afraid thathigh-rise buildings in the center of the city ruin the gorgeous old look of the previous centuries. These people even call living blocks'monsters'. Of course, their concern is easy to understand and share - this is the reason living blocks should be situated in sleeping quartersof the city and not in the historic center, but it is definitely not the reason to eliminate them all. In fact, all the people would preferbeautiful buildings to live in instead of standard and dull blocks many of us have now, but not so many of them can afford a well-designedhouse. So, if we remember that the main goal of the city government is to provide as many citizens as they can with housing and facilities, wecan understand that it is impossible to focus just on the aesthetic needs of people.To draw a conclusion, I would like to say that there is only one way to easily solve these kinds of problems: you should respect the needs ofother people. And it all will be settled.
