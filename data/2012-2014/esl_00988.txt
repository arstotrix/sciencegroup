The parents' and children's problem is always one of the most difficult and main questions human's life. Very often this problem stems discord between them. Basically, it refers to upbringing of children and their parents. Mothers and fathers don't understand wishes and ideas of their child, they endeavore to impose their views on life. Children, in their turn, believe that they are independent enough to make their own desisions, so don't listen their parents, do what do they want and make a lot of mistakes, but, on the other hand, fails teach us to live and don't make mistakes anymore.
I think that parents should be more attentive to their children. They are adalt and more smart.
