The table which provides information about student enrolments at Bristol University has, indeed, some interesting features. Firstly, we can see that a number of female students has decreased, comparing 1928 and 1958. It is 42% against 32% . The opposite situation appears among male students. By 1958 the figures have changed from 58% to 68%. Remarkably, that in 2008 the percentage of enrolled girls is higher then the percentage of boys. It is 54% against 46%. Moving to students who came from within 30 miles of Bristol we notice a sharp decrease. Comparing 1928 and 2008, the figures have fallen from 50% to 1-2%. But what impresses the most is the percentage of students who came from overseas. The numbers are on the increase. By 2008 the figures have reached 28%. What is more, enrolled students came from 98 countries by 2008. To sum up, it is easy to see, that students who live far from Bristol University do not prefer to study there, but students from other contries do.
