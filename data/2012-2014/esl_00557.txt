The bar charts below gives the information about weight assessment of inhabitants of different age in Newtown for the periods of 1950 and 2010.
In 1950 the number of Newtown citizens of all ages who had the ideal weight assessment was prevalent. It was 50% and higher. In 2010 the percentage of the inhabitants with ideal weight whose age was from 30 to 69 became lower and it varied from different age groups.
It is clearly marked that in 2010 among the people aged from 40 to 69 there were more people who suffered from obesity. On the contrary, in 1950 the Newtown inhabitants of the same age had minimal percentage of obesity.
A more detailed look on the bar chart reveals that for both periods the number of overweight and underweight people of different ages fluctuated. However, in 1950 there were more people of all ages who were underweight than overweight people, while in 2010 this situation was completely opposite.
