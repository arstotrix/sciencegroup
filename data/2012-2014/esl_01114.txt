People from some countries prefer to start education of their children at the age of 4, but people from other countries do not agree with it and keep their children at home until 7 or 8 years.
Many countries nowadays become industrial and the culture and customs of the family change. Our life becomes faster and parents have not got enough time to take care of their child or children until they become 7 years old. This can do the school and others courses. Also, as there are a lot of technologies around children, they develop faster and need not sit at home so much time. 
In other countries on the contrary think that children need more time before going to school. Modern family does not consist of 10 or 15 persons, there are only 3 or 4 people in it. So, it is easier to look after children as the number of them is not more than 2 or 3. Moreover, they think that knowledge that is given at school, when children are so young, is not useful and irrelevant to them. Love and care that is given to them by their parents is not comparable with acts of teachers and other non-native people at school.
In addition, the choice to send their children to school is only parents’ decision. From country to country this choice differs, but for me – the Russian human with strong family ties – it is obviously that sending children to school at 7 is much more better than doing it at 4.
