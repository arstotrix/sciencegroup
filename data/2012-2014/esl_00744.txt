I've tried to do a couple of writing tasks 1 in the textbook. Here is one from page 15.

The graph illustrates the comparison between the amounts of male and female students graduated from Canadian Universities in 1992-2007 period.

In 1992 there were almost a 100000 female graduates, while only 70000 man graduated at the same time. After that, both indexes were slowly increasing, resulting in 105000 female and 76000 male graduates in 1995. However, by 1998 the amount of graduates got down and became the same as in 1992. Nevertheless, afterwards both indexes started to increase very quickly, despite a small drop in amount of male graduates in 2001.

In 2007 there were almost 1,5 times more female graduates and although male graduation index did not get as high it still got up to 95000.
