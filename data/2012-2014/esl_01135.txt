There is a positive and a negative view on globalization and they both seem reasonable to me.
On the one hand, globalization enhances international communication and erases cultural barriers. Therefore, it helps to achieve mutual understanding for it makes values universal. Thus, globalization leads to the unification of the world. Moreover, it leads to standardisation which is the process of developing and implementing technical standards. Undoubtedly, it is really convenient as, for example, a person does not have to buy everything new to stay on holidays or to live in another country.
On the other hand, globalization is a threat to national identity. As it was already stated, it erases cultural values. Thus, globalization erases cultural specifics and leads to the loss of individual customs and traditions.
In conclusion, it is hard to say unambiguously if globalization is good or not. The issue is that we should realize that globalization helps us to understand other nations better but we still should preserve our national identity.
