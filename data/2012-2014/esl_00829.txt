The table represents the statistics concerning student enrolments at Bristol University observing three points of time: the beginning of the 20th century (year 1928), its approximate middle (year 1958) and the 21st century (year 2008). It can easily be seen that the amount of students entering the University highly increased, but the point is that there are few more details that are quite interesting to consider. 
First of all, the greatest change was made by time to areas where students come from. While only half of them were travelling for distances further that 30 miles to enter university, the total number of such people has come by now to 98-99%, and up to 28% of them today are from another countries. Shockingly, the amount of these countries is now 98, while in 1928 there were only 3 of them.
Second, the changes occurred in the male/female diversity. If we take a close look at the percentages, we will see that though in the middle of the 20th century males were prevailing over female students even more intensively than in its beginning, by 2008 the trend has turned upside down, and in the 21st century females make even more than a half of all Bristol students (54%).
To conclude, time has made a lot of changes to Bristol University and to the kinds of students who enter it. However, some certain trends can certainly be found out, and it may be very interesting to analyze in historical terms.
