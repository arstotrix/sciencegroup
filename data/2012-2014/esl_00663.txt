Nowadays most people adore doing shopping. They can just walk among shops and boutiques with pleasure and fun. Shopping is not a routine anymore, for most people it is a chance to have a rest from a routine. 
As for me, I’m sure, that such way of doing shopping is a good tendancy. First of all, when you are doing shopping, you can communicate with different types of people. For example, with people who are working at shops, with relatives and even with friends. Besides, it is a great way to keep in contact with people and also do a domestic task.
More than that, shopping helps a person to be in a good fit. It is not an easy thing to walk a lot in order to find something that a person needs very much. Moreover, a person who is keen on shopping always carries large bags. That’s why he or she has to have strong legs and arms.
On the other hand, shopping with fun has a disadvantage. If you like shopping and don’t really have a lot of money but you want a thing, that you couldn’t afford so much and despite of all the obstacles you buy it. This situation means that the person depends on shopping, the person is a shopaholic. Yhis type of people have a lot of problems, they need help. They do shopping with fun, but they can’t stop to wasting money.
Ti sum up, shopping is a part of our everyday life. It seems to me, in order to do it right, we should do shopping not only with fun but also with a sense of what we want to buy and what we can.
