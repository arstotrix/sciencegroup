The synonymy of verbs with and without '-ся' suffix in modern Russian.
Despite extensive studies of Russian reflexive verbs ([Gerritsen 1990],[Богуславский 1962], [Князев 2007], [Сай 2008], [Янко-Триницкая 1962]), there is a significant gap in description of one particular type. These are verbs, which are synonymous to their non-reflexive pairs (e.g. белеть-белеться, хвастать-хвастаться). Although such synonymy is mentioned in different Russian grammars, such as [Князев 2007], [Розенталь 1967], [Русская Корпусная Грамматика], and there is neither a full list of such verb pair or description of semantic types of verbs in which the addition of suffix -ся does not result in significant semantic shifts.
The purpose of this research is threefold: to compile a comprehensive list of such verbs, to explain which semantic types of verbs allow to add the suffix with such meaning and to provide a systematic description of semantic and syntactic differences between the synonyms in the pairs. It also contains a supposition of why some particular verbs have synonymous reflexive pairs and other have not.
