The bar charts show the percentage of obese, overweight, underweight inhabitants of Newtown and the ones having ideal weight in 1950 and in 2010.
The situation was evidently better in 1950. About 60% of inhabitants aged 20-59 years old and  over 40% of people aged 60-69 years old had ideal weight. There were also some underweight people, mostly among the youth (about 30% people aged 20-29) and the elderly ones (about 60% of respondents aged 60-69). There numbers of overweight people were only ruughly 20% for those aged 30-49 and less then 10% for respondents which were 50-69 year old. Only less than 10% of people aged 40-69 were obese.
In 2010, the situation changed. Obesity has become a common disease. The category of respondents aged 20-29 has less than 5% of obese people, but the more is the age of respondents, the more is the number of obese people among them - it is 10% for 30-39 year old group, more than 25% for 40-49 year old group, about a half for 50-59 year old group and 60% for the group of those aged 60-69, which is 12 times more than in 1950. There are also some overweight people (about 5% in groups 20-29 and 50-59 years old, roughly 40% of people aged 30-49 and less than 25% of those aged 60-69). The numbets of underweight people decreased. There are 20% underweight people among the youth (20-29) years old, less than 5% among the middle-aged people (30-59) and about 10% of the elderly people (60-69). As for ideal weight, the most healthy group is the young people, which contains 70% of respondents with ideal weight and so do about half of the respondents aged 30-59. However, only 5% of people aged 60-69 have ideal weight, which is five times less than in 1950. A probable explanation for these changes could be the appearance of fast-food, which has become extremely popular, although everybody knows it is unhealthy and leads to obesity.
