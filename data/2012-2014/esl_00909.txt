This table represents us demographical situation in Australia. According to the statistics most of the women had more than one child which implies probable growth of the population and in this case birth rate should overweight death rate. But unfortunately the table shows us constant increase of the amount of women having no children at all or only one child while the number of women who had two or three children kept decreasing. The fact that women who took part in a survey were olden than 40 years intends that they had not had more children so this could be an alarm for the government to take steps that would lead to the rise of birth rate. On the other hand, the rapid changes between the years 1986 and 1996 in the amount of children women had could be the result of instable political and economical situation in the country and by the year 2006 population may had not recovered from it.
