While preparing this home assignment I’ve spent more than two hours watching different TED videos. They all were incredibly interesting and I couldn’t stop my choice on any of them. Despite of this, as I have a deadline I have to make a choice rapidly. We waste so many time on decisions… Ok. Let’s not get distracted.
I want to tell you about a small talk called “Looks aren't everything. Believe me, I'm a model”, which impressed me strongly. Firstly, a beautiful woman came to the stage wearing a short dress and high heels. She introduced herself saying that her name is Cameron Russell and she has worked as a model for last ten years. Then she noticed that there is an uncomfortable tension in the audience and changed her outfit in several seconds right on the stage and marked that she was quiet privileged in changing what  people think of her in 10 seconds. By the way, Cameron was absolutely right in this point as the change was really noticeable. In other words, her previous outfit made it hard to take her seriously. To sum up, she said that to be a model is not something that labels a person, a model is just a job, photos of the models do not have anything similar to a real person under the image created by “hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production”. 
What she is trying to tell to us about is quite simple and not new at all as children are always brought up with the thought that nobody should be judged by their appearance. However, this point is often understood in a different way: if a person is not pretty enough or have different imperfections, it does not mean that this person is not interesting to talk with. Cameron Russell tells us about the other side of this principle: even a person with the ideal exterior should not be labelled in any way.
