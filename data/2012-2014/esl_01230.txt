In our country school starts when you are six or seven; there are countries where one should study since his four years, and countries where school starts at your seven or even eight years. When you are small, every year matters, so what can be the reasons for such diversity?
On the one hand, human brain, unlike animal brain, is not yet ready when a child is born, and continues to develop several years after. During this stage the brain is most flexible and can acquire almost everything. Children who learn at very early stages can reach higher results, because many complicated concepts will seem natural for them. It is also good that children are always in a decent place and not hanging out with a company of young drunkards, as this is what every parent is afraid of.
On the other hand, school in many countries is a synonym to boredom and uselessness. It is also often that turn out to be inaccurate or completely wrong when you start you professional studies. Therefore a child left in school for his early years is left without the blissful ignorance of childhood, maybe with some wrong concepts in his head and most importantly without the ability to look at usual things in an unusual way.
All in all, I might say that early fundamental education is good when it is good, when you do not get bored and learn only the things you are interested in (and this, of course, depends on your teacher). I think every option has its advantages and disadvantages; the choice should be done in every family, and it should be thought over well.
