                                                          HOMEWORK.
1)	 No sooner had I woken up than I fell asleep again.
2)	Scarcely had I come home when I remembered about buying bread.
3)	Barely had I looked for it when I lost it.
4)	Hardly had I read this book when the light turned off.
5)	I had no sooner stood up than I sat down again.
6)	Scarcely had the sun shined when storm-clouds gathered.
7)	Hardly had I gone out when the rain started.
8)	Barely had they opened the window when the wind closed it.
