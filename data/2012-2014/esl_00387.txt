Recently I have learned that there is such a beautiful building as Waldspirale. It has become one of my favorite buildings because of its imposing size, beautiful ornament like a gilded onion domes and unusual and in some way strange colouring. A lot of people think that it is ugly and unimpressive. Honestly, my first impression was exactly the same when I just glanced at it. However, it seemed not as bad as I had thought.  After the careful observation I understood that Waldspirale is so unusual that you first have to get used to it. Moreover, when I started to look at some details, I realized how many works and efforts had been enclosed in construction of such house. It really looks like a magic palace or castle. When I see it, I feel that I'm in a fairy tale. It also has very contrast view in a way it looks magnificent and unconventional against the background of the modern well-developed city.   However, photos of apartments in it have raised uncertain feelings in me. Ceiling, walls and floor are too colourful, bright, and the contrast, too striking. 
The whole building is far from looking ancient and traditional, it was built in contemporary and more unusual style. This house impressed me more by its bright, colourful and in some way children's view. I'd like very much to see it with my eyes. It is like a dream of every girl to be in magic castle.
