A summary of points given in the text on pp. 44-45

Usually talking about the endangered species people mean big animals like tigers and whales. However, we must not forget about seemingly unnoticeable species, whose extinction could, however, influence deeply the whole eco-system. The importance of such species could be compared with the role of a keystone in the arched doorway: remove it, and the whole building collapses. That was the reason for a zoologist Robert Paine to name them "keystone species". An experiment with a starfish Pisaster ochraceous held by Paine, a study of sea otters conducted by David Gomn and the example of the dodo clearly demonstrate the action of this mechanism. So, even though scientists may argue over some particular points, now everybody realizes the necessity of identifying and preservation of keystone species.
