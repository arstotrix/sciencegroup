It can be easily said that we live in the era of cardinal reconsidering of people’s priorities. Things that were important for our grandparents are now losing their significance; vice versa, things we are really worried about may have absolutely no special meaning for people of older age. Undoubtedly, such processes lead to certain controvercy around some of those priority issues. One of them is about the importance of salary in comparison with the ‘enjoyability’ of a job. So, what is more important – good salary or interesting job?
Some people will argue that salary is what matters most of all. The idiom‘love in a cottage’ is now getting outdated and starts bearing some sort of ironic connotation. In fact, money rule the world; he who has enough money may allow literally everything he wants. Some of us believe that even the most abhorrent job in the world can be acceptable if it is paid highly enough. They suppose that the money can recover the inescapable despair one can be driven to by such kind of a job.
In my opinion, things are a little bit more complicated. All the money cannot be earned anyway; so why do we have to sacrisifice our lives for the sake of earning more than we can spend? To my mind, the happiness of having a tightly stuffed wallet cannot offset the time spent on a hateful job. As a person who seems to have already got their ‘cutie mark’, I can bet that no other feeling can be compared with the one you have when doing something you really love.
To sum it up, I would like to stress that high salary and interesting job are, in fact, not mutually exclusive. Moreover, to my mind, one can earn a lot of money only if they really adore what they do. The fact is that we only live once, so the main thing about it is not to waste it on something, after all, useless.
