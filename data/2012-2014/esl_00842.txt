The table represents how different the number of student enrolments at Bristol University was in 1928, 1958 and 2008. The information is divided into several groups. It means that the percentage of female, male enrolled students, students from within 30 miles of Bristol and those who came from overseas can be compared.
First, it is to mention that the amount of enrolled students has been increased. In 1928 218 students were accepted, in 1958 – 1,046 students and in 2008 – 6,377. The percentage of female students was different in those years, namely: 42% of girls were enrolled in 1928, in 1958 there were less female students (32%) and in 2008 the percentage of enrolled females grew until 54% which is more than a half of all students. The situation with male students is opposite: the most males were enrolled in 1958 (68%). 
In 1928 there were 50% students came from within 30 miles of Bristol and only 5% from other countries. In 1958 there were 14% students from the first group and 6% from abroad (from 27 countries). And in 2008 the number of enrolled students came from overseas was 28% in comparison to 1-2% of those who came basically from Bristol’s area.
