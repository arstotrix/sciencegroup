The bar charts below show the share of Newtown inhabitants of different weight categories in 1950 and 2010.
We can see with the weight assessment of the Newtown inhabitants considerably changed during the sixty-year period. The diagrams show that the share of people who has an ideal weight dramatically decreased; at the same time, the number of ones who had weight problems became more noticeable.
A more detailed look reveals that the number of those who suffer from overweight and obesity increased in all the age groups: in 1950 more than 50 percent of respondents in all groups experienced any weight deviations; for example, in the 50s there were no obese respondents between 20 and 29, while in 2010 the percentage of suffering from any kind of overweight increased to almost ten percent.
However, the number of the underweight became less considerable in all the age groups. In 2010, the percentage of the ones who lacks weight is extremely low in three age groups: only two or three percent of the respondents aged between 30 and 50 have the weight lower than ideal.
