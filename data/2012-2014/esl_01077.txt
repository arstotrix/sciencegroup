Today my daughter and I went to the theater, Angela liked best costumes.
When I'm on stage I live in a different world. There are dragons and wizards, and brave knights are ready to fight to the death by the hand and heart of a beautiful princess in that world.
In "Glass Heart" heroes differ strange slowness of speech, uncoordinated movements, glances over the camera. Director Werner Herzog wanted to show that the entire population of the city was like in a dream, so almost all the actors during filming were mesmerized.
When I went to school in a literature class we read the famous playwright Ostrovsky's play "Thunderstorm". It made a lasting impression on me.
Sometimes in the theater it is very funny for me to watch how the conductor wave his stick and his hands.
I admire people who have ventured into the scriptwriter profession. The success of the whole film often depends on them and their ideas.
Angelina Jolie knows how to get used to the role wonderful. I am convinced of this watching the film "Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"
Some girls are somewhat cute as best, not a raving beauty.
The hall froze for a moment but after a few minutes the audience burst and the artist got a standing applause.
He was able to bomb among the any public.
