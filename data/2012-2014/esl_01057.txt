I haven't red none of those books, so I had a sort of advantage. But no one of those rewiews really impressed me. I didn't find the rewiew on "To Kill a Mocking Bird" because it spoils not a plot in common, but really important points of it, like "Atticus demonstrates that Tom isn't viliant, but the other character is". So I alredy know that Tom will be acquited but it seems to me like one of the biggest twist of a plot and now everyting is ruined, plot is spoiled and reading wan't be so fascinating like it could be before. So this rewiew is more like a brief summary for those who didn't read the book but need to read it before a literature test: there is all the important points, there is all the proble problems, take it and write your test.
