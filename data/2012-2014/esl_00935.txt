The table shows the number of children born to Australian women within the age range from 40–44 years for four different years: 1981, 1986, 1996 and 2001.

According to the information, in 1981 Australian mothers aged 40-44 years were only slightly more likely to have had two children than three, four or more children. However, by 1986, women of this age were significantly more likely to have given birth to two children than three children or four or more children. It is obvious to say that in 1996 and 2006 the proportions of women aged 40-44 years who had had two children were approximately similar, although for the proportions who had given birth to three children or to four or more children we can regard the downward trend. In other words, in more recent years, Australian women were more likely to have had two children than three or more children and this trend was most marked probably only in the most recent period. Despite the fact that the number of families with two children predominates, the number of women who had given birth to only one child had the upward trend which we can see in progressive increase in proportions that are given, from 7.6% in 1981 to 13.2% in 2006.  For example, in 1981, 8.5% of women aged in their forties were childless and 7.6% had given birth to only one child. By 2006, 15.9% of women were childless and 13.2% had given birth to only one child.

  To sum up, the evident trend was shown by the presented table that the number of women who preferred not to give birth at all or to have only one or two children has increased since 1981, while on the contrary the rate of women aged 40-44 years who decided to have more than two kids has fallen substantially.
