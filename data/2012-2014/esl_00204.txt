A couple of centuries ago with moving on from the economy relying on agriculture to the economy relying on machinery manufacture humanity alsochose what was convenient for them over what was more natural and harmless to the ecology. Then the process of total industrialization in allspheres of human activity came, and the battle between clear air and water and cars and factories resulted in the victory of the last.As we can see, the amount of waste produced by industries in the UK is constantly increasing. And in 2010 the amount of industrial waste reachedits peak. However, we can also notice that the same thing happens with people's concern about the state factories and manufactures have put ourworld's ecology in. And, what is quite a remarkable situation, people's complaints, as it is shown in the charts, can really influence thesituation in the world - with the increasing number of complaints the amount of money spent on waste disposal goes up. It is hard to say if thesituation is that positive and optimistic in other countries, but the UK statistics give us a perfect example showing that an idealistic model'something bad happens - people shout about it, write official complaints or petitions - the government do what they have to do to solve theproblem' can really work out in the modern world. We all just need to remind ourselves (even if we are sure that our opinion cannot change anything now) that the only useless opinion is theunspoken one.
