This work on the sociolinguistic matters represents a problem of the minority languages' situation in Russia. There are people born and grown, for example, in Neftekamsk, so the native language of their older relatives is Tatar. However, what is meaningful for sociolinguistics, these young people were born when Russian was included into syllabi and Tatar became one of the minority languages. It is a common situation: Russian replaces the native language of the country near Russia, like Ukraine. Thus, teenagers and children could learn both languages and only Russian, depending on the level of "invasion". These varied possibilities create a prominent field for research. Studies on this problem are valuable in the sense of maintaining the existence of such languages, discovering the ways to retain them and culture and knowledge they comprise. 
In this research, the goal was to ascertain the attitude of respondents and their families to their two languages: Russian and the native one. It was necessary to find people with that specific "language history", and HSE students were our source, because many of them came from neighbouring countries. Questions to the students were compiled in order to gather as much information as possible from the respondent. Consequently, the findings do not only answer a question of attitude, but also other questions: for instance, the question of a state of the minority language nowadays.
