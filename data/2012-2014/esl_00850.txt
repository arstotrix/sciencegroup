The table compares the number of students enrolled at Bristol University in three different years: 1928, 1958 and 2008. It also gives information about students’ characteristics such as gender and the origin.
It is clear that the number of enrolled students had reached a peak by 2008 consisting 6377 people. The same, the number of students coming from overseas had the highest percentage of 28 while it was approximately at the same level in 1928 and 1958 consisting 5% and 6%.
A more detailed look at the graph reveals that the number of students who came from within 30 miles of Bristol had seen a dramatic decrease from 50% in 1928 to 1-2% in 2008. The interesting fact that the number of both female and male students fluctuated during whole period, however, the percentage of male was remarkably higher than the women’s one in 1958: the former consisted 68% while the latter – only 32%.
To conclude, several significant changes had happened by 2008: the increasing of female students, the marked rise of students having come from overseas and the huge increase of new students entered Bristol University.
