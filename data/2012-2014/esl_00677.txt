These days economics and globalization has developed hugely and it affected interests and hobbys of modern people. Namely, shopping became hobby rather than domestic task. In my opinion, this trend tend to be treated as absolutely negative.
First of all, it reflects the changes in the psychology of many people. Instead of being a method to get food or needs, it started to be a purpose of money earning. Moreover, many people, especially women, end up being addicted to buy stuff regularly. For instance, shopoholics can spend all their money just to buy a much things as they can. As illness, it cannot be called a positive fenomen.
The other drawback of shopping as a hobby has to do with the financial aspect. While in the previous centuries people spent their finances on the things that they need and avoided spending extra time in shops and markets, in our time they enjoy the time there and, therefore, tend to do shopping more. For example, my mother, who doesn’t like shopping, doesn’t’t buy much and safes her money, while my sister spends huge amount of money having a good time in the shopping centres.
Finally. Shopping as a hobby brings no good for us, although interesting activities usually do. Comparing it to sport or music, it re=ather takes some thing from us than teaches anything. Sports make us fit and healthy, but shopping cause lach of time and money.
Overall, considering all the moval, financial and practical issues, shopping should undoubtedly be treated as s negative trend. What is really important to live a full life is to take part in other activities instead of spending time shopping.
