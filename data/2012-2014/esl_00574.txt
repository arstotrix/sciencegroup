The two charts given in the task show us the percentage of weight assessment of inhabitants of Newton in 2010 compared to Newton in 1950.
In 1950 among people from 20 to 29 years old there was 75% of people with ideal weight and 25% of people being underweight, while in 2010 the same age group has 70% for 'ideal' people, 20% for underweight, 5% for overweight and nearly 3% for the obese respondents. Modern Newtowners in age range 30-39 has less than 1% for underweight people, 55% of 'ideal' persons, but 35% of all participants of the survey suffers from overweight, 10% are obese. Over the period of 1950 there was 60% of balanced figures compared to 20% of underweight and the same for overweight. For 2010 year adults from 40 to 49 the percentage of underweight and obese people slightly grew, now it's 3% and 25% correspondingly, but the level of having an ideal body fall down to 40% but the percentage of overweight people are still the same as for 30-39 people. Unlike, people from 1950 has the same amount of percentage for ideal bodies and overweight as they do for 30-39 age group but the amount of obese people raised for nearly 5% and the number of underweight fall reduced to 5%. Looking for the figures of 50-59 years old respondents we can see that the number of people suffering of obese grew twice as much according to those of 40-49 age range while the amount of overweight fall down to 5%,
