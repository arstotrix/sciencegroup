Every person, living in a society, has to communicate with many people. While some people easily find a common language with anyone, others have difficulty in communicating. But is a capability to establish rapport with others innate, or it needs to be developed?
As for me, every person develops its communication skills gradually. The interlocutors are not always pleasant and we must possess qualities such as patience and diplomacy (that appear in adulthood) in order to be successful in the discussion. 
On the other hand some of the children have an inherent ability to attract the attention of others.
To sum it up, congenital abilities and persistence will make you a good communicator.
