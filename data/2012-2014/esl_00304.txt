Despite the recent developments in russian morphonology the regularities of nomina actionis formation in the Russian language have remained outside the scope of scientific research. In my course paper I focus on the verbs of V conjugation class, subclass 1, groups a and b (e. g. искать) and suffix -ни(е). The aim of the research is to find what semantic and morfolonogical features influence the choice of the suffix -ние. The data for the study was taken from Russian National Corpora and put into a table which contained following information: all verbs from, all possible nomina actionis derivated from these verbs and how many times each of these lexemes was found in the corpora. The study suggests that the suffix -ние is used when there are no derivatives with other suffixes. especially Ø-suffix, which is more productive than other ones.
