The table gives the data on student enrolments at Bristol University in three different years - 1928, 1958 and 2008. The rows of the table cover the information about the number of the students, their gender and wether they came from Bristol surroundings or from overseas.

According to the information in the table, the highest increase in number of enrolled students was between the years 1958 and 2008 - the number grew more than six times. From the year 1928 to 1958 the number grew a little less - five times. 

In 1928 and 1958 there were more male students than female. In 1958 the percentage of female students was the only 32 per cent. In 2008 the part of female students was slightly bigger than a half.

The remarkable feature is the significant decrease in number of students who lived within 30 miles from the city. In 1928 they made a half of all the students, in 1958 - 14 per cent and in 2008 only 1-2 per cent. 

The number of students from overseas who entered Bristol University grew noticeably too. In the XXth century it was not more than 6 per cent, whole in 2008 it was 28 per cent. The number of countries where the students come from grew from 3 to 98.

On the whole, the information in the table is the evidence of the increase of student mobility and the tendecy to get higher education among more and more young people.
