If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologists classes, I would try to teach them to express themselves, their thoughts, feelings and emotions easily and clearly and to get pleasure from writing. I would also make them develop critical mind and their own vision of the world.
If I were to be a teacher I would make my lessons interesting and fascinating, I would combine theory and practice to make the course really efficient and able to attract more students. If I were to give a course of creative writing, I would learn more about this subject to feel confident and to be able to answer all stunents' questions.
