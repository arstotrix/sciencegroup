 The connection between age discrimination and two groups of  factors that influence it has been analyzed in the current paper on the basis of ESS data.   The   core variable of "age discrimination" has been constructed;   it was  used as a dependent variable to check the influence of two groups of independent - personal characteristics (including socio-demographic indexes) and socio-cultural factors (including social context).  Thus, gender, education, income and belonging to a minority group are strongly related to experiencing an ageism. Moreover, such indexes as satisfaction with life, subjective health, trust in other people, and seriousness of the discrimination level in the country  have interconnection with the level of ageism.  Striking differences in the level of experienced discrimination have been also found out in different European countries.
