Interpersonal relationships have traditionally been an object of scientific interest in psychology. The present study concentrates on such categories in interpersonal relationships as "acceptable" and "unacceptable". 
Both categories include three aspects to be explored in this study:
- Cognitive (what a person believes to be acceptable/unacceptable for him or her to think in  relationship);
- Affective (emotional) - what a person believes to be acceptable/unacceptable for him or her to feel in a relationship;
- Behavioral (what a person believes to be acceptable/unacceptable for him or her to do in relationship).
The research aims at investigating male and female stereotypes about "acceptable" and "unacceptable" issues in a relationship. The main hypothesis of this study is the following:
Males and females have differing stereotypes concerning what is acceptable or unacceptable in a relationship.
