Hello, Jim!
Let me tell you about a conversation I had once. It was with my friend Tom, who showed interest in the reason of my depressed look. I explained it with my failed proposal to the girl named Ann a day before. He pointed out that it should have failed since Ann liked clean-shaved men. He suggested that I should cut off my hair and beard and try again. I thanked him for a suggestion but refused, because if she changed her mind after I shaved, the effort would not be worth it. He insisted on trying, meaning that I'm not losing anything when being tidy. I mentioned the possibility of this happening, but showing more interest in writinng her a letter.
That's how it happened!
Regards,
Jack.
