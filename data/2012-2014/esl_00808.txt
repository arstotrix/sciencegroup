Nowadays, our lives are full of modern technology and many of us use many different devices. It has both positive and negative influence on human’s life. Some people find it more negative. Therefore, I will consider these two points and we will see to what extent this is true.
There is a point of view claiming that people are failing to learn, or are forgetting, many basic skills. For reasons it is true. Many of us use modern technology to boost their everyday challenges. In other words, the devices, that we have, simplify our life. Our basic skills may suffer from that prevalence of modern technology, for example many taxi drivers or just drivers use GPS navigators, which designed to simplify the process of finding the right way or even more the shortest way. This fact leads to loss of basic skill of reading the map. This basic life skill isn’t acquiring by taxi or lorry drivers, and if someday there will no GPS navigators, satellites or simply connection to them isn’t good, they will fail at their job. Even basic mathematical skills are being hebetated by a genius invention – calculator. A significant amount of people use this device daily or every time when they want to count up something quickly. 
These examples show that many people use modern technology to simplify their lives, but there are still the great number of drivers who use the time-honored map and still there are mathematicians who can count in head.
