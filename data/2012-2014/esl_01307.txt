It is believed that space exploration connected with the national pride than the international effort.
Progress in the space area started in the 20th century with the opposition of two superpower countries – USSR and USA. So, the space exploration has become their national value and the feather in theirs cap. The development of it was individual and each of these two countries passed this way alone without any cooperation. Even nowadays exchange of achievements in space exploration is few.
Some people think differently and consider that all achievements in this area have become from international cooperation. People learn from the mistakes of other’s and the evolution of the space exploration has gained momentum by 21th century.
Although, that there is some disconnection between countries in space exploration, this area gives great expectations. The further development of it seems possible. As in the modern world there is a huge globalization and international efforts are in all areas: politics, science, ecology and etc. It hasn’t passed by the space development. So, possible changes in that area are increase of connections between countries, of their exchange of innovations and a sharp jump in its development.
In addition, the space exploration seems to be the aspect of national value and pride, in the future it is possible that achievements in it will be the results of cooperation.
