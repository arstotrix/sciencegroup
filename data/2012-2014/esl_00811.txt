The charts provide information about the plant species which are at risk. The first diagram illustrates how many species are endangered all over the world, while the second graph shows the distribution of endangered plants in  different environmental zones. 
Although a considerable number of plants is safe, almost the third of species are under some kind of threat. About a fifth of them are vulnerable and around 10% are in danger or at seriously risk of extinction. In some areas plants are more exposed to danger than in others. The greatest proportion of threatened species is tropical wet forest, where more than a half percent are at risk. The second position of the unfavourable habitats take tropical dry forests – about 12%. In contrast, deserts have the lowest propotion of plants at risk – only 0.5 percent. 
To sum it up, the significant number of plants is under the threat, in some habitats they are more endangered in others less, but they all need instant protection.
