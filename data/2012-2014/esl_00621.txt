With the development of technology and mechanization of manufactures constantly moving forward, ecological problems became one of the most important topics under consideration in modern society. Unsurprisingly, one of these problems we need to draw attention to is extinctions of plants and animal species. The graph shows that the number of extinct species in tropical forests will rise to 50,000 per million in the 2060 decade, as compared with less than 10,000 extinct species in our decade, which is more than troubling. 
What we need to do first to stop this constantly increasing rate of extinctions is to understand what factors influence this bothering situation the most. The chart showing the main threats to plant life may not let us fully understand the whole picture, but it can definitely provide us with the examples of such threats that can be found influencing not only plant, but animal life etc. For instance, this is no surprise that it is human impact that does most of the harm with its 81.3% compared with 18.7% of threats considered as natural events. In my opinion, this relation between human and natural impact on extinction in animal life must be almost identical to what we have in this chart. People always like to blame natural disasters (with only 7% on the chart), but what we need to understand is that for plants agriculture and harvesting are much more harmful. In fact, only agriculture provides the same amount of threads as all of the natural events, with its 18.7% on the chart.
People should understand that if we ruin something it is only for us to make it right again.
