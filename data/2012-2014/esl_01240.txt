The effectiveness of alternative medicine should be tested in the same way as that of the conventional medicine.

During the last decade the popularity of alternative medicine has raised significantly. Not only common people, but also scientists have finally accepted the concept of some other type of treatment existing and working. Still, this sphere remains quite unexplored and one of the most controversial issues is connected with effectiveness of alternative medicine. People tend to believe in something only once it was tested by conventional scientific ways. But can we apply the same methods in case of alternative medicine?
 One the one hand, it would very beneficial for sellers as they would get lots of customers, who will be absolutely sure in what they are buying. Besides, conventional tests could convince all the scientific world that alternative medicine has it’s right to exist. Moreover,  if human’s body is being treated the process of healing is supposed to be the same in terms of physiology, no matter what medicine is used. So, if the patient organism begins to recover it means that alternative medicine is working.
However, from my point of view relying only on conventional tests would be a mistake. First of all, alternative treatment usually takes much more time than drugs due to the fact that it’s more tender. I also suppose that chemical reactions that happen in the patient’s body may differ, depending on the way of treatment. So, scientists can be reject the concept of alternative medicine e once they notice something unfamiliar to them. Finally, so called human factor play a great role as well. If the patient doesn’t trust the new way of treatment, his negative thinking would spoil the tests, as undoubtedly mind can control the rest of the body.
On the whole, I think that the best option would be to combine goof old ways and something new.
