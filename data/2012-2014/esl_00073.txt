THE MEANING AND FACTORS OF JOB BURNOUT
Introductory paragraph
Despite the current variety of approaches to job burnout and considerable differentiation of the factors and conditions contributing to this syndrome, the present research lacks a general systematic conception of its mechanism.
Job burnout is defined as a reaction to chronic occupational stress and characterized by emotional exhaustion, cynicism and lack of professional efficacy. However, the question why in the same organization or profession some people suffer burnout but others do not remains open. 
The purposes of this paper are to examine the construct of job burnout and its determinants, to consider how this construct has evolved, and to provide a conceptual framework integrating the factors of job burnout for all types of occupational groups and corporate settings.
The hypothesis of the paper is that the overall risk of burnout may be explained by a simple relationship between two separate factors found in every job: excessive expectations and perception of the real situation. The discrepancy between the expectations and the perception of reality multiplied by time leads to the development of the syndrome. 
The current study has three innovative features. First, job burnout is considered to be a conflict between unmet expectations and perception of the real situation. Second, the mechanism of burnout and potential types of conflict are examined at three levels, namely personal, social and organizational. Third, work engagement, a concept negatively correlated to burnout, is presented as a virtual way out of the conflict.
An important practical implication of the study is that the model helps to identify the root contradictions and inconsistencies; understanding the nature of the conflict is dramatically important for developing individual solutions to the problem.
Providing empirical evidence on the validity of the model is a major aim for future research.
