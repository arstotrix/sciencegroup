People who take risks are much more likely to be successful.Nowadays there are many recipes for becoming a successful person. Everyone chooses their own way of attaining success and being satisfied withtheir life. Some people suppose that a man should risk at least once in his life if he wants to be prosperous, while others are strong opponentsof any kind of risks.      From my point of view, if a person wants to be successful a man should take his or her chances. First, everyday we meet with varioussituations that imply taking risks. For example, if a person drives a car he risks to be involved in an accident; if a person travels by subway,he takes risks to become a victim of terrorism. However, in spite of danger, people repeat their daily routine, and do not consider its possibleconsequences. Therefore, life itself implies risky style of life. Secondly, if we were always afraid of risks we would never learn how to walk,how to communicate that are inevitable steps to having a  full and happy life.However, there is an opinion that if people risks and fails he or she could lose faith in themselves and even develop complexes that wouldprevent them from achieving a success in the future. I think that taking risks, conversely, helps people to develop their capabilities andpersonal skills. Even losing, a man gets some experience and learns from mistakes and eo ipso comes nearer to the success. That is why takingrisks is not only a necessity, but also utility.      To sum up, I would like to say that there are different opinions about whether to take risks or not, but there is a good proverb:" Nothingrisk, nothing win" that teaches us to be sure in ourselves and take our chances in life.
