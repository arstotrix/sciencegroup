As for me,I prefer to read most of all the book reviewer number two,because the languge of it is very simple and every person,even a child,can easily read it.The author of the review is trying to convey to the reader the main point of the novel.There are no any idioms or a huge and brilliant metaphors.All the worlds are commonly usuable in everyday speech.
The reviewer on a book "To kill moskingbird" is awful to my mind, the author of the rewiewer says to us only his point of view and some retelling of the original text.I misunderstand the review.May be if I have red this book,I would understand the things, which the author of the topic want to say us.
The review on Stewen Pinker  is  very difficult to understand. There are a lot of quotes,which complicate the understanding of the text as a whole.Thera are many worlds,which I do not know.I have to use a vocabulary,when I read it.
