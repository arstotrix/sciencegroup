Some people believe that academic abilities of students should be tested to select pupils according to their academical abilities, whereas others suppose that it would be better to have students with different abilities studying together.

From the one hand, such a devision would give talented students a unique opportunity to make a great progress while learning at school. There are many examples of schools which have selection and strict requirements and it motivates students to do their best. 

From the other hand, if students with different abilities study together, the ones with stronger abilities can motivate others with poorer abilities. For me, it is very important to have a guiding line while studying. If all students have the same level, there is no incentive to develop and some students can become less assidiuous. Moreover, the requirements of teachers can become lower and lower. 

To my mind, the modern educational system is quite appropriate as there are different opportunities to choose the most convenient one. The most of schools admit all the children, while special schools require to pass exams to get into. Such  system gives to students an opportunity to concentrate on the subjects they like mostly and not to study other subjects more than they need. Another option is facultative classes which are conducted in many schools and which are not obligatory for all the students. Such classes help sudents which are interested in particular subjects.

In the conclusion, I would like to say that the ecudational system should give as many opportunities to study anything they want as possible, so the both learning strategies should be available.
