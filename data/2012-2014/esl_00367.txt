Oil and natural gas are produced in the east of Russia. A lot of oilfields are discovered in Siberia and in the Far East. Siberia is also rich in non-ferrous metals, and lead, silver and gold are produced there.
In the last century this region was also rich in wood, but in the Soviet Union times the forests were cut down extensively, and, although this region is still considered to be one of the most woody places in the world, nowadays the Siberian forests need to be maintained, while they are still being felled. 
The ecology of the area was also damaged after several big industrial cities had been founded there. For instance, Norilsk is said to be one of the most polluted cities in Russia. A big amount of harmful substances are released in the air by the factories. This problem must be sorted out as soon as possible, but, unfortunately, nowadays no way out is found. However, the situation is hoped to be changed to the better in the future.
