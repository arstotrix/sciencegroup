When I was a child we used to spend our holidays n the countryside. We would come to our little house on Saturday. We would cook meat and potatoes and always had our supper late in the evening. After supper we would watch TV, but one day my father bought a set of the lawn furniture, and very soon we got  used to spend our evenings in the garden. We would go to bed  midnight. My bed was considered quite uncomfortable, but I was used to  it. 
We would go to the nearby forest  Sunday mornings. We also used to swim in a lake when the weather was fine, but, unfortunately, one day we found  that the lake had just been polluted and decided to do without swimming in it. We would spend the whole day in the open air and leave the house after sunset... Unfortunately, we had to sell our house in 2005.
