In some countries people think that children should start going to school from four years without waiting to become seven years old, as before.
On the one hand this is very pragmatic because children will not waste 3 years of their life before studying.  If kids start to go to school earlier, they will graduate earlier, too. Nowadays, urban flow of life becomes faster, so it’s better for people to start working as soon as they can to become more successful.
On the other hand, this is cruel enough to children: stealing their ‘kindergarten time’ can lead to sociopathy and lack of communication skills, because children will not have these three years to learn how to communicate with each other: when kids go to kindergarten from 4 to 7 years, they learn some important things, which aren’t focused in school studying, if it isn’t special school, such as: drawing, dancing, some other arts and, as the main thing, communicating with other kids. 
Moreover, if children will have to begin formal education from four years, it means that they will end their first higher education in 18 years.  This isn’t good because, for example, in our country, graduates will have to join army for one year too early.
In the conclusion, I think that parents shouldn’t send their children to school so early: ‘kindergarten time’ is very important and it shouldn’t be skipped if parents want to see their children socially adapted and successful enough to make their all dreams come true
