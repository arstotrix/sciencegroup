To start I would like to say that all reviews had their strong and weak points and every of them could be useful for book lovers.
The review I liked the best were those written about the books "To kill a mockingbird" and "Three men in a boat..."
The thing I liked in the review about "To kill a mockingbird" was the fact that it was full of emotions and impessions and original thoughts of the author which were  very interesting to compare with my own and there were a lot of ideas worth to think about so for me this review is really thought-provoking. The only weak point is that in my opinion the plot of the book is not clearly presented in the review althougs thedescription of the characters was really bright and full .That is why I think it was written for people who have already read the book and it's a question if it could attract new readers and make them want to read this book.
The one about "Three men in a boat..." is very laconical and easy to read, the plot of the book is described in general but not spoiled to those who haven't read the book. But as for me the characters are described poorly and the review doesn't express fully the author's opinion. So I can't count on it in deciding if the book is worth reading, and that's one of the most important functions of the book review.
To put all in the nutshell I can say that a good review should contain the summary of the content but not spoil all the plot turnings, there should be a critical opinion and the author's impressions.
