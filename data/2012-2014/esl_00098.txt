The significant size of the LGBT population as the potential recipients of the psychological help calls for both non-discrimination policies and LGBT affirmative counseling practices. Despite this, counseling psychologists are still avoiding work with representatives of the sexual minorities; moreover, the research shows that very few of the recent psychology graduates are trained adequately enough to counsel those who belong to various sexual minorities.
 four-item questionnaire was sent to 14 Canadian universities (taking into account both master and doctoral programs) and, according to its results, we can presuppose, that gay and lesbian psychology is neglected during the counseling graduate students' preparation. It is the issue of high importance that future counseling psychologists know how to work with LGBT people and how to help them. Hence, a comprehensive and flexible curriculum for the counseling psychology trainees is offered in this article. It conforms to the international requirements concerning gay and lesbian counseling practices regarding multiculturalism, diversity and LGBT-affirmativeness.
