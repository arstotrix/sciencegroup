Psychology was one of the first disciplines to study homosexual orientation as a discrete phenomenon, although until early 20th century only pathological models of homosexuality were studied.
In the last 50 years a huge amount of research work was made to show that being gay, lesbian or bisexual is compatible with normal mental health. However there are experiences of discrimination and possible rejection  by society. This social feature is called institutionalized homophobia which is  main factor of the creation of Internalized homophobia.
The main thesis of the work is self-acceptance in homosexuality : complexities and specific particularities of the awakening and acceptance of own homosexual orientation.
The main purpose is to investigate internalized homophobia as the most problematic factor in the process of self-acceptance in homosexuality
