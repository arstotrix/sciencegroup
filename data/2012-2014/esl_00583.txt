These two charts demonstrate the significant distinction between weight assessment of inhabitants of Newtown in 1950 and 2010. As we can see, there were no obese or even overweight respondents among young adults in 1950, and the percentage of people, whose weight can be named as ideal, is about 70%. This number hasn't changed during six decades, from 1950 till 2010, but in 2010 there is an insignificant percentage of obese and overweight people - only 8%. 
However, the situation is not as prosperous as it may seem. The amount of obese people in the age of 30-39 changes dramatically from 0%(1950) to 10%(2010), and the same situation is demonstrated by charts in the groups of other ages. In comparison with 1950, the percentage of people in ideal weight has sharped down, while the number of fat adults, pensioners and old folks has surged. 
The most exponential is figure about people in age 60-69. While in 50-s there were a few of obese - only 4%, in 2010 the percentage of thick old people has reached an awful number of 60%. So, these two charts illustrate some considerable changes, which are to be noticed and seriously considered.
