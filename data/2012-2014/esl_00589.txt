The graph shows the prospective extinctions of plant and animal species in tropical forests estimated up to the beginning of the twenty-second century. And the chart shows the real threats to plant life that are presented nowadays.

The graph gives the information starting in 2000. According to this graph, the extinction of species will be growing  until 2060, when it is estimated to be the highest - 50,000 extinct species per million per decade. The speed of extinction will be getting higher each twenty years, in the first 20 years of the twenty-first century it will icrease twice, in the next 20 years it will get twice higher than the previous, in the following 20 years it will multiply 2,5 times again. After 2060 the extinction speed is to gradually discrease to the mark at 30,000 extinct species per decade.

The chart gives the information about the main threats to the plant life. The most noticable feature is that most of the threats are due to human impact - over than 80 per cent, and slighly lower than 19 per cent of the threats is because of natural events. As for disastrous human impact, the most damage is caused by agriculture - the percentage of this sphere's threats is as high as that of natural threats on the whole. Other people's activities, that are highly-damageble for the plants, are harvesting which is close to agriculture at percentage - 14.4, and development and logging that are around 10 per cent of the threats each. 

To sum up, the information given presents a bad prospective of the extinction and clearly shows that most of the damage to the nature is brought by people. Probably, the increase in the extinction is connected to the increase in human activities and human invasion into the nature.
