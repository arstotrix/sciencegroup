Art has been attracting a lot of people for ages. Some of them were able to make money from it, others were not. There is an opinion that it is unfair that nowadays some artists receive huge sums of money for their works of art while others struggle to survive. Should governments do something to resolve this situation? I do not think so.
Firstly, to my mind, art should not be only a race for money. If money is the main worry of artists they do not have time for creating real masterpieces. Nowadays we see a lot of artists, who work for commercial companies and make design, advertisement and photography, but they make selling product from art and only few of them become really successful. 
Another thing is that some of great artists, whose pictures are the best examples of art, had no money during their lives. It was, for instance, Vincent van Gogh or Jan Vermeer. They worked for art, not for money or success. 
Finally, art is not a socially significant thing like education or health care, it is culture significant. This is the reason why governments pay less attention to it. At the same time modern art is a competition. Some people ‘win’ and earn lots of money, others do not.
In my opinion, we have no reason and no clear way to make area of art fairer because there aren’t well-defined attributes and products of art, it is not a thing that can be paid fairly.
