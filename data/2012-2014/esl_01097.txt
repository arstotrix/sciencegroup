If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologists classes, I would try to explain to them how it is interesting to write articles and texts about everything. Students have to understand how it is interesting to explore theme of their writing. I would give them themes about historical places from novels and would go with them to that places. We would explore places and connect our information of it with novels. I think it is very useful and interesting.
