The diagram shows chandes in types of accomodation that students have been choosing to live in while studing for the last fifty years. 
Overall, students tended to became more and more independent from their families and even host families through the decades. There was a stable growth in a number of students choosing a room in a house or a flat to share with other students from 1960s to 2000s. 
A more detailed look shows that living at their own familyâ€™s home, that was the least popular at 1960s, was becoming more and more unpopular through the next three decades, but in 2000s figure rose more than twice. 
Number of students living in a students hall of residence did not have any clear tendency of increasing or decreasing. It has never been very popular but reached its maximum in 1970s and 1990s. 
The last two types of accommodation showed stable tendencies in their evolution. The number of students living in shared flat or house was increasing for the whole period and by 2000s it had risen twice.  Students who paid for living with a host family reduced in their number more than six times.
To sum up, a huge difference in popularity between host families and renting a flat or a house, that were equal at the beginning, had appeared by the end of a period. The other types of accommodation do not show great changes.
