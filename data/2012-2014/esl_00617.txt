These plots show us development of the extinction of the environment and the reasons for this.
As can be seen from the first graph, the number of endangered plants and animals is growing rapidly until 2060, after this scale decreases. It can be assumed that about 2060 happens something what can solve the problem. Until humanity can't solves this problem. While we have no idea how it could be decided.
The second graph shows the cause of this catastrophe. More than three-quarters takes human intervention is allowed, or only one quarter of the natural events. Of course,  human brings great damage to the nature. The largest part of the human intervention is agriculture. On the second place there are harvesting, development , logging .  Even a smaller part by the livestock ,disturbance, invasive species, plantations.
It would be great  if forecasts were true and by 2060 mankind was able to solve the global problem.
