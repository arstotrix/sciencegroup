In the present age of modernly developing technologies, the question about the exploration of space is 

truly a burning issue. The governments of countries all over the world unite in order to reach the depths 

of outer space. However, some argue that space exploration is not about international companionship, 

but more about each nation's own pride.

To my mind, space exploration cannot be considered only a matter of one nation's pride. The dark 

mysterious depths of outer space can hide the answers to the questions which may have something to 

do with the future of the entire humanity. In other words, this particular issue must be handled on a 

scale much larger than a single nation, on the scale of the whole mankind. If all the countries unite their 

resources in order to explore space, it may draw the world closer to the futuristic cosmological utopia 

described so many times by all kinds of science fiction authors. Like in a novelette by Poul Anderson, one 

day we may even find another planet inhabited by conscious creatures, who may be just like us, 

exchange our knowledge and let our progress make a significant leap. But of course this is impossible 

unless the whole humanity unites its power.

It cannot be denied that in order to live in such kind of utopia in the distant future, the approach to 

space exploration needs to be completely changed as soon as possible. I suppose that over the next ten 

years the governments of the highly developed countries will stop spending money on making war with 

each other and start developing a common space program.

To sum it up, I would like to stress that space exploration is becoming a significant part of the whole 

mankindâ€™s life. This is why it is crucial to change our attitude towards it. Personally, I believe that one 

day the exploration of space will lead the humanity to what is often called utopia.
