The diagrams demonstrate the amount of waste that UK industries produce during the four-year period, the annual size of investment in wastedisposal and the level of public dissatisfaction. It's obvious that two first scales have to be jointly considered as the size of investmentdirectly depends on the amount of waste produced. The third graphic might be regarded as an indicator of the success that waste disposal programattained. First diagram shows the substantial jump of the amount of waste in the year 2010. However, every surge is always accompanied by thelowering of the amount of waste in the next year. The second diagram reflects the gradual increase of the amount of money invested in wastedisposal program. In the year 2008 the investment was relatively low and totaled only one million euros, but by the year 2011 the size of theinvestment reached a peak and already counted 2.5 million euros. Surprisingly, the third scale does not illustrate the successfulness of thewaste disposal program but the general public concern about the environmental issues in UK as the level of complaints progressively risesthrough the four year under research.
