The success of a company depends on the happiness of its employees.
The aim of all commercial companies is to get as much money as possible. And there is no doubt that they will try all possible ways to make this aim real. Some psychologists claim that the success of a company is connected with the level of happiness of people, working in it. So, what are pros and contra for this statement?
On the first view, that seems to be to be a true fact. People who consider themselves happy have more chances to overcome working difficulties and sort out business problems. They have more enthusiasm and while they communicate with others, they share with them good mood and positive attitude to everything. Secondly, it is not a secret that people do something well if they like it. If the employees are in love with their work, they definitely will do it in a best way, making company more successful.
But on the other hand, there are different opinions about this issue. For example, another great way to motivate people work hard is money. They can do not like their wok, do not be satisfied with the atmosphere and colleagues but they won’t change it because of a high salary. Moreover, they can be unhappy because of private reasons (problems with health, bad relationships with family or friends, etc.) and that is why they will work hard (making company more and more successful) trying to focus all their attention on their job and forget about the problems
To sum up, it mostly depends on the concrete company and its employees. In some ways that statement is true, in some – false. But practically I agree that if people working in company are happy, the company has more chances to be successful.
