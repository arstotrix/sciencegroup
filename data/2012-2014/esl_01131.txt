“Good communicators are born, not made”
There exists a point of view that to communicate well with other people a person should be born with special skills and features. I doubt it, in my opinion it is possible to train social skills by sensible and careful parenting.  First, communicating is not something that can be predisposed genetically. A great variety of psychological books are written about how to bring up a socialized person, in other words, a good communicator.  Secondly, there exists the art of good communicating with its special principles and details. Otherwise, why there is so many psychological programs that are aimed to make people more cooperative and sociable or better storytellers?
