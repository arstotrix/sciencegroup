What makes me unique?
Nowadays, there are 7 billion people on our planet.  And each one doesn't like others. We all have different qualities that make us unique, so we are all unusual. We can differ from others in our views, because of our individual appearance, even twins who were born similar to each other have special interests.
 Now as for me
I was born in Pyatigorsk. I have been living there for 14 years. There I studied at the Lyceum and also attended Music school, where I learned to play the guitar. Playing the guitar became my hobby and after finishing the Music school I started to study on my own. I also taught to play the guitar my friends who didn't want to study at the Music school, so I taught them the basics of the playing the guitar.
In addition to this, I went in for sports. I have been swimming for 8 years, trained every day and performed in the competitions, so I have a lot of awards and cups. I have a grade of swimming. And I also fond of other sports such as football, volleyball and basketball. Extremely sports take part in my hobbies too. I enjoy snowboarding.
 I just moved from Northern Caucasus to   Moscow 3 years ago. After the school I prefer to study at the HSE. But it's all the fun has just begun!
