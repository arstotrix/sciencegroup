The diagram contains some data on the frequency of visiting different places for leisure activities among  3 different groups of Australian people.
First of all, cinema is the most popular place for both kinds of people born in English-speaking countries and almost the second popular place among other people. Probably, it happens because this kind of entertainment is both the cheapest and the most convenient way of spending time for common people.
However, there is surprisingly high level of library visitors among people, whose mother language is not English. Possibly, it can be explained by the fact that this group of people needs  further immersion into  written English.
Theatre is the most unpopular place for all groups of people. I suppose, the reason for it is the fact that theatres are mainly visited by intelligence, not by common people, so, this result is quite predictable.
