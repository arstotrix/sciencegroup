It is generally accepted that using only positive information on pre-hired outcomes attracts the applicants. At the same time there may be situations, where realistic information can increase the attractiveness of organization (Research on persuasion; Hass, 1982). So, this paper examine the effects of using the realistic information (information that is negative but yet is common to many jobs) in the recruitment message. Researches hypothesize that  realistic recruitment message, under certain circumstances,  lead to higher organizational attractiveness than the positive only . The hypothesis is tested by the analyze of of students reports: they evaluated one of two recruitment messages (positive and realistic) and described their perception of organizational attractiveness. The analysis demonstrated that realistic recruitment message lead to higher organizational attractiveness through perception of challenge in the work. The study may be interesting for organizations that are afraid to include negative information in the recruitment message when trying to initially attract applicants.
