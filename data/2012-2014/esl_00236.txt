Some people think that it is more important that cities provide cheap houses and facilities, while others suppose that it is worth spending money on well-designed buildings that look beautiful. In fact, this is rather an idealistic opposition, because there are few cities that are  raised from nothing.
There can be constructed good-looking houses that do not cost huge sums of money. Of course, the main part of a building's cost is made up of for the cost of the land and materials. Saving on materials is not fair regarding future house-holders, but sometimes it could be a good solution. Construction in the country or in small towns, where it is not so essential to pack as much people as possible in a very small part of Earth's surface, clay can be used as the main material. It is common case in African countries, but now the popularity of this in Europe is growing among eco-minded people, also because it is environment-friendly and does not require any special skills. Clay houses are constructed from local material, they are functional and designed in a modern way and provide healthy microclimate. They cost only one third of a corresponding cement house. There is an important disadvantage of this kind of construction - clay houses are not suitable for some climates and they allow limited heights and space.
May be, architects should be looking for new materials to construct useful and good-looking houses.
