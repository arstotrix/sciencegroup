Nowadays mass media (television in particular) appears to be really focused on different kinds of sport. It may look like a good thing, but some people claim that this just dims the enthusiasm of young people and discourages them from participating in sport.
In my opinion, nothing is wrong with having lots of TV-programs dedicated to sport. They are great for entertainment, and they unite people with similar interests. But most importantly, they are truly inspiring. When you see these beautiful, incredibly fit people fighting for victory you just want to turn your TV-set off and go jogging, play basketball or volleyball or whatever you prefer. I think lots of people have joined some sport club following in their favorite sportsmen’s footsteps. After watching several skating championships one of my own friends started skating a lot. I myself am fond of athletics and gymnastics and now I am considering joining some kind of sport club connected with one or the other.
But on the other hand, there are those who think exactly the opposite. Such people find watching TV-shows about sport discouraging for youths. Firstly, they probably think that young people tend to just sit and watch instead of actually doing something. Why bother getting of the couch, when there are professionals out there who can do all the jumping and running and things like that? Secondly, young people may think that they are never going to be as good at sport as professionals, so they just do not attempt anything. I can see why such opinion exists but I do not agree with it at all. 
So, to conclude, I would like to say that it is really important to have lots of TV-shows about sport. People are motivated to take up sports or at least to improve their lifestyle, becoming more fit and healthy. I hope that in the future sport programs will be broadcast as often as they are right now.
