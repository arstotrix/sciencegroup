The graph and chart give us inside in the ecological situation, that is connected to the plant and animal life. They display prognosis of extinction for the next hundred years and threats to plant life, that could explain the dependence between these two.
The graph shows that up to the year 2060 the extinction level grows constantly, reaching 50,000 extinctions per million species per decade. After this period the number of species becoming extinct falls gradually and is about 30.000 in 2100.
According to the chart, the main reason of the plant extinction is human impact on the nature, being four times as high as the damage caused by natural events. The percentage of its threats is about 40%.
The threats coming from humans could explain the reason, why the extinction growth stops in 2060. All the natural resources used by people (like forest, animals, water etc.) might be over due to this decade. That is the reason why later people stop using them so active as before.
To sum up, these both illustrations show us, that the level of extinction of plant and animal species is connected to the human activities related to them.
