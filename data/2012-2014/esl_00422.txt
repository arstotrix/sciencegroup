The syntax of complex sentences with complement clause is not studied thoroughly. One of the most problematic topics in this area, the cases of usage of correlative pronoun "to" in the main clause of Russian complex sentences, needs to be improved. In her paper, Kobozeva I. (Kobozeva 2011) studies the conditions of this pronoun usage in the complement clauses introduced by "훾hto". But the conditions in which it is possible, optional or necessary to use "to" before such complement clauses introduced with "훾htoby" has not been studied, although this is one of confusing parts for learners of Russian language, because there is no rule when "to" can be used in such constructions.  
The aim of the current study is to define conditions of usage of the correlative pronoun "to" before "훾htoby" in the complement clause of the complex sentences. This paper focuses on syntactic structure, semantic characteristics of the complement clause in such sentences with correlative pronoun and without it, finally results by this sentences are compared and come to a range of distinct conditions of usage of "to, 훾htoby" in complex sentences.
