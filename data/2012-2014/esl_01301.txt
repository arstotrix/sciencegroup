Maybe I just don't understand clearly what book review is, or it is not my genre, but I like neither of these two reviews. There is nothing new, nothing interesting there. All what this two authors said seems to me evident.
I like to read articles about books, but only if I can find there something, what I couldn’t understand or invent by myself, that’s why I didn’t like these notes.
So, there is another type of writing about books, which I can comprehend, it is an item about new book, which helps readers to decide whether they want to read a book. But the both review don’t make me and my classmate want to read it, and the review on Harper Lee’s  book even retells the plot, which, on my opinion, can spoil reading.
Netherless, I really like how the reviews written, especially the second one. It almost continues the book, it has the same voice and it enchants me.
