Nowadays blogs become more and more popular, we can  see their number explode and as for me they are a real phenimenon of the modern society. But why are they so extremely popular?
First of all, blogs owe their popularity to the universal spread of the Internet. In fact modern people can't live without the Internet and they pass most of the lifetime online surfing, watching videos, chatting, reading blogs or blogging.
The second reason is the enormous diversity of subjects that blogs are devoted to. It means that blogs are made for completely different categories of people, there are blogs about sports, fashion, cooking, travelling or science and that's why everybody can find ones interesting for him or her.
However not every blog can succeed. But what does it need to attract followers?
I don't usually read blogs, but I have an example of two blogs, the first one which I liked and probably would visit more than once and the second one which I found not very interesting.
The first blog author's name is Marianna, she's from Finland but write in English that attracts readers from all over the world. Marianna writes about fashion, her posts are really interesting, emotional and with humour, there are also lots of good photos and she gives really good advices and answers followers' questions.
The blog which disappointed me is written in Russian by a young girl and for me it isn't interesting at all because its main subject is this girl herself, posts are written with a lot of mistakes, there aren't many good photos and there's no real feedback. That is why this blog is not very popular among internet users.
So to become popular blog should be clearly and emotionally written, acessible for people from different countries, should contain beautiful photos and interesting and useful information.
