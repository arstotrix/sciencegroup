This book is a diary of Anne Frank, thirteen year old girl. It tells us about the events in her life,  feelings during the Second World War.
It begins in 1942 in Holland. On her birthday, Anne received a lot of gifts. Diary liked her the most. Anne was a cheerful and sociable girl, but she did not have a best friend, so her new diary became him. Anne gave a name to it â€“ Kitty. The girl not only wrote her thoughts, she was in communication with imaginary friend.
Anne was born in a Jewish family. Jews were despised. They were forced to wear special clothing with the distinctive emblem, buy food in specialized stores and their children went to the school for the Jews. Much was disabled for this nationality. Anne's family was forced to hide in the shelter with the family van Daan. They were very afraid of each other, often misused. Anne felt that no one understood her, but always believed in the best, in the victory over the Nazis. 
Despite all obstacles and hardships, Anne sincerely believed in God. She did not complain about her fate, thought that her family lived well (they could buy some clothes). The girl also worried about her friends. 
It was so interesting to read the moment, where Anne wrote about her feelings for Peter. Despite the complexity of fate, Anne was a girl who dreamt of love. I really liked how pathetic she described her friendship with the son of van Daan, their first kiss, her emotions.
This is an amazing story! Anne's bravery and perseverance delight. Unfortunately, the girl did not live up to the liberation of Holland, but in this diary we can learn about all her thoughts and feelings.
