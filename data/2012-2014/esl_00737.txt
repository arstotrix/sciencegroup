WB. p11 ex.1 Graph

The graph provides information about school leavers between 2008 and 2012. It indicates how many puplis have chosen one of the three opportunities: going to university, take a so called "gap year" or directly after school go to work. 
According to the diagram the large quantity of school leavers in 2008 prefers looking for a job. However, the rate of this feature was reducing over time. The incidence of teenagers, that have chosen to go to university after school, was increasing from 2008 till 2010, but then this tendency was going to fall. In 2008 the majority of pupils went to look for a work, while the number of the school leavers, who have chosen a temporal break, was three time lower. However, gradually the trend to take a gap year was increasing rapidly and by 2012 over 300 teenagers have chosen this variant.
In summary, the graph illustrates the strong tendency, which probably is an interesting indicator of changes in social life of young people. It's become common to take a break from education, while only five years later was still prior to work or study.
