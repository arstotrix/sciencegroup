If I hadn't entered university and had decided to have a rest from studing this year, I would have slept a lot and I wouldn't be writing this essey right now. Maybe I would have gone to France for several months and would speak French as fluently as the French do. I also would have been doing sports like dancing and archery. Moreover, maybe I would have become a good musician or a writer. I also would have read all sorts of books I like and would have come to know myself better. On the other hand, if I hadn't studied linguistics this year, I wouldn't have known how intersting it is, how wonderful, smart, and funny linguists are. Also I wouldn't have met some amazingly interesting people.
