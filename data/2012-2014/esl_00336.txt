Man has been trying to make his life easier for many centuries. And he has invented a lot of appliances for his life which pollute our planet.
Economists have thought that the atmosphere, forests, rivers and seas are capable of absorbing all the rubbish the economy throws into them. There are so many pollutions because of it. One scientist said that we have been killing out planet by ourselves. Man has changed the Earth: he has polluted everything and now we have water and air pollutions, acid rains which destroys forests, etc. Greenhouse effect has become more and more dangerous and our climate changes. Many diseases are caused by reduction of ozone layer.
One of the other problems is that animals are becoming extinct. Pollution has been threatening their lives during the last time.  Several environmental groups have been working to prevent their extinction since this problem has appeared. Many animals find it more and more difficult to survive as their natural habitat has been destroyed for the last period.
In conclusion, I want to say that we must think what we have done with our world now or very soon we will have no world to live in.
