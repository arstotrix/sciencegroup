Sorry I haven’t written, I’ve been incredibly busy, but  I have good news! I have decided on the title: «The Madwoman in the Attic». What do you think about it? Now the ghost is not on the top floor but in the attic. The hero hears footsteps above him .He goes to the attic and sees a young girl. I don’t know exactly what happens next, but I ‘m sure that I’ll tell you in my next blog.
 I’ve already finished Chapter 5.The hero’s Name is Peter Youngblood. He is an architect so he understands how houses are built. He needs someone who knows about the ghosts. Maybe it could be the person who sold the house? Is it too easy? What do you think?
The publishers are happy with Chapter 1 and too. Deadline now is in February so I’m now a lot happier.
