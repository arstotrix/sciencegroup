The city look is something that we have to see every day. Most of the time we see ordinary simple grey houses that look like each other; that  isespecially true for outskirts. In the downtown the situation is usually better and the buildings' looks are more diverse. People  have  differentopinions on what city houses should be like.Lots of people consider most of the buildings boring and monotonous. They claim that new  buildings  built  should  be  brighter  and  less  likeordinary multistoried houses we can see on the outskirts. So, the architects can try to design modern buildings which  will  fit  into  the  citypanorama. Sometimes they succeed in it like in the case of the famous 30 St Mary Axe  in  London  which  is  often  called  the  "Gherkin".  Thisskyscraper, in spite of its modern appearance, successfully fits into old town scenery. Sometimes, however, the architects  fail  in  combinationmodern buildings with the surroundings. The example for this case, in my opinion, is Moscow-City complex which for me looks like an  eyesore  anddoesn't correspond to the scenery.Other people, however, prefer the comfort to the beauty and, thus, consider that architects and engineers would better  care  about  conveniencesand safety than the looks. Sometimes their opinion is proved by some accidents. For example, already mentioned Moscow-City was on  fire  about  ayear ago; the cause of the fire was probably inefficiency of builders. That event proves that planners of buildings should not run to extremes.As I think, the best solution of the dilemma between comfort and beauty is combining both. It is evident that there is no  better  house  than  abeautiful and comfortable one and designers should work hard to reach this goal.
