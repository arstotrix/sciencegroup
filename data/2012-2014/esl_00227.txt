Nowadays people argue about the spirit of sporting competition whether it has been destroyed or not. Sport becomes rather business and not the fair play.
Nobody will deny if I say that there is a huge amount of money moving in sport. So it is a common view that sport is no longer sport but only money. Sportsmen are motivated by means of their salary that is what some people now think about sport. It is a fact that there are contract matches, especially in Italian Serie A (Italian football championship). To my mind, it is the consequence of lack of sports sprit. The fact that sportsmen are ready to neglect their honor and their sporting authority to please their greediness is terrible. Several decades ago sportsman was an example of imitation, people thought of them like honest, fair and strong. 
Some other people claim that the fact of significant amount of money in sport does not play any role in the game itself. Sportsmen all over the world get high wages. And not everyone agrees with that. People who deal with sport, certainly risk their health and life and they should be paid properly but not such millions that they receive now. Money is a good stimulus but not the only one. I think that sportsman is someone who is born for doing it. Moreover, I consider, for instance, footballers not to do their job but to do their vocation.
Summing up what is raised at the beginning, I'd like to say that sport of the 20th century or the 19th is completely different of what people name 'sport' now. Sportsmen earn too much, I think, and for some of them this can be a real problem. The most of sportsmen have come from poverty and many of them cannot cope with such huge amount of money; I mean sport for them is a mean towards money. So, in my opinion, the spirit of sporting competition still has lived in sportsmen's minds but not in all of them, unfortunately.
