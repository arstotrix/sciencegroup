                                      Some people think that animals can be used for the benefit of humans;                                                     Others think animals should be protectedSince the first Homo sapiens switched over to hunting from gathering the new period in the history of mankind started.  This new period wasmarked by the conversion of the modern human to the top of the food chain. Since that period modern human started to tame animals and use themfor the good of primitive society. Today animals are still being used for the sake of the society flourishing what causes social unrest andharsh discussions.First of all, it is always important to bear in mind the quotation from the Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's novella "The Little Prince": "You becomeresponsible, forever, for what you have tamed". However, in majority of cases we do see the symbiosis between man and animal, for instance,animals on the farm get special care for the products they produce.There is another perception of the issue. In accordance with this perception animals are considered to be an independent life form that isobliged to have its own way of development and the law system that will protect it from the human intervention and cruelty. The followingstatement might have sounded reasonable providing that animals themselves could have composed their law system. Fortunately or not, animals donot have language and are unable to compose anything therefore people retained the right to create this law system. From an outsider's viewpointsuch behavior, particularly the exaggerated humanism, looks much like the hypocrisy.In the world where every day millions of people die from hunger and disease someone would rather protect the rights of badly treated hamsters orfishes. The amount of cynicism and snobbery is such cases is overwhelming. Animals have another, completely different, nature and through theyears of taming they got used to being under control. Animals do not have free will and they do not entertain themselves with the questions ofmorality.Moreover, people have already got accustomed to getting goods from animals, for example products and material. Most of these goods cannot bereplaced today even with the usage of the modern technologies.To conclude I would like to argue that the issue of the animal rights is rather critical. From my point of view animal protection is not thefirst-priority problem and animal protectors are dreamers and fools who do not understand the real order of things. Dreamers are dangerous andshould be isolated.
