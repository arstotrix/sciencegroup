The chart shows the number of women and men getting part-time and full-time education in three periods of time 1970/1971, 1980/1981 and 1990/1991.
The common tendency for both men and women was that the number of those who got full-time education rose over the periods, for education became available for wide sections of population. However, this increase is less regular in women’s chart than in men’s one – 50 (in 1970), 200 (in 1980), 250 (in 1990) and 100 (in 1970), 150 (in 1980), 250 (in 1990) – all in thousands  – correspondingly.  
Nevertheless, the trends for men and women in part-time education are quite different. While the number of women had been continually and significantly increasing, - from 750 thousands in 1970 to 800 in 1980 and then to 1100 in 1990 - the number of men was high at first (100 thousands in 1970), but in 1980 it decreased by 150 thousands, possibly because of the fertility in 1960th or the low prestige of the part-time education, when men chose full-time education or work rather than part-time education. Then there was a slight increase in 1990 – by 50 thousands of men who got part-time education.
To sum up, although in 1990th there was a decrease in the number of the men getting part-time education, a common feature for both men and women was education becoming more and more popular in the end of the 20th century.
