Nowadays, blogs are an important part of our social life. We use them as newspapers, as diaries, as social networks. But we still don't know what they really are. Some of us think that blog is a new literature genre. Others claim that it is just a new form of text, whose specific visual features are caused by Internet possibilities. As for my opinion, I think blogs can not be described as a new genre at all. There are some blogs, that are very similar to usual publicist articles. For example, the A.Onoprienko's blog contains a lot of small notes about politics, society, history etc. I think, there is almost no difference between this blog and some series of articles in any journal. Other blogs are a kind of newspapers. It would be good to remark A.Navalniy's blog, which is quiet unusual. At the same time it can be defined as a news site, as publicistic blog, like previous one, and as a political blog with discussions, opinions and agitation. I don't think it's a whole new genre, but it is just about to develop into it. 
As for Internet diaries, the only difference from usual ones is that internet diaries are written for reading by wide audience, while the paper diaries are usually just a way for self-observation. I think this difference doesn't really matter.
