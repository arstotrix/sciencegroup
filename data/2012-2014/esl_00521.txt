Fry's English Delight Review
Once again Stephen Fry delights us with his "English Delight". It is his new radio program about English and language in general. This episode is dedicated to a controversial subject of sex and its effect on the way we speak.
First he starts with the background of this problem. It all begins in 1960s when the issue of feminism arises and becomes burning to the extend that it changes the language.
Then he proceeds to discussing famous gender stereotypes and it turns out that the real picture is more complicated than it appears. And of course he comes to the point when it is  evident that there are specific reasons to the way we speak and it does not lie on the gender differences only.
As a whole this program holds up to Fry's standards. He invites different people, professional and not providing different points of view. It is true pleasure to listen to this program for it is educational, smart, funny and infused with Fry's charisma and brilliant sense of humor.
