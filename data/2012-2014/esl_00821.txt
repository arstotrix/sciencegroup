The charts provide information on the main reasons for wildlife population changes from 2000 to the present and on the population figures for affected wild animal species.
For 43 per cent of cases, the main factor that influences changes of the wildlife population is habitat destruction. About a fifth of processes is caused by pollution, while overexploitation, namely, hunting and fishing, and random factors, such as accidents, cause over 15 per cent of changes respectively. The rest 10 per cent characterize the cases when wildlife is affected by diseases and introduction of exotic species.
Among these wild animals, positive tendencies are observed only among the mammals and some aquatic animals, except for the hedgehogs and water voles, with an average 15 per cent increase of species. The worst results show the figures of insect population, which has 43 per cent decline in animals number. The population of freshwater fish became about a fourth less. On the contrary, with over 10 per cent decrease, reptiles and birds population does not undergo huge changes.
To sum up, pollution and destruction of species habitat lead to the most changes of their population. While freshwater fish and insects are the creatures that mainly suffer from the factors listed above.
