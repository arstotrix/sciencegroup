Alternative energy resources.
Do you know that our traditional sources of energy such as oil, gas and coal are being spent so fast that in 40 years their stocks will be exhausted on our planet? It means that by 2050 we will not be able to use these conventional sources.
Moreover, scientists worry that the increasing demand for traditional types of resources and their usage is too harmful for the environment. For example, more than a year ago an explosion of an oil platform the Deepwater Horizon in the Mexican Gulf caused releasing up to 4.9 million barrels of crude oil, which had incredibly reduced oil stocks. The spill also caused extensive damage to marine and wildlife habitats and to the Gulf's fishing and tourism industries. 
The main question  is: "What can we use instead of disappearing resources, provided that it should be as environmentally friendly as possible?"
For this reason  scientists began to develop new types of energy which are called alternative or renewable. It is an alternative to fossil fuels and more economic and harmless. Alternative energy comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides and geothermal heat, which are renewable. And nowadays this sphere is promptly  developing.
The idea of using alternative energy is a good decision, but it has some negative sides too. For example, wind power can be produced only in windy weather and solar energy may be produced only in cloudless weather. In addition, in the countries which are less developed in the sphere of innovations these inventions would be difficult to implement. 
Despite all these disadvantages, in the future alternative energy development will help to decrease the impact on air pollution and water pollution and mitigation of climate change with using renewable energy. Do not forget that we have only 40 years to finally move to alternative methods of energy extraction.
