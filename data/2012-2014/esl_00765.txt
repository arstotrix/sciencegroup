  Information Technologies became an essential part of our everyday life and help us doing things not available earlier. For instance, they make real working on a distance and do not be dependent on the workplace. Some people believe that such way of working has a lot of advantages, while others consider that there are more drawbacks in it. 
   The cardinal virtue of remote work is that you don't have to waste your time to get to a workpost. Owing to new gadgets and laptops people can not to wake up early, stay in traffic jams and sit in office a fixed period of time. Such mobility economizes your time and enables a person to work in cosy atmosphere and appropriate pace. 
  However, there are a lot of points of view, which claims that IT don't simplify the process of working but instead cause a reduction of efficiency. Many scientists claim that our psychological well-being is closely related to the enviornment surrounding us. Thus, a lack of working atmosphere relaxes people and reduces the labor productivity. My personal experience confirms this point of view - I can't concentrate on the task in relaxed settings. Furthermore, on a jobsite people always communicate with their colleagues, ask for help and get new experience. 
  To sum it up, there is no doubt that Information Technologies give a significant amount of strengths in studying and working, but at the same time a lot of weaknesses exist and it is up to a person which way of working he or she prefers.
