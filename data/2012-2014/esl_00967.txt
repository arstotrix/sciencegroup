Men are more interested in sport than women 

The problem of interest of men and women in sport is very complex and difficult to solve. Different people have different views on it. Some of them believe that women are interested in sport as much as men, but there are those who have the opposite point of view, and I am among them.
I am absolutely convinced that a very small number of women are really interested in it. Firstly, nature has given women less developed muscle's than men. A woman has no such physical force. She is flexible, plastic, light and fragile. A woman's body is designed more for dancing than for heavy exercises. Secondly, typically women are more interested in something spiritual: in books and art. Often the men's fascination with football and basketball annoys wives very much. They don't understand what can be so interesting to chase the ball.
On the other hand, my critics think that women are equally with men interested in sport. There are many sports in the world, where women are involved. Some of them are purely female: figure skating, synchronized swimming. They are also frequent visitors of various fitness clubs to maintain their bodies in a good way.
However, women have long been regarded as the weaner sex. If a girl and is engaged in some kind of sport, more likely she tries to keep her body in order, she isn't fond of this sport seriously.
To conclude, I want to say that all women are different, some of them like sport, but the others don't. However, most of them prefer other hobbies.
