The two charts compare the rates of different weight assessments of inhabitants of Newtown according to age in 1950 and 2010. 
In 1950 the majority of people of every age had had ideal weight and only an insignificant number of people  between 40 and 69 suffered from obese. By 2010 the situation has changed dramatically: while the weight of the majority of people under 39 remained ideal, the rate of older people having obese increased dramatically up to 60% by people aged 60-69. While in 1950 people under 40 had not have obese, in 2010 there have been people with obese in all the age groups, the rate rising with the age up to 60%.
In 1950 70% of 20 to 29 years olds had had ideal weight and 30% were underweight. In 2010 the situation changed slightly as about 5% of young people under 29 had overweight and less than 5% had obese. The share of ideal and overweight of  30-39 years old people remained relatively stable, but the number of underweight people in this age group has fallen from 20% to about 1%, while 10% got obese. The situation in the age group of 40-49 is similar to the previous one, but the rate of people with obese counts 25% by 2010.
