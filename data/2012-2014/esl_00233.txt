Nowadays taking risks has become very popular. Modern people are very brave, they are not afraid to take risks, even if it puts their life in danger.
The thing is, people can risk in two ways: first, when they put their life in danger and second, when there is no harm to their health. In my opinion, people who belong to the first group make thoughtless acts just for fun or to become popular. In most of these cases it is teenagers who just don't think of any consequences. Undoubtedly, if everything ends well, they will be popular and successful, but, to my mind, it's a wrong and stupid way for achieving such aim as popularity.
The situation about the second group seems more interesting to me. Their risk is not so thoughtless. These people may have serious aims, so in some situations they just cannot manage without taking risks. For example, such famous people as Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg had risked a lot of things: friendship, studying at university, losing money, etc. However, all their free time and all their life they devote to their work. As we can see, they have become very successful.
Besides, there is a third group of people taking risks: those who don't damage their health but take risks just to see what will happen after that. Their motto is something like, "Let's take a risk, maybe we'll succeed in it!" The word "maybe" here is the main thing; therefore, it becomes a lottery in some way. They can be lucky and successful in something, but they can also fail.
In conclusion, I believe that taking risks is not a bad thing on the whole although I personally don't like anything risky. However, in my opinion, if people take a risk, they should do it for serious aims and not just for fun or to get some adrenaline.
