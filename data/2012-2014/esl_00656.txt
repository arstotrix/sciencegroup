Nowadays most people consider shopping as a kind of entertainment, while in the past it was regarded mainly as a routine domestic task. As for one, it’s a necessary everyday work but I don’t see a way and sense to enjoy it.
First of all, people spend a huge amount of time on choosing something. They start being in a good mood but then, finish without any satisfaction. The reason, I think, is our limited budgets and many details such as size or date of production we have to keep in mind. Another problem is that shopping is one of the best time-killers if you don’t have a clear plan in your mind, which is not always easy to do.
Moreover, while shopping, people get tired fast because they waste a lot of emotions, therefore they feel extremely tired and empty.
However, some people will not agree with me, saying that at least we have a wide range of choice and even by looking at beautiful things we start feeling better. Here I would like to say that buying a new coat is not a goal of our lives, that is why we should limit the time we spend on it in order not to be hooked on shopping. Otherwise we will spend precise hours on staring at a thing, while our life will be passing.
Overall, our society is considered to be consumer one and many teens and old-aged people are hooked on spending a lot of time on buying something that is not necessary. I have to say that shopping is an essential part of our life but not the most important and enjoyable one.
