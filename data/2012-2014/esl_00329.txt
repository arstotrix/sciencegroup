Every generation is unique. Adults always say young people are not what they were. These words are repeated from generation to generation.essay
First of all, we have to say that teenagers do not accept the standarts of their parents. Why is that going on? To my mind, the main reason is that parents believe they are always right because they are older. In fact, they just do not want their values to be questioned. Most parents generally talk AT their children not TO them. If you ask teenagers if their parents criticize them, in most cases they will answer affirmatively. On the other hand, teenagers just are not willing tolisten to parents. So we have a witched circle and it seems there is no solution to the problem.
I believe that we should start with the idea of respect. One will never be able to understand someone else without trying to respect him or his opinion at least. Of course, parents have much more life experience than their children and they do not want their children to repeat their own mistakes. Howevr, adults should listen to their child's opinion and try not to pay any attention to ther age in some cases. As for children, they should not forget that their parents are people who are always ready to support them.
In conclusion I would like to say that the problem of generation gap has been, is and will always be in our life. But that does not mean we can even try to solve it. As I said above, to my mind, the first step is to listen and respect.
