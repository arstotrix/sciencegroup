I haven't read none of these books, so I had a sort of advantage. 
But most of the reviews didn’t really impress me. I didn't find the review on "To Kill a Mocking Bird" good because it spoils not a plot in common, but really important points of it, like "Atticus demonstrates that Tom isn't villain, but the other character is". So I already know that Tom will be acquitted, but it seems to me like one of the biggest twists of a plot and now everything is ruined, plot is spoiled and reading won’t be so fascinating like it could be before. So this review is more like a brief summary for those who didn't read the book but need to do it before literature classes: there are all the important facts, there are all the problems, take it and write your test. 
The reviews on Steven Pinker’s book seemed to me too overfull with a personal opinion. It's great when review shows negative sides of the book too, but not in such expressive way. I think that review is more neutral genre, it's not a critique. I don't really sure that I want read this book after such persuasive article. But is it a real objective of writing a review, to persuade someone to read or not to read something?
The last review on "Three Men in a Boat (to say nothing of the dog)" is the best between all of them. The retelling of the plot is just like it need to be - short, superficial but it awakes interest to this book. Author adds also a little bit of the personal opinion, but in unobtrusive way. So, after reading this review, I think I need to make my own opinion on the book of J. K. Jerome.
