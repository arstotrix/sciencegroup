 What would have happened or what it would be like now if something hadn't happened in my life.
     I want to tell you something about my life. I don’t know what have happened or what it would be like now if I hadn’t gone to Moscow and had stayed at home, I can just suppose. 
    I don’t know what can I do now. I think about my life, education, parents and friends. If I hadn’t gone to Moscow for studying, I would live in Tashkent with my parents. Now I miss them. I know, if I had stayed in Tashkent, I would have to pay the contract at the university. Now I am studying in Russia free but I hadn’t this chance in my country. I clearly understand it. 
   I had entered in two universities and I had chosen HSE. If I hadn’t chosen HSE, I would live in social behavior in Moscow. If I had lived in social behavior in Moscow, I wouldn’t know about dirty train from Moscow to Odintsovo.
   I have a little sister in Tashkent. Her name is Masha. If I had stayed in Tashkent, I would see how my little sister grows up. I miss her. I haven’t seen her for 6 months. If I hadn’t gone to Moscow, I would see how my brother finished school and celebrated his prom. 
     This situation have positive moments too. If I hadn’t gone to Moscow, I wouldn’t know about one super girl. Her name is Sasha. She is from Moldova. If we hadn’t studied in one university, we wouldn’t had chance to meet each other. She is the kindest person who I ever met. I love her. She helps me in this city. We help each other in mega polis. 
   If I hadn’t entered in Moscow university, I wouldn’t know some interesting subjects, but now, I seriously think about my future profession. 
     I can’t decide what I must do but I want to make a right decision.
