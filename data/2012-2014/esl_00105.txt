Creativity and order.
Recently I was surfing the web and came across a notice: 'We are looking for a creative person to  with us in our studio.' There were also several photos of this flat. It was very ancient  and original, but everywhere  was a terrible mess. So, did they mean that a creative person should be untidy and should not like the order? And is it true that a person whose room is tidy must be called down-to-earth and narrow-minded? How does creativity relate to order?
John Cleese in his speech on creativity claims structured mind and purposefulness to be closely related to a 'close mode'. And when a person is in  close mode, he is unable to create something new.
Surely, I cannot but agree with John. For example, one of my acquaintances always sleeps seven hours per day. He cannot sleep less if he wants to watch a wonderful film and he cannot afford himself to sleep more if he wants to relax  Sunday morning. Rules like this govern his life. I am afraid  that he is always in a close mode  and that prevent him from doing something creative, beautiful and maybe even crazy. Moreover, it makes him constrained and maybe  unhappy.
But  at the same time  I cannot agree that to be creative the person have to be careless and have to behave disorderly. I know a girl who is extremely creative. She plays drums, she wears in a very original way, she is very free, she was a hippy earlier. But at the same time she is a structured person, very purposeful and disciplined. Her creativity goes from the way of thinking, which is very free and bright. As for me, free and bright unconstrained mind does not mean disorder in the soul and in the room.
Finally, I want to say that everywhere it is better to find the golden mean. We must not be afraid of our crazy creative ideas but we must not loose our mind completely.
