In today’s world artist have to work hard to become popular and get a lot of money. Some people think that it is unfair in regard to artists who live in poverty and struggle to survive. There are is an opinion that government has to resolve this situation, but I would like to present some reasons why government can nothing to do with it. 
Firstly, every successful artist was poor and took little money for they work. You have to become a famous artist to earn a lot of money.  But nobody become famous in a moment. It is a hard work which takes a many years. Thus, everybody is in the same position at the beginning. Secondly, government cannot take money away from successful artists, because people decide by themselves how to spend their money. 
There can be no doubt that painting pictures is the same work as all another and there is career ladder as well. Someone have the goal, big talent and always work at self-improvement. Another don’t accomplish a great deal. They have to decide to try yourself in another way or keep doing what he or she isn’t the best. At last, It is should be someone who better then you to catch up him.
In conclusion I would like to say that not much in our live is fair. And nobody have an opinion that government should take steps to resolve “unfair” situation with another professions where someone receive huge sums of money while others struggle to survive, so why artists differ from another professions?
