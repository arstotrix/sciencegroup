 The table shows us number of children born to Australian women aged 40-44 years for each year the information was collected since 1981.
 
  First inference that we can do, it is that women in Australia prefer to have two children and the number of them grows every year. According to the information, in 1981 it was 29% and in 2006 it was 38.3%. 
 Also, we can see that number of women who have more than three children decrease from 1981 year to 2006 year more than 16%. By the fact, we can understand that percentage of women who have more than three children will decrease in near future. Second reason for this decision is that number of women who had giving birth for two children had the biggest increase and women who have only one child or none have the upward trend. On the other hand, number of women who have three children decrease only of 6%. 
   In the total, the number of women decides to have two, one or none children has increased since 1981, while the women who prefer to have more than two children decrease every year.
