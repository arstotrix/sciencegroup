Nowadays there is a debate on whether upaid work for the community should be included into high school programmes. In this essay I am going to consider the arguments for and against this idea.
I personally disagree only with some aspects of it. First, I think that high school students should concentrate on their main subjects. They should have an opportunity to get a proper education, while taking part in some unpaid service would lessen it since the work could take rather much time.
secondly, the students may not have properly developed skills needed for this kind of work. So some specialists in the fields such as charity and sports teaching would be needed, since this unpaid work is supposed to be a part of educational programmes and the students should be first taught how to do it.
On the other hand, taking part in such service could help students in their socialisation. They may encounter some interesting people and establish important contacts for their future lives. Moreover, the experience of volunteer work is priceless, especially in the young age. It is a great feeling when one helps other people without being paid. I can say this, as I personally have a substantional volunteer work experience. Also this work can make one ready for getting a paid job in the future.
In sum, I think that including unpaid service into high school programmes could be a useful idea providing that doing it will not take too much time and that students will be properly instructed on the ways they are supposed to do their work.
