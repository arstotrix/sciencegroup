This research shows us what places are popular among different people living in Australia. Among people born in Australia the most visited one is cinema (over 70%), second is zoo (40%), third is library (a little less than 40%) and the last one is theatre (20%). People who came to Australia from English-speaking countries also prefer cinema (75%), then goes zoo (50%), library (40%) and theatre (25%). For people, who came from non-English-speaking countries situation is different. First of all they prefer visiting library (55%), secondly the cinema (50%), thirdly the zoo (35%) and only 10% of them goes to the theatre.  
Judging by these results we can see than those who don't speak English prefer to spend their time studying in a library or going to the zoo where language skills are not so necessary. Otherwise, native speakers prefer to spend their time watching movies because they have no understanding problems. Popularity of theatre among English-speaking migrants can be explained by them being interested in cultural events and having no language barrier to stop them. 
To sum it up I'd like to say, that cinema is the most visited place for people all over the world mostly because it's cheap and everybody are used to it.
