 Architecture is the art of building graceful structures from wood, a stone, iron, etc. I can not agree that architecture is the mother of all arts, because every art is unique. At the same time, many people were inspired by architecture. As for me,walking through the city with rich historical architecture, such as St. Petersburg, not only the eye, but also the heart is gladdened.
    Even in ancient times people equip made there houses more beautiful inside and outside. They wanted to outdo their neighbors. 
    Exist many architecture styles of different eras and times like gothic, romanesque, baroque, classicism, modern, empire and many others. Most of them interact and coexist, for instance in Moscow, we can see old churches preserved till now near modern skyscrapers.
  In our days distinction between art, design and architecture is almost erased. One art follows from another one. In 21 century the most developed is ecological architecture, because it is fashionable to create something natural, for example Fallingwater or Kaufmann Residence : a house designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wrigh. The new architecture should make spaces intentionally multifunctional.
