   The bar chat below shows the percentage of the weight assessment of inhabitants of Newton 2010.
    The biggest number of people with the obese were people from 60 to 69. On the contrary, people from 30 to 39 had the smallest weight and there were only 1 percent of these people. Most of the inhabitants had ideal figures except the oldest inhabitants. Only 5 % of people from 60 to 69 had ideal figures.
    A more detailed look at the chart can help us to see that older people have more problems with their weight than young people. The older man is, the more weight he has and the percent of obese people rises for the years. The differences between 40-49 people and 50-59 people were really big. Only 4 % of 50-59 people had the overweight while the percent of 40-49 with the overweight was much more bigger. There were 35 % of 40-49  people with the overweight. It is 7 times more than people from 50 to 59.
   Clearly, there were different trends for young and old people over this period, but there were much more young people with ideal weight than old ones.
