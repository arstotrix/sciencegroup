Some people suffer from nerves when they have to communicate with others or give a presentation. They worry, that they couldn't hold the attention of their interlocutors.
But if they extend their vocabulary, they will be confident persons, who doesn't stammer and crack under pressure of the audience, and they'll become great public speakers.
I have many problems with the communication. I always stammer because I suffer from nerves, so I can't make a good impression. In addition, if I'm not aware of the theme of the discussion, I can't get a word in edgeways.
However I stay polite all the time, even if my interlocutor irritates me.
