Everything in our life is somehow connected with colors. They surround us everywhere. A man can find a lot of articles how food of different colors influences people’s health, how emotions depend on the color palette of the environment. So do colors affect our lives?
In my opinion, color that surrounds us is of a great importance. Since ancient times, people have paid attention to the fact that the colors of the surrounding world have a special influence on people. Today it is scientifically confirmed. Scientist have made an experiment and found out that being in the room, where the temperature is about +15-17 C, a healthy man in a shirt with short sleeves does not feel cold if the color of the walls is bright yellow or orange, but at the same temperature a person freezes in a room with blue-gray walls.
Moreover, color environment influences capacity for work. There is a statement that great Goethe when he was creating different types of work, he used spectacles with different-colored glasses. He noted that red and yellow give energy to people, meanwhile blue causes depression, loss of a good mood. In addition, there was another experiment in the office and it turned out that in an office with blue walls employees are more likely drink coffee than in the offices of other colors because blue color stimulates drowse. Furthermore, workers in “blue” offices more often put on weight, because blue tone slows down the body's metabolism.
Despite the fact that some people do not believe in the power of colors, a lot of doctors use a color therapy as a treatment to restore the activity of the organism with the help of impact of color.
To conclude, influence of colors on people’s vital functions were known even in ancient times. In this case, designers should think through all details while decorating a room in such a way that a man in it could do their best and feel comfortable.
