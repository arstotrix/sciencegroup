The phonetic variation is a phenomenon that spread in Russian language nowadays. For "A study of language phonetic variation in Russian language" course project motivation comes from the fact that in the last fifty years a few was done to develop this field of research, there is no data provided that could explain the reasons of appearance of this phenomenon and show in which occurrences which variants are used . Also there is a lack of electronic databases in which new data could be added. Such databases would be useful for linguists and for people who are interested in Russian language and its development. It would help to trace the development of phonetic variation in Russian language over a long time period. The creating of such database is one of the aims of the project. 
This course paper focuses on vowel realization ("a" or "ы") after a hushing in Russian words. The last research was done by Avanesov sixty years ago. The results are published in his book "Russian literature pronunciation". So, the study is relevant. In Avanesov`s work only the final results of his work are given but the methods of the research are not described and no statics is given, however, in my work methods play an important role . The purpose of this work is to explain a vowel variation ("a" or "ы") after a hushing by sociolinguistics methods. The other aim is to find out how this kind of variation depends on such social factors as education, social status and age.
