--Have you heard about the new staged version of "Ulysses"? I've seen so many raving reviews, but I'm sure it to be exaggerated. Joyce cannot be interesting for such a wide audience until they all are really high-brow, which I doubt.

-- I used to read a course of its director at university and he'd invited me, so I've been to the dress-rehearsal,. I knew it would bomb, even there it got a standing  applause. Undoubtedly, it cannot be understood by philistine public, but it is really an "one-breath-per-hour" play. You surely have to see it to understand what I mean.
