The chronicle of great human inventions starts since the very first homo sapience was born. Starting from this crucial event humankind never stopped developing and continues to make progress in a number of spheres of life introducing significant breakthroughs almost every day.  In the XXI century the field, which attracts most of the attention, is technology and nowadays with the use of it people can become all-powerful. Some people believe that such boundless opportunities put bad influence on the ability to learn, whereas others consider this idea conformist.

At first glance, such a “conformist” idea seems appealing to truth as today children are interested only in gadgets and video games. They are no longer read books, their language is poor and the system of values bases on the idea of permissiveness. Their memory is poor owing to the concept of “everything can be found on the Internet”, they have no imagination, critical and abstract thinking. But going deeper in this issue discloses a number of peculiarities, which makes modern technologies unguilty of massive degradation. 

The problem with children lies in the upbringing failure. Most of the parents are convinced that by giving their children a gadget they rescue themselves from the parenting duty. Moreover, the more accomplished the gadget is the more complex its controls are. That is why such basic skills as mental calculations are replaced by the skills of controlling the gadget.

In conclusion it has to be said that every generation used to accept every novelty with hostility and great minds of each epoch used to be disappointed by the future of the humankind in advance. Nevertheless, almost every era can boast of great writers, mathematicians, inventors and great noble people. There is no doubt that today it is very difficult to become great but still people who are able to amaze others can be found.
