Abstract
Despite the abundance of research in the sphere of language variation, many aspects characterizing the speech of different social groups remain unstudied. The purpose of the present work is to study the connections between the stress pattern and the social group of speaker. Eight Russian verbs with the ambulatory stress such as "zvónit-zvonít" are considered.
The research method was to observe the unconscious choices of stress pattern. The technique of reading and replacing pictures with some words appeared to be highly productive. Additionally, the informants provided their own opinion towards the right variant. Finally the comparison of the conscious pronunciation and the unconscious one was carried out.
No common tendencies were found as the result. Each verb has got its own characteristics. The social diversity of the certain stress variants confirmed to exist; all the correlations with people's age and level of education are presented in the course paper. The outcomes support the view that norm is quickly changing and this can depend considerably on the social characteristics of people.
