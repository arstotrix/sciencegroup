Some parents want their children to start studying as early as possible. It means to get not the advanced knowledge, but some basic skills that may be useful in further child’s education. In some countries the suitable age to start is four years. But isn’t it too early for little ones to get into the science world?
For example, in Russian educational system children begin their educational way in the daycares, when they study reading or writing, but it is not obligated. It also exist pre-scholar educational centers where children do preparations for school  life, and after that they can read and write on the elementary level. Although I didn’t attend such a center, in the beginning of school time I was already owned these skills because my parents had a lot of time reading books with me. So I think the early education is required to avoid problems at school.
From the other side, the children’s minds may be “overloaded” by plenty of information given at earlier period of their life. So it has to be a right method of starting the education suited for each child. If a child doesn’t want to study at all at his four or five years, parents don’t need to enforce him right at this moment, but wait for some time, and try again. The enforcement can lead a negative consequences and the child may have a lot of problems during the whole scholar period as he might think the education is like a punishment or a mess.
To finish my thoughts I can say that the early formal education is definitely good for each child of 4-5 years, but it should be applied in an individual order, according to the temperament of each child.
