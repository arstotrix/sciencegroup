In my opinion it's a rather contradictory question. On the one hand the gap between two generations is caused not only by the lack of knowledge and attention, but also by the difference of the cultural surroundings which produces a really huge discord of the life's values and the world view. But on the other hand the relationship between children and their parents will surely become better if both sides learn to communicate, to be ready for contact, to understand each other and accept each other's pecularities, learn to listen, not to judge or to blame. The harmony is impossible without eny effort. That's why I can't really agree or disagree with this statement.
