In September 2003 Russia joined the Bologna process. The aims of it were improvement of the quality of European education, encouragement of students' mobility, facilitation of job placement for young specialists. But for Russia joining this process brought about a plenty of difficulties. 
For instance, the division of educational process into two steps, which are baccalaureate and magistracy, means a lot of problems for students, but does not correspond with the primary idea in a proper way. The idea was that the bachelor education would meet the requirements of a mass demand for education and the magistracy education would create skillful professionals of the higher class. 
But in reality after the baccalaureate the young person has to enter the university for the second time and he/she continues to be under-graduate, he/she cannot find a good job in his field. Surely, he/she might have an opportunity to work for a year as an assistant, but anyway he/she have to enter magistracy if he/she wants  his/her education to be completed. Maybe I'm mistaken, but now a bachelor has few of possibilities, he/she is just at the step before becoming a real professional. If so, what is this step needed for?
