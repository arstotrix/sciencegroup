The issues of professional oriented programs in psychotherapy and psychological counseling. 
The effectiveness of psychotherapy depends on many factors. It was assigned most important common factors required for successfull psychotherapy such us: client/extra-therapeutic factors (client variable and outside events impinging on client's life) account  for 40% of therapy's outcome variance; relationship factors account for 30% (caring, warmth, encouragement and other variables which therapist offered while psychotherapy); placebo, hope and expectancy contribute to 15% to improvement in therapy; models and techniques contribute 15% to treatment outcome. This study connected with relationship factor where  liberal share of outcomes depend on psychotherapists personal characteristics. There are studies which show  personal characteristics  important for relationship factor, but for the present there is no certainty about professional training methods which develop personal characteristics of psychotherapists.   The hypothesis is that different professional trainings result in different sets of different personal characteristics of psychotherapists.
