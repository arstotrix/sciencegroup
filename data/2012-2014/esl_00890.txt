Erlend Loe "Doppler"
 
 
Doppler is a novel written in 2004 by Norwegian writer Erlend Loe.
Loe is one of the most famous modern Scandinavian novelists among Peter Høeg, Jo Nesbø, Stieg Larsson and others. He is best known for his outstanding “Naïve. Super.”(1996), which was translated into over 20 languages.
Doppler is his fifth novel. One of my favorite ones written by him.
Loe wrote several well-known books all in hybrid genre of essay and satirical tragicomedy:
-          Gone with the Woman
-          Naïve. Super
-          L
-          Fakta om Finland
-          Doppler
-          Volvo Trucks
-          Muleum
-          Fvonk
-          Vareopptelling
 
Especially being loved in Russia Loe writes about deep and unidentified sadness which is clear to every Russian – “toska”. However, his prose is childish bright, naive, full of irony and satire. Since his first work - "Gone with the Woman"(1992), Loe`s main character is almost always a young man, who tries to figure out what is what in his life. And something tells us, all his main heroes are more than fully – Loe himself.
 
The setting of the Doppler story is the modern Norway, Oslo suburb. Main character is wealthy man in his 30-s who lives with his wife and two kids in a brand new cottage. Their neighborhood is inhabited by other wealthy families, so the other part of the city is. It seems from the book that Norway is full of “calm and steady people who take their free time to thoroughly consume”.
 
“Doppler” is a first person narrative telling about the young man Doppler - yuppie of 30 y.o. who made a decision to abandon civilization (his cottage) moving to the nearest forest (edge of the nearest private forest thicket, actually) to live in tent. The reason is not clear enough till we find out that lately his life has made a sharp bend: his father died unexpectedly. The man whom Doppler even didn't know well had left behind only pack of toilets photos (no, literally) and strange wish to bury him together with rhythm egg in his pocket. Sounds strange, but that kind of details is the usual Loe’s method to describe ironically the reality and to highlight casual awkwardness. Somehow, Doppler decided that his life was wrong till that very moment, he needs to reconsider it and to change everything. It is funny how he left his family and they didn`t feel hard about that. Usually such types of decisions are not compatible with living. But he managed to find way to find food (berries and an elk meat) and even 0% fat milk. At the same time, his wife is OK to be pregnant with third child and still to bring up two others. In the forest Doppler has found the little elk Bongo, built a totem in the name of his father, stolen giant Tobleron chocolate and casually departed deep in the woods together with his 5 years old son.
All of that is slightly surrealistic. Just slightly. But the feeling of fairy-tail reading doesn`t leave after finishing the book.
 
So the official theme of the book is revision of one man`s life, “modern asceticism” and “search for inner freedom”. The real theme lies in the field of modern art when you can`t say straightforward what has touched your heart and why.
 
Doppler – is a naive novel built with short lapidary sentences and flavored with satire and irony - that`s the easily recognizable Loe’s style.
 
It is rather hard for me to compare Doppler to any other similar fiction. But these are the names which come to my head when I think about Doppler and Loe`s prose:
-          Representatives of the American Beat Generation literature – “beatniks” Jack Keruak, Richard Brautigan.
-          Kurt Vonnegut and Joseph Heller.
-          Japanese essayists Ryūnosuke Akutagawa and Jun'ichirō Tanizaki
Most of them (Brautigan, Tanizaki) were named by Loe as his “teachers” in his interviews.
 
Would I recommend this book? To whom?
Yes, to anyone. Literally. That’s the main charm of the book and Erlend Loe style itself. He has no goal to convince in anything or to implement any idea. What he wants is to catch the “lightness of being” hold it, focus his sight on it and show to others. The book can be simply considered to reading by anyone because it is naïve and super.
