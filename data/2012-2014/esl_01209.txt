Nowadays there are more and more opportunities for everyone to be entertained. And modern sport industry is a large entertainment machine too. It is simple to be involved in sport for everyone through watching television or matches on the stadium. Does it stimulate us to do sports – or does it make an illusion that just watching sports is enough?
Personally, I have never been really involved in any sport but I think that coverage of sport on television works as an advertisement. Almost everything in our life works according to the rules of an advertising. Once we see it, we want it. Firstly, sport stars are usually role models for young people. Watching sports on TV encourage them to be as strong, as successful, as popular as their favorite sportsmen.  Secondly, there are adults who are encouraged to keep fit and not to keep up with the times.  
On the other hand, some people claim that watching sports has been replacing doing sports in our mind recent years. We have a feeling that we have it enough in our life without actually doing it.
I disagree with this opinion because I believe that having or not having such illusions is our personal choice. And nobody can choose instead of us. People accuse television when they themselves cannot solve problems, for instance, with their busyness or, in contrast, laziness. 
To sum up, I can say that sports is good in almost any circumstances. And it would not be as popular as it is, if so many people did not really love doing it. So I do not think that television has so much influence in this area of our life.
