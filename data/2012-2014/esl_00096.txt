In this paper, J.Aaker explore impact of brand on the formation of consumer's behavior.  so-called, brand personality can be very influential in consumer's buying habits with regards to a particular product or service. The author considers the brand personality as a set of human characteristics associated with the brand. 
In this study J.Aaker develops approaches for measuring the brand personality. The aim of her research is to develop a specific measurement scale that has the qualities of reliability, validity and generalization, and has practical and theoretical applications. The theoretical application is that it allows correlating the resulting study of five characteristics of the brand personality with the "Big Five". While previous research which mantains that the components of the brand personality characteristics correspond to the individual personality of the consumer, provides counter-arguments to Aaker's. The practical application is developing a scale to measure the correlation between consumers' personality features and the brand personality.
This paper is the first and successful attempt to create a generalized and reasonable scale of brand personality.
