Nowadays science has evolved dramatically in space technologies. Who would even imagine that people could go to space as a tourist? 
I think that business and science cannot live without each other. They have close cooperation over the time. Business helps a lot to develop many ideas and projects that could make them profit and thus, be useful for the rest of people. For example, humankind could not afford cars, planes, computers and mobile phones without involving business in these projects. And I suppose that the same thing happens with the space problem today. In my opinion, investing money in space tourism makes only the best for space exploration. I think it is normal that touristic industry wants to get involved in the development of space tourism and it is not because of making money but because it is the future with space. To my mind, it is completely in the order of things that people try to know the unknown.
Of course, we cannot talk about space tourism as a fact, because it should take much more time before a man could be a space tourist like an ordinary tourist in any foreign country. Today these ‘tourists’ are prepared like real astronauts and pay for the trip of their life millions of dollars. Nobody will deny, if I say that this voyage is not affordable. And it is needless to say that space is the most dangerous place for people because we do not know enough about it. But still people desire about being in outer space. 
The real thing is that space tourism is not a dream; it develops right in front of our eyes. The only thing that hinders the process is the necessity of a completely new type of fuel that would not increase the weight of a spaceship and would allow traveling longer distances. My strong belief is if this leap in technologies happens mankind will stand on the brink of striking discoveries.
