Choosing from all skills in the leaflet, I'm very good at using tone of my voice, dressing smartly and staying calm and polite at all times. But I have some "minuses".  I sometimes can't hold the attention of speaker, can interrupt (very rarely).  I also need to practice in considering my potential listeners.
