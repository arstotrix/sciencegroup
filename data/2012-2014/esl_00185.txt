Much money has been invested in sport for a long time. However, some people think that the spirit of sporting competition has been destroyed byamount of money now associated with most sports.To my opinion, a great deal of money invested in sport does not  destroy its spirit at all and can even increase it.To begin with, much money is spent for organizing various competitions and championships and building stadiums which gives an opportunity towatch competitions themselves or on the TV. It certainly increases competitive spirit as there are more and more people from all over the worldsupporting their favorite sportsmen.Another huge part of money is invested in sport shows with stars. To my mind, it does not differ from usual sport competitions as all theparticipants have the same goal as the sportsmen - to do their best and to win. The difference is only in level of the participants.It can be supposed that if there is much money involved in sport, sport organizations become corrupted. Professional sportsmen who earn muchmoney might arrange things to get more money and share it. However, t does not seem possible because if many people are watching sports, theycertainly notice if someone does careless work.To sum up, I would like to say it is hard to destroy the spirit of sport as long as it remains a competition between people because it isnaturally for humans to wish to be better than other ones.
