The table above illustrates the changes in the birth rate in Australia since 1981 to 2006 according to interrogation of women at the age 40-44 years.
We see that the quantity of the women who haven’t got a child at this age increased almost by half since the beginning of the research. Also the number of women having many children reduced noticeably.
However some ratios keep stables: during 25 years of research the majority of mothers have two children.
We can note as well that indices in all the columns change gradually, there are no abrupt changes: the part of childless women rises smoothly and the quantity of people who have four or more children also declines fluently.
All this changes are typical for west countries; they could be provoked by women’s emancipation, reducing of infant mortality and many other causes.
