Short-term and Long-term effects of violent media on aggression in children and adults.
This article reviews the studies and theories devoted to the problem of violent media effects on aggression in children and adults. The main objective of this article is to accumulate the existing theoretical and empirical conception ofthe effects of violent media on further aggressive in children and adults behavior. The hypothesis of this study is that short-term effect of violent media on aggression will be larger for adults than for children. In contrast, they expected that the long-term effect of violent media on aggression will be larger for children than for adults. The paper uses the method of meta-analysis. Two criteria were used for selection studies for meta-analysis. First, the study needed to include a measure or manipulation of violent media exposure (f.e.TV programs, films, video games etc). Second, the studyneeded to includea measure of aggressive behavior, aggressive cognition, aggressive affect, physiological arousal, or helping behavior. To retrieve relevant studies, researches searched the database from 1887 to 2000. A total of 431 studies involving 68 463 participants met these criteria. There were 264 studies involving 50 312 children and 167 studies involving 18 151 adult. The effect size index was the correlation coefficient. In the study hypothesis was confirmed . This is consistent with the theory that short-term effects are mostly due to the priming of existing well encoded scripts, schemas, or beliefs whereas long-term effects require the learning of scripts, schemas, or beliefs.
