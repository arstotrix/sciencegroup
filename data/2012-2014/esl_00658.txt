The graph and table show information about population growth and the proportion of the population over 65 years in the period of time between 1950 and 2055 in Japan.
As can be seen from the graph, the population had been increasing very rapidly since 1950 till 2055, when it achieved a peak of 127,8 millions. After the peak year it is anticipated that the population of Japanese will decline.
Moreover, when reducing of the population will be expected, the percentage of people over 65 will reach 41% that is 8 times as high in 2055 as it was in 1950.
So, it is expected, that Japan's population, after a critical rising, will become almost the same it was in 1950 (89,9 and 84,1 respectively). And Japanese aged 65 and older will be a half of the total population.
