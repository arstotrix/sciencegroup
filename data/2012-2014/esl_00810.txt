These days, many tasks are completed with the help of modern technology. In many cases, it makes the process faster and easier. However, some people believe that modern technology influences our ability to acquire some basic skills and I absolutely agree to this idea. We rely on technology so much that sometimes we are not able to do usual things without it.
One of the spheres that are mostly influenced by technical innovations is our intellectual abilities. For instance, the calculator created long time ago is a huge invention that simplifies our calculations. At the same time, most students fail to complete elementary mathematical operation without it, even though they studied it at school.
Another example is presented by the spell checkers, which a lot of modern programs have. In some cases, they correct mistakes in writings which we would even mention and it is their serious advantage. But once we have to write a text without this function or by hand, most probably the text will be full of spelling mistakes.
Another sphere has to do with human survival skills, which people had had until modern technologies appeared. For instance, crock-pots allow us prepare food without having any culinary abilities. Moreover, many people use lighters to light the fire and have trouble do it without it.
Overall, many examples show that it is hard to imagine modern everyday life without using modern technology. In many cases, our reliance on it makes us helpless and unable to fulfill easy tasks.
