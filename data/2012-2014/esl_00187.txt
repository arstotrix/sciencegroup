It is often thought that buildings are the face of a city. Thus, it is significant whether their appearance is attractive enough.On the one hand, it would be more useful for citizens to have an opportunity to buy a flat or a house with affordable price. Nowadays  there  areproblems on the real estate market, because the prices grow at a great rate and it becomes almost impossible to  control  the  cost  of  housing.That's why people, especially youth, are looking forward to get an accommodation with only basic  facilities.  Thus,  the  issue  the  building'sappearance plays  unimportant role.On the other hand, a city, which consists of numerous concrete boxes, looses his  appearance  at  all.  For  instance,  the  housing,  which  wasprovided in 1950s by N.S. Khrushchev. This type of accommodation was caused by the destroy after the World War II, because the  residents  neededthe places to live in. The blocks of flats were quickly built and convenient in use. However, when Russia's economic and social  development  hadbeen renewed, everyone noticed the unpleasant look of the buildings. Therefore, in recent years they are not found to be prestigious.To sum up, the appearance of the buildings in the city is like a visit card of the city and it  is  very  important  to  show  the  best  of  it.Besides, to my mind, the city should be divided into two parts. One would provide the housing with  acceptable  prices  and  plain  architecture,while another would deal with astonishing design and up-to-date technologies.
