  I have read three book reviews.First of all I wanted to say that for good review is very important the volume of text.It has to be not very long and at the same time not too short.
 Secondly, the review should  give the reader an informative summary,include a relevant description of the topic and the writer has to tell his own oppinion and his feelings about the book.
  As for me the first review was too long and  boring.Unfortunately,the author could not interest me in this book,so I would't read it.
  The second review was full of emotions.The author expresed his point of view and tried to cointerest the readers and to make us read  "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. 
 The best book review I consider the third one about "Three Men in a Boat" (to say nothing of the dog) by Jerome K. Jerome.It is very good structured.We can see the plot of the book and the main characters.We are totally immersed in the atmosphere of what is happening in the text,but at the same remains intrigue of what happens next.
