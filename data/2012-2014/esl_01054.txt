These days, there are a lot of possibilities to get education. So, formal education for children can begin at different  ages.  In some countries children start it earlier than seven or eight years old. Some people think that it is reasonable, but I don’t agree with them.
Firstly, at such an early age it can be difficult for children to do some things like waking up early mornings, sitting all the day and of course being without parents for a long time. It will influence on children’s psyche not the best way . In addition, lack of movement leads to diseases.
Secondly,  as far as I know, at the age of four  or five years child has a period of egocentrism.  During this time child is stubborn and conflict. And if there are a lot of such children in the class, it can lead to a bad atmosphere and failure to concentrate and study.
On the other hand, earlier we start studying and explore the world, more we know in the future. For instance, if we started learning some foreign language at the age of five, it is better than at ten, as we usually do it.  But I don’t think that children should study all the school subjects at the earlier age. Parents can enroll their child to  some club, for example, music club or English club, and it will be enough.
To sum up,  formal educational should start at seven or eight, but  informal can do it earlier.
