The topic of Fry's English Delight radio-program - gender and language - sounds really interesting, but for me it turned to be less fascinating than I expected. The first past is rather boring, it's devoted to one of the sociological problems in language. Women tend to feel discriminated when one uses the constructions with the word 'man' while speaking about both men and women. I understand English-speaking women who don't like that, but I can't sympathize them, because I use such constructions too as they're more laconic and familiar for me, and I don't feel it's unfair. It is pretty clear that when we say a phrase like 'everyone is responsible for his actions' we mean 'his or hers'. What's more, there are many idioms that  use 'he' or 'man' in the general meaning 'person' - and everything has always been fine with them for years. So, I think, this issue isn't worth spending so much time on: if women don't want to be dominated by men, they don't need to change the language, they can dominate in actions and success.
The second part of the program is a bit more informative. The guests talk about how the gender influences the way we speak and the words we say. They give good examples of the difference in men's and women's linguistic behavior. My favorite part is 'He says - he means, she says - she means', it's funny, but it's true. However, for me these facts and notes aren't anything new: men and women have different goals in a conversation, because they have different goals in life, that's why they speak about different things and in different manners.
On the whole, the discussion in this radio-program seems to be structural, well presented and sometimes funny, but not innovative or outstanding. And the conclusion, that Fry and his guest come to, makes all the previous talk useless. They agree that we don't really understand each other and this misunderstanding doesn't depend on the gender.
