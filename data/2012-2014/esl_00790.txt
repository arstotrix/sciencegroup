The exploration of space during the Cold War has become a battlefield for two countries, the USSR and the USA, in which they have been trying to do their best in order to win the competition and, in my opinion, nothing crucial has changed since that time. I agree that nowadays space exploration is still more connected with national pride than with international effort.
Having said that, I do realize that nowadays we there are much more international projects, aimed at space exploration, than we had in the past. I think, owing to the fact that the sphere of space research is very money- and time-consuming, and all governments of competitive countries understand that besides time and money,  they also need the best minds, the best ideas and a great common work in order to succeed in, for example, finding a life on distant stars. So that, sometimes it is possible for them to forget about their pride and gather the best people to work together for the sake of whole world. 
But, it is more an exception, not a rule. We still have this not a very nice tendency when the Russian Federation and the USA tries to beat each other successes in the exploration of space and win the race to conquer space. I suppose that this will continue and there is no sign of changes for the better. It is sad, but true â€“ while the space researches are so important and popular, developed countries, especially Russia and America, will still try to be the first to make a new big discover and win the Cold War that we still cannot disabuse from our mind.
