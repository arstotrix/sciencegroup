In this research I can see the diagram which shows  how do the different people prefer to relax.
There are three social groups: people born in Australia, new migrants from English-speaking countries and new migrants born in other countries.
Most people in all three groups prefer going to cinema or zoo to visiting places like theatres or libraries. I think that sociologists have made this research to realize how cultural interests depend on where did person live before becoming an Australian citizen.
Let's see these results based on  every  testing place.
The first place to visit is zoo. People are interested in Australia's nature and animals, because this country is very unusual.  
Secondly, we have library. Migrants want to read Australian books. People born in not English-speaking countries try to get education in Australia or they have to work here, and that's why they visit libraries often then people born in Australia or from English-speaking countries.
Why does theatre have so small percent of people visiting it? Maybe because  cinema is more popular and cheap . In addition, now most of films are in 3D, and it's really cool. That's why a lot of people love it.
