In the given flowchart is shown the process of manufacture. The path of the product from the selection of raw materials to its release on the counter. The chart is describing two different processes. The first one shows us manufacturing process, the  second one describes the process in which the product can be improved in early stages if something went wrong.

The path of goods starts with choosing the primary product. After accumulating all necessary materials, sets in production planning. Then follows product assembly, testing, selection and only by the end packing. Finally, the product comes to the buyer. Customer demand for goods is certainly dependent on advertisement and discounts.

To sum up, manufacturing process is a huge system and if something on defunct stage of the product goes wrong, for instance, using cheap materials or bad advertising, the product will not be competitive in the market. All the specialists have to work cohesively in order to achieve a decent result and to make happy not only themselves but customers too.
