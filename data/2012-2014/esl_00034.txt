More and more companies prefer to use the services of recruitment agencies. However, this hiring strategy is often inefficient. There are frequent errors in personal selection; in addition, the search of a suitable candidate is oftentimes time-consuming and costly. This paper hypothesizes that the success of the selection depends on the presence of a competence model for the position in the hiring company, which is sometimes lacking. In addition to this, even when the competence model is present, it may be misunderstood by the recruitment agency. This is also postulated as a contributing factor to the inefficiency in hiring. Thus, this study analyzes the correspondence between the model of competence and the view of the external recruiter on this model. In the first stage of this work, we review the existing research on this issue
Abstract
Recent analyses of organizational change suggest a growing concern with the tempo of change, understood as the characteristic rate, rhythm, or pattern of work or activity.
The current study of Karl E. Weick and Robert E.Quinn of Michigan business school of the University of Michigan aims to show the inevitability of the indigenous change in  approach to the theory of organizational changes, which presents the change as the inevitable and permanent organizational process.
The results of the study indicate that change is a natural response to the problems of adaptation to the environment, and consequently the change has neither a beginning nor it ever ends.  Large organizations need to realize that the process of change never stops, and to fully comply with the circumstances of the surrounding world. They need to use all of the coping mechanisms and to pay attention to those of its employees, which intelligently adjust to changing conditions in the company. Perpetual change should be part of the policy of companies.
