The different environment influence our life style and weight significantly. Therefore, it's interesting to look at the data of different generations and analyze them, find out the reasons why a decrease or an increase has happened. By comparing two chats one of which belongs to 1950 and another one - to 2010, we can see how the weight assessment of inhabitants of Newtown has changed. 
First of all, we can see that the number of people with underweight in 1950 in comparison to 2010 was extremely high among the youths, possibly because of the War and low income, but nowadays this difference is not so clear. The young people follow trends shown by models, especially those who are under 30. They started paying more attention to their body attending fitness clubs and taking everyday exercise, but the older generation prefers unhealthy lifestyle. This tendency is common for both of the chats. However, the number of people with ideal weight among all of the age groups in 2010 varied significantly while in 1950 the decline was gradual from 75% to 50%. And the amount of those who suffer from observe increases from the 20-29 age group to the 60-69 one in 2010, but stood nearly the same in 1950.  
The statistics show that the weight varies not only among the age groups, but also among the generations as the conditions of life are extremely different, that is why analyzing the weight assessment without knowing the specific features of age is impossible.
