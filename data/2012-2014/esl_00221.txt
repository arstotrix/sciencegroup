Every year different producers of autos invent new types of hybrid vehicles, which are really popular among people nowadays. The presented charts give us information on the sales of hybrid vehicles in the USA, in Japan and in the other world. It is easy to notice, that the main part of hybrids situates in the US.  The number of sales in 2006 on the territory of the United States was 250,000 vehicles, while in Japan and in the other world this number was just 50,000. A year later the level of sales in the USA reached a peak of 350,000 vehicles. In 2008 this quantity decreased by 80,000 and in 2009 the number of sales also decreased from 320,000 to 280,000. We can notice a very interesting index of sales in Japan. From 2006 till 2008 the numbers of sales were practically at the same level (increased from 50,000 to 90,000 hybrid vehicles). But in 2009 the market of hybrids detonated in Japan: the level of sales reached a peak of 350,000 vehicles and outran American's sales. Hybrid vehicles were not so popular in the other world, where the number of sales in 2007 was 70,000; in 2008 - 100,000 and in 2009 it reached the peak of 110,000 vehicles. 
An enormous jump of sales in Japan can amaze. But, in my opinion, this changes concerned with a total reorganization of Japanese heavy industry. The main aim of today's industry in Japan is to produce as much ecologically friendly vehicles as possible. The economic crisis in 2008 could cause sales recession in the USA, where the automobile industry suffered a lot.
