The charts show us information considering results of a survey about wildlife population taken from 2000 to present. The pie chart tells about the main reasons for different modifications in figures of wildlife population. While the diagram gives the percentage of changes in these figures.
According to the pie chart we can see that the most considerable changes in wildlife are caused by habitat destruction responsible for 43%. The second one is pollution - 21% and the third factor is overexploitation – 15%. Other reasons are disease, introduction of exotic species and random factors that are not so significant as others and make up in total 21%. 
The diagram gives the information about changes in animals’ population in percentage terms. Only few species have increased, bats and foxes together by 32% and otters by 9%, while the rest of representatives of wildlife have decreased. Insects have suffered most of all, then freshwater fish. Such species like birds, reptiles, part of mammals and aquatic mammals have decreased almost equally by no less than 10%. 
Summing up, it can be said that wildlife face the great force of a human-being. That is why the number of almost all animals represented in the diagram has fallen so rapidly in the last 13 years.
