The presented grath and chart give us information about species extinctions and about different factors which cause these extinctions. 

The grath shows us different results of extintions of plant and animal species in tropical forests and the expectations of future changes in the environment from 2000 to 2100.  In 2000 the extinctions reached the level lower than 10,000 species per decade. Nowadays, these results increaced, but the expectations show that this level will headily rise in the future. And the peak of extinctions will be in 2060. In 2060 the extinctions will reach the level of 10,000 species per decade. But after this year the number of extinctions will gradually go down.

The presented chart shows human and naturat threats to plant life. It is easy to notice that the human influance on extinctions of species is much bigger than natural. Only 18,7% of all threats belong to natural events while human impact 81,3%. And the most dangerous human's impact for the environment is agriculture.
