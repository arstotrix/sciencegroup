Maria Tsygunova, essay

Since the introduction of the Internet everyday routine has changed a lot as the World Wide Web has penetrated into many spheres of our lives, including the way we shop nowadays. The opportunities given by online shopping are truly remarkable. Still, there is always something in opposition, and this issue isn’t an exception.

To start with, many people perceive online shopping as convenience and this opinion cannot but be justified. First of all, this service saves time a lot. The reason is that one doesn’t have to go anywhere having anything they want in a click of a mouse, which is especially useful for the elderly. Moreover, online shops work 24/7 unlike regular ones. In addition, there is much on offer. One can buy anything from buttons or matches to technical equipment or even yachts through the Net.

However, a few disadvantages do exist. The most obvious drawback is that one can never be entirely sure about the quality of the purchase, especially when buying food products online. What is more, the likelihood of delivery delays can take place. Last but not least, one should never forget about the risk of paying online in credit card. Many people were unfortunate having faced fraud and hacking.

Taking everything into consideration, I would assume that although online shopping isn’t deprived of downfalls, it is still a convenient service. One not only has anything needed available, but also an opportunity to make cheaper purchases than in a local shop.
