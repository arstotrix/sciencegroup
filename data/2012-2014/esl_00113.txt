The flow state as an experience of self-transcendence
The phenomenon associated with the experience of the individual to go beyond his/her own borders, limits and his/her openness to the world has not yet been carefully investigated. Theories on this phenomenon vary across different psychological schools, and illuminate only some of its aspects. For example, in Positive psychology this phenomenon is regarded as the flow state (the concept proposed by M. Csikszentmihalyi, the mental state of concentration or complete absorption with the activity at hand and the situation) and in Existential psychology - as self-transcendence (according to V. Frankl it is rising above one's own self). So the purpose of this work is to prove that both concepts have the same empirical phenomenon in its base, and that there is a complex connection between them. Moreover, one of the hypotheses is that in some cases the flow state is a mechanism of self-transcendence. The empirical research will help to determine some specific characteristics of the flow state that lead to the emergence of self-transcendence experience.
