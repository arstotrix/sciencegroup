The interesting thing about me
I am a football fan. Maybe that fact isn't very surprising, but I have been interesting in football since 2003 and I think that it can define me.
I started to be keen on football at the age of 9, when I came for the first time in the sports group. I  wasn't an outstanding player, I just enjoyed the game. It taught me to work in team, I learned how to be responsible and to score a success despite all the hardship. To sum it up, football strengthened my character.
But later, football trainings began to prevent my studies, and I was obliged to put an end to the football.
Now I am rather ardent fan, than a player. My favorite team is Lokomotiv Moscow, I have been supporting it since 2004, when it won the Russian Premier League for the second time.
I regularly support my favorite team on the stadium. On the stands you can merge with the crowd, and come over as a part of a single whole. Sometimes distressing incidents happen: hooligans set the seats on fire, but the police arrest them quickly.
When I came of age I began to stake on the results of matches in the betting shop and even can earn a little money.
In conclusion, I d' like to say: it's rather difficult to tell something  about yourself, because everything  seems to you dull and ordinary. The most complicated problem is to decide, what can interest others.
