      Despite the abundance of linguistic research in the study of emotions in language, there are still unresolved issues concerning cross-linguistic conceptualization of emotions, namely, how emotions of the same type are conceptualized in different languages.
      The current study is a part of a big project "Emotions in different languages" that suggests creating a linguistic "map" of emotions in different languages and describing which subtypes the main emotions (e.g. fear, shame, pity etc.) have in each language. The particular paper is dedicated to examining the emotion pride in the German language.
      The methods of  this research are studying of the existing literature, which is related to emotions in a language, allocating of semantic features that distinguish subtypes of emotions and testing it by working with informants.
      The analysis proved that there are certain subtypes of pride in the German language, such as "legitimate pride", "unjustified pride" and "pompous pride". Moreover, the comparison with the Russian language was made and it was discovered that there are universal semantic trends and area of variation within a single type of emotions, as well as in the entire space of emotions. 
      The outcomes of this research can help us expand the concept of cross-language conceptualization of emotions and think of new semantic features for the analysis of words related to emotions.
