The table chart shows the places that are visited by different groups of people in Australia. The main comparison is made among people born in Australia, new migrants who were born in English-speaking countries or in other countries. In this research such places as zoo, library, theatre and cinema were taken into consideration.
     The most significant number of visitors is found in cinema: about 70% were born in Australia, 60% and 50% came from English-speaking and other countries, respectively. However, the lowest level of visiting has the theatre: near 25% are the migrants from English-speaking countries, 20% were born in Australia and 10% came from other countries.
     Besides, most of the people who were born in Australia prefer to go to the cinema rather than to the theatre. Among the new migrants born in English-speaking countries this correlation is also found. Instead, the distribution of new migrants from other countries differs from the previous: about 55% choose library.
     To sum up, this chart shows different attitude to time-spending of the residents of one country. On the example of Australia it was proved that new migrants are more likely to educate themselves by visiting library, however, people born in Australia look forward to entertaining by visiting cinema.
