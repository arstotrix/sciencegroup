There are a considerable number of corpora and online dictionaries nowadays, but an alternative to "The Frequency Grammar of Russian Language" does not exist. Such resource provides information about a frequency of grammatical inflective categories in Russian language. The creation of "The Frequency Grammar of Russian Language" is a new approach to investigate Russian language and extend linguistic knowledge. It may be highly valuable not only for theoretical linguists, but for common users, especially learners of Russian. 
The course paper focuses on the aim of creating a user-friendly interface of "The Frequency Grammar of Russian Language", made by means of new technologies of web-design and contemporary tools of corpus linguistics. The output of the work will be an experimental web-site in the Internet, which should contain an appropriate and extensive database, modern design and convenient search for users.
