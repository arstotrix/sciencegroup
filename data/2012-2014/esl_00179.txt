Some people think that animals can be used for the benefit of humans. Others think that animals should be protected.Nowadays it is popular to discuss the problems of  humanities. The most burning is issue has always been how we should treat animals.I agree that it is quite a sensitive question, but I believe that proper delimitation can help. I am not a vegetarian, however, I am stronglyagainst cruelty to animals. I think that as animals are being killed for our benefit the least people should is alleviate their suffering.   Icould probable survive being vegan, but for now I can also survive the thought that my food used to be alive not so long ago. However, I believethat it is very important that people who eat meat or use animals in some other way are always aware of the way they were brought to this form.Some people might say that people were eating, riding and using animals for hard work since ancient times, so we should not feel guilty forusing them today, but I believe that reconsideration of values is what males us better humans, so as we understood the value of human lives weshould start thinking about other living creatures. Everything that is easy to replace with more modern and humane materials is already beingreplaced, for example, less and less people wear fur.To sum up, I would like to say that although today people cannot totally stop using animals, that should be at least a tendency.
