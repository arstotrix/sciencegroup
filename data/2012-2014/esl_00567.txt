In the bar charts below we have figures of weight assessment for Newtown in 2010 and in 1950. Inhabitants are divided in five groups by age, from 20-29 years old to 60-69 years old. Basically, the graphs show percentage of weight qualities, called here as underweight, ideal, obese and overweight.
It's clear from the charts that in 1950 people were healthier and all groups have about 60% of those with ideal weight. The youngest group had 70%, next two had precisely 60%, the percents of the last two were a little over and just under 50%. As for 2010, the oldest group barely incounts 5%! Others show less distinct change: 70% among the youngsters, for the next three - just over 50%, 40% and equally over 40%. That means - the number of 'winners' with ideal weight are dropping.
The secong thing to note is that in 1950 people didn't eat enough. They were underweight: 30% of 20-29 years old, 20% of 30-39 years old, less than that for 40-49 group, a little more than that for 50-59 group and finally, 40% for 60-69 group. Thus, young people in 1950 were only welll-built or thin. The group of 30-39 years old has also 20% of overweight persons, and those were 20% of 40-49 group, 10% of 50-59 group and less than 10% of the oldest group. There almost weren't obese people.
In more present days, underweight inhabitants of Newtown, almost all of them, are 20% of the youngest group and 10% of the oldest group. It means, there is good market and no crisis, but there is also trend to be slim. The number of obese persons appears increasingly: 5%, 10%, 25%, 50% and 60%. Overweight persons are mostly 30-49 years old (35% each), also - 25% of 60-69 years old and 5% each for 20-29 group and 50-59 group.
