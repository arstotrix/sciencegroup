Describe the most valued possession you have or the one you know has
I think I cannot speak about the most valued possession my grandfather has, because he has several things which he prizes very much. But I can tell about one of them -- it is his stamp collection. He became interested in stamps about forty years ago. During this period, his interest became more sophisticated: for instance, now he knows very well which stamp is of great value and which is not. He told me a story about a stamp issued on the occasion of death of Lenin and showed two types of it: one type is rarer and therefore more valuable (he has both of them). Moreover, my grandfather draws dozens of new information from his collection. He reads a lot about the events and the persons pictured on his stamps and finds some mistakes in philatelic journals (sometimes he even writes to the editors). I am very glad of him that he has such a meaningful possession.
