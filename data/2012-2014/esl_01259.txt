What if I hadn`t met my best friend.

From my point of view, our way of life partly depends on our choice of people who will surround us every day. That is why I think that my life would have been another if I hadn`t been in the right place at the right time and hadn`t met a person who had become my best friend. School time was not an easy time for me, because I was very busy with my additional classes, musical school and loads of homework all the time. It is one of the reasons why I didn`t have many friends. All is simple. Nobody wants to have a friendship with a person who can meet twice a month. I was upset with the fact that I have nobody with whom I could discuss whatever and meet whenever.
One day I had nothing to do because it was summer holidays and I asked my classmate to go for a walk and that day I met my future best friend passing the street. I don`t know why but I had a great desire to know this person and I had a feeling that he will play a big role in my life. My classmate knows him and we were lucky to be introduced to each other. I can say that if I hadn`t met my best friend I wouldn`t have had such an interesting and understanding person. Sometimes I feel like he is my brother, we usually take care of each other and help each other with all the difficulties which happens to us . I cannot trust anyone as him. If we hadn`t known each other I would have continued spending my spare time sitting at home. And finally, I wouldn`t have had such a crazy first love with him after one year of our friendship.

In conclusion, I would like to say that accidents are not accidental. I believe in destiny and I think that all people who we meet play important roles in the life of each of us.
