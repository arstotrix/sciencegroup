Some people suppose that the coverage of sport leads to less popularity of doing it. Other people think that it encourages people to choose sportspeople as role-models and do sports themselves. 
As far as I am concerned, nowadays sport and healthy life-style mainstream. The coverage of sport and the popularity of sports celebrities encourage this process. From the very childhood we are surrounded by advertisements and banners with famous sportspeople who  become our role-models. Now a lot of new sportspeople say that they decided to devote their lives to sport inspired by sports legends.  Moreover, coverage of sport helps us to follow all the major competitions and to be into sport, and if you  are fond of sport, you are eager to do it yourself. More than that, the increased popularity of worldwide sport competitions is instrumental in sport infrastructure development. For example, lots of professional football fields built  in Russia due to the forthcoming World Cup in 2018. 
There is one more point of view – some people guess that the highly increased coverage of sport makes it a business and leads to a decrease in popularity of doing it and nowadays you can enjoy sport just sitting in front of your TV-set. I cannot agree with this statement. As I guess, here are not so many people who haven’t ever //have never tried to do their favorite sportOnly if you know how hard it is to become a professional sportsman you can be a real sports fan.
To sum up, I would like to say that sport coverage makes healthy life-style more popular, improves sport infrastructure and provides right role-models for future generations. In spite of the fact that sport is becoming a business, it still can unite people.
