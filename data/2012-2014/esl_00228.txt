Nowadays sport is not just a competition. It is a complex event which is based mainly on money. It can be called even a business but not purely sport. Therefore, a lot of people become more and more unsatisfied by this fact.
The thing is that people get money from sport in different ways. On the one hand, there are those who bet on wining of some powerful team or sportsman. They are quite different from fans, on the other hand, who pay sometimes considerable amount of money but really enjoy competition, being involved in the specific atmosphere of sport and cheering for their favorite team. However other people cheer for one team only for profit, they just want to get more money for themselves and not pleasure of sport competition. Therefore, in general, they are not interested in sport industry. Another problem is that only strong and promising teams and sportsmen are involved into sport. The thing is that people want to make more money using sportsmen's stability and power. In result, other sportsmen who maybe not so budding and strong but ready to work hard and achieve results are not demanded in sport. It is normal when sportsmen earn money doing their best, but when the money is given to those who just predict the winner - it is strange and unfair, in my opinion. The money now is everywhere in sport and it is normal because fans should pay for the pleasure they get and sportsmen earn for their work. 
In conclusion, I think that sport becomes business in some way because nowadays a lot of popular industries become based on money and sport is not an exception. But the thing is that the money should be earned fairly.
