Nowadays more and more poeople call shopping their hobby. So why it is such a trend modern?
I think that one of the reason of shopping becoming a hobby is that in our  era of globaliziation a huge number of different gods is now available for people from all parts of the world, that was impossible decades ago. After World War II the world economics had become much stronger and people had started earning money again. With customers having money the advertisment industry started developing. In fact, ads help people spend money. 
Earlier in the past people were offered only useful goods, but now we can see that the market is overload with lots of cheap things that customers are forced to buy. Businessmen work today only for making profit but not for making a customer glad with a good quality of a thing. Business does not care about people any more. Nobody will deny, if I say that humanity lives much better in 2014 than in the 20th century. So, all in all, I think shopping at some point is a positive development of economics and humanity itself. Without such an obsession of spending money the number of working places would be reducing dramatically.
Another thing that I should admit is that shopping itself are not so bad, because with time passed not only the amount of producing and quality change. In the 21st century techologies develop very rapidly so the new type of gods has been created, such things like mobile phones, cameras, laptops, etc.
Summing up, I would like to attract attention to major reasons of shopping being a positive trend. From my point of view, they are development of economics, creating new working places and inventing completely nes kinds of goods.
