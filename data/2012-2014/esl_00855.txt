Shopping was a routine domestic task in the past times, but nowadays many people consider it as a hobby. Is it positive trend or it is a thing we should rethink? 
I think, it is more positive trend than negative one as people adapt to the situation of life nowadays. It means that if all people concern shopping as a routine domestic task, they will not realize the environment and the people around. They do it as fast as they can to get home back to their casual life. Although it is not too bad, shopping as hobby has its advantages. For example, it can diversify our life, which is already can be full of routine tasks. Moreover, those who are keen on shopping can better understand which goods are qualitative and which are not. 
On the other hand, shopping as the hobby can make bad effect on us. For example, people who became shopaholic spend much more money on things they need to. They can be easily captured by sales, and then they will spend all money they have. Also their behavior to things can be overpowered, so people who are keen on shopping may hurt someone feelings just because of the thing, if somebody say that it was not worth to buy.
To draw the conclusion, one can say that shopping as a hobby sometimes can be useful as it vary our livesâ€™ routine, but all of those who are keen on it should be careful, because they can lose all their money and friends. So it is up to everybody to decide whether they like shopping or not.
