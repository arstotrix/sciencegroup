The interesting thing about me.
 I want to tell you about the achievements in sport.
  When I studied in a German linguistic gymnasium, we often held competitions between classes in volleyball, ping-pong, basketball and football. We always looked forward their beginnings. For the first place active fight was conducted.To be the first, it's necessary to prepare well and constantly to train.I was the captain of team of girls of a class on volleyball. My team was in time and well to train and study. Our trainings were rest from study. During game we should not only solve strategy of the opponent, but also understand each other on a look, be able to think of the actions and actions of the partner 
in team. Only cooperating it was with each other possible to achieve success. My volleyball team always took first places within the walls of a gymnasium.
  As it would be desirable to tell separately about competitions on mini-football. Our girls team played with school from Dusseldorf. In team I was the smallest and on age,and on growth. Therefore my name fans shouted more often. It seemed to me that I - the center of all events in the field. Fortunately then our team won and us awarded with prizes.
On a game field we met German girls for the first time but after that all of us became friends and began to communicate on the Internet. As in our gymnasium often children went on an exchange to Germany, we could meet and spend together time. We walked across Moscow, and they acquainted us with the culture.
These events are unforgettable a impressions on all life! All of us such different were united by sports!
