The table shows us how many students studied at Bristol University in 1928, 1958 and 2008.
It is clear that there was an upward trend in the number of new enrolled students. In 1928 it was 218 people and in 1958 and 2008 it was 1,046 and 6,377 people respectively. Although in 1958 the amount of female students fell by 10% in comparison to 1928, in 2008 this number reached a peak with 54%. Contraversely, in 1958 percentage of male students rose from 58 to 68, but in 2008 it fell to 46. In 1928 there were 50% of people who came from close areas, but in 1958 there was a sharp fall and there were only 14% then, while in 2008 there was very small number of people who came from within 30 miles to Bristol. However, despite the fact that in 1928 and 1958 there were not so many people from abroad (5% and 6% respectively) in 2008 28% of all student came from overseas. In addition, the number of countries also rose from 3 to 98 in the examined years.
   Overall, with the rise of a total number of students, more people started coming from abroad in 1958 and 2008, but there were almost no people from close areas these years. In 1928 and 1958 there were more female than male students, while in 2008 the situation was quite on the contrary.
