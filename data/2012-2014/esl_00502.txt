Dear Sally,
Hi, how's it going? Hope everything's fine. I haven't seen you for ages, it was great to hear from you.
By the way, you told me that you're coming to my country. Great news, bro! However, I actually think that you need some tips about dealing with culture shock. First of all, we don't differ much from you, you ain't coming to China or whatever, better always remember that. Russians are not far from Englishmen, especially youngsters, whom you'll be mostly in touch with. Probably these are the main things that, when remembered, will help you to deal with culture shock. Oh, and you always have Facebook and stuff like that to communicate with those who are far away. You ain't flying to another planet, everything's gonna be all right. It'll probably be hard the first days, but it's me who will support you and stuff. Then you'll make other friends and once you will realize that in here it's as good as at your place. 
Don't ever worry about culture shock. Have a nice weekend.
