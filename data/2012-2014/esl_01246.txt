    Nowadays there are a lot of shops, supermarkets and shopping centers in every city. Some people are fond of spending their free time there, while others prefer shopping on the Internet.
   In my opinion, doing online shopping is easier than doing shopping in the malls. First of all, it saves your time. You should not go the city center or even go the another city to do shopping. All you need is a computer with the Internet where you can purchase something that you like in a second. Another advantage of the online shopping is that you can buy every product you want, from food to cars. It often happens that we can not find an appropriate product in the city shops, however, if we look for it online we will find out that there are many types of the product from different countries. In addition, the price for the goods in the Internet shops is lower than in the shopping centers because web-sellers should not pay for the rent for offering the goods, meanwhile the shop managers do pay.
  However, some people refuse to purchasing anything in the online shops. There are some reasons. The most important reason is that people do not feel themselves secure with making online pavements. Customers do not trust sellers and they are afraid of being cheated by the foreigners from the web. Another drawback to the online shopping is that we are unable to estimate the condition of the product because we have only pictures of this. Besides, sometimes the pictures do not match the appearance in real life.
   To sum up, although the online shopping is not the safest way of purchasing the goods, it is indisputably the most comfortable method of shopping. Every day new customers make their first orders on the Internet. I have no doubts that the number of people doing online shopping will increase.
