The charts give the data about animate nature in tropical forests from 2000 to 2100. The line chart provides the information about the changes in the number of endangered plant and animal species in the period under the view, while the pie chart illustrates the primary reasons why plants are extinct.
At a first glance, more than 80 % of all factors that jeopardize the plant life are human activity.  A considerable part of this percentage falls on farming (e.g., agriculture (18.7%), harvesting (14.4%) and plantations (4.7%)). Other activities, such as logging (9.7%), development (10.4%) and livestock (7.7%) also pose a threat. In addition, invasive species and  disturbance affect endangered plants in a small number. Natural events, in their turn, have a smaller impact on plant lives. For instance, natural disasters and other natural events make up  7% and 11.7 % of the entire amount respectively.
All the factors mentioned above affect considerably the number of plant and animal species. While the number of the extinctions in every million species was approximately 5. 000 in 2000. This figure is predicted to soar in 5 times from 2020 to 2060 and to reach a peak with 50 million in 2060. However, between 2060 and 2100 there will be a marked fall in the amount of extinct creatures.
Overall, there is a plenty of different factors that pose a threat to endangered plants. However, according to predictions, the threat of extinction will decrease in the second half of the 21st century.
