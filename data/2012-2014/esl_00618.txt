The graph and chart compare information about species extinctions and the threats to plant life.
Corresponding to the century timeline of extinctions the most massive extinctions took place in the end of the third decade.  On the other hand, the 2000 had by far the lowest  figures. Timeline of extinctions shows that at the beginning of the one hundred year period about 5,000 extinctions took place. By the end of the third decade, however the number of species extinctions had seen significant changes, it had risen by just over a 45, 000. Between the 2060 and 2100 the number had been  steadily decreasing. 
It is clear that the biggest threat to the plants place among all types of menaces is the agriculture. By contrast, the plantations recorded by far the lowest figures. Natural disasters has the lowest figures among the natural events reaching just under 7%. This is more than 10% less than the largest figures among the human impact - 18.7% for agriculture.
