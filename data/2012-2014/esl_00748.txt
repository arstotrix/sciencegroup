Graffiti is ancient phenomenon as all the scratched drawings found on the walls of the caves and on the gravestones in Ancient Greece are usually called so. The characteristics of the modern graffiti did not change much. However, attitude of the society to the contemporary type of graffiti differs a lot from those that people express towards the ancient one.

On the one hand, graffiti today is not only a way of expressing oneself but usually damaging some private property what is illegal. Moreover, everyone has their own sense of beauty and since graffiti are primarily associated with ill-being and poverty common reaction to graffiti is negative. Eventually, graffiti could be dangerous to the government ideology as in general that way of expressing points of view cannot be censored, is located in public places where crowds of people can see it and the artists who create this type of artworks are as a rule radically disposed. 

On the other hand, all the arguments stated above can be interpreted as features of real piece of art. For example, graffiti can make from dull, undistinguished wall or fence something that deserves attention or something that awakes emotions. What is more, spray paints used for “spoiling” the walls are not very cheap. Additionally, real art cannot be censored and has to imply some sort of idea.

In conclusion it has to be said that graffiti since it is not an elitist type of art could never stand in the same line as work of Renoir or Michelangelo, although they do not deserve the status of vandalism because it requires human effort whereas vandalism is a way of delivering from excess energy.
