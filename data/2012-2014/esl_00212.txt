We all know an old aphorism "my house is my castle" and there is no wonder that people want to find a comfortable and safe place to live in.However, people differ in opinion on what is the most essential characteristic of their dream-house. While some people think that it is moreimportant to build cheap houses and facilities, others believe that buildings which city provides for them should be in the first place well-designed and beautiful.The main point of those, who are for the cheap houses, is that many people nowadays have no home at all and even more people do not have enoughmoney to buy a well-designed and decorated house. But these people also need to have a 'castle' in which they can hide from all their problems,so it might be reasonable to provide some cheap buildings for them. And then their owners will decorate the house from the inside and fill itwith good memories so it will become the most beautiful place for them.Nevertheless, the beauty of the city buildings is very important too. Nowadays we admire the buildings from the 18th and 19th centuries, we findthem very gorgeous and impressive, but what will the future generation get from us? Identical one-color houses-boxes? Surely, the governmentshould be concerned about some architectural heritage which the next generation might be proud of. However, it will be wiser to build beautifultheatres, libraries, sport centers and other facilities than apartment houses. All in all, the beauty of the flat is inside it, but a facilityin order to get peoples' attention should look spectacular outside too.All in all, it is important to keep the balance between the cheap houses and well-designed buildings. The government certainly should not spendall the money on beautiful houses when there are so many homeless on the streets but it is possible to build new magnificent recreational,educational or athletic facilities.
