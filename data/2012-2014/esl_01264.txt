What if I hadn’t moved to Moscow? I ask myself about it every day before going to sleep. I have a lot of thoughts and a lot of answers for this question. In my mind the negative sides are replacing on the positive ones and I understand that everything has it’s pros and cons.  

On the one hand, if I hadn’t moved to Moscow, I would have still lived with my family in Krasnodar. Certainly, I would have seen my parents, my little sister and my friends every day. Of course, it is a very big advantage of not moving so far away from him. But also, I would have walked around the city, in which I already know every alleyway; I would have studied in the local university not at Linguistics Department. I don’t think that it’s a good perspective but I don’t know only one thing – how I would have thought about it if I hadn’t moved to Moscow. 

On the other hand, I would have lost pretty much if I hadn’t moved to the capital of Russia. I wouldn’t be able to enjoy every day the beauty of Moscow and it’s grandeur. I would never have known the rhythm and style of life of the metropolis; I would never have found my new friends from Moscow. There is no doubt that I would not have started my adult and independent life so early. And it is needless to say that my life would have been very empty and meaningless without my favorite boy, who has been near to me all that time since the first day of my life in Moscow. And I appreciate the fact that he had waiting for me here for a very long time while we had been living far away from each other.  

Many of these things I realize only right now, after a year living in Moscow. I’m sure it was an important decision and I did it right. I can many speculate about what if I hadn’t moved to Moscow. But it’s done, and all that is done is done for better.
