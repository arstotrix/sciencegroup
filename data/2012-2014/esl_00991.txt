Men are more interested in sport than women.
A lot of people believe that men are interested in sports more than women. In my mind, it is true because if you look at the fans of any sport you can see that there are more men than women.
First of all, the passion to compete has been laid in the person of the male sex from time immemorial. It so happened that in the animal world the male is constantly fighting with his rivals: the struggle for the female, for territory, for the status of the leader, etc. Similarly, it is among the people: the man is a great pleasure to see how someone fights with competitors for the award.
Secondly, sport allows a man to  express their feelings and emotions openly. From childhood boys are taught that real men must be restrained in expression of feelings. Sport gives men the opportunity to express their emotions without fear of public censure or condemnation. When male fans or players on the field hug and kiss from the joy of victory it is normal. But if you see that the two men are hugging and kissing on the street , for sure you will think that they are gay guys. 
So sport is one of the few areas where men are allowed to express their emotions. Indeed, in daily life they often can not do it.
