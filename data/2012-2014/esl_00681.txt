In this report I will describe a bar chart which shows the number of minutes of telephone calls in the UK from 1995-2002.
There are three call types represented on the chart, and I am going to look at each of them. As can be seen from the graph, the total number of minutes of mobile calls dramatically increased in nearly 40 billions from 1995. National and international calls required approximately 36 billion minutes in 1995, and the amount rose to 60 billion minutes in 2002.
Finally, there is no difference in the total number of minutes of local telephone calls in the UK in 1995 and in 2002. However, there is a growth in 20 billions in 1995-1999. In 1999 the amount reaches the peak in 90 billion minutes. Then there is a decline in 20 billions as well.
To sum up, I can say that the total number of minutes of the two call types, mobile and national and international, increased in 1995-2002. At the same time, the amount of time of local calls stayed the same, but the was an increase in 1995-1999 and a decrease in 1999-2002.
