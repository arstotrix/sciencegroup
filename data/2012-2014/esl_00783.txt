These days, information technology has developed so much that we can do a lot of things being far away from home. What this development enables is working outside someoneâ€™s workplace. As all the tendencies it has its advantages and disadvantages, but the benefits undoubtedly prevail.
One of the objections might be that this mobility causes the overwork. Some people decide business issues all the time during their holidays or at home after the work day. On the other hand, in our modern world instant decision making is a key to the success. What helps business people to keep the track of events is options that distance work provide. For instance, many administrators and managers can check what is going on at the office or interact with their business partners during the work trip.
Of course, to work well people need socialization, which distance work struggles with. At the same time, this mobility is irreplaceable problem solution for the people who are not able to work in offices due to different reasons. In addition, they can communicate with their colleagues in social networks. For example, mothers who have small children and cannot leave them at home alone have an opportunity to work distantly and take care of their families. Further example is presented by disabled people, who undergo difficulties moving from one place to another, and they can easily earn a living by using new innovations in technology.
Overall, the pluses of the mobility in work that information technology enables outweigh the minuses. Moreover, it allows more progress in business to be made and more labor power to be engaged.
