   Some people think that more important that cities provide cheap houses and facilities while others think it is worth spending money on well-                                                     designed buildings that look beautiful.The majority of people believe that living in city full of architectural masterpieces is important and consider spending money on the outwardappearance of their hometown necessary while others think such expense to be pointless and wasteful as they would rather get cheap livingconditions than satisfied sense of beauty. Who is right?On the one hand, beautiful surroundings delight our sense of beauty and cultivate taste. Furthermore, money spent on the appearance of buildingsmight bring substantial income from the tourism. But on the other hand, investing in the aspect of the city will undoubtedly heighten the rentand price of the municipal services. Such state of affairs is acceptable only in cities where living standard is rather high.From my point of view, living conditions are much more important than beautiful appearance as our health and wellbeing depend on how warm andlight our flats are but not on how our houses look like. The comfort of the dwelling should be on the first place whereas the outfit is anoption.
