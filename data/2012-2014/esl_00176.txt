Some people think that animals can be used for benefits of humans; others though think that animals should be protected.This issue is definitely one of the most arguable nowadays. Quite possible, that the root of a  problem  is  in  the  questions  like  "What  areanimals for?" or "What role do they play in the natural processes?".On the one hand, there is a camp of people that maintains the equality of all living creatures all over  the  world.  Indeed,  the  promotion  ofkindness behavior and harmless attitude to the environment is the thing which is lacking today. By saving the diversity of  animal  types  peoplesave the most complicated biosphere system. This point is quite important, because each of these types is responsible for the keeping balance  ofa wild nature.What is keeping the balance? Everybody knows that the biosphere itself contains a huge variety of  organisms  and  microorganisms  which  somehowaffect the natural processes. For instance, food chain that  is  very  important  because  of  its  significant  part  in  the  biological  cycle(круговорот веществ в природе?).On the other hand, there is domesticated area of nature, so-called "farm industry". Animals equally with plants are still cautiously selected  inorder to hold another balance - balance in human nature. People are always faced with  problems  concerning  survival,  thus,  animals  would  beconsidered to be a great source of meat, fur and other items for everyday needs.So, there are two different sides of animals' life to distinguish: 1) wild nature; 2) domesticated  area.  Concerning  this  differentiation  twodifferent balances are found respectively. If the mankind deals with only the second type without any encroachment on  the  first,  it  would  bevery successful scheme. However, nowadays hardly any hunter ever thought it over.
