In-group preferences emerge relatively early in childhood. Research on ethnicity and gender consider that by the age of 3 or 4 years children normally express more positive attitudes towards their own group than towards others. Some studies have even shown in-group favouritism in minimal or transitory groups at around 5 years of age. Cognitive-developmental theory is the most well-known account of how intergroup attitudes develop in childhood. This theory contends that only with cognitive development do children stop defaulting to the use of social categorization and consequently show a reduction in intergroup discrimination. When children move away from the 'sociocentric' stage of development their perceptions cease to focus only on group differences, and they become capable of making social judgments also on the basis of unique interpersonal characteristics of an individual. Therefore, cognitive-developmental theory predicts that, as children get older and increase in cognitive maturity, the availability of information about individuals' characteristics should dominate perception, and thereby help to reduce intergroup biases.
