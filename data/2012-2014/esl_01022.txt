Nowadays internet becomes a huge part of people's lives. They spend their time and money there, posting pictures and writing blogs. But why it is so popular? At first, because of its availability. Everyone could share his or her own thoughts with the whole world if he or she will have access to the internet. 
Second point is that everyone could share his or her up-to-the-minute feeling. However because of this lots of blogs are flooded with useless information.
On the other hand, there are plenty of talented people who share out their ideas with. There are some examples when blogs were published and blogger become very popular.
Personally I read blogs very often but I think that some of them are really worth reading. It's not only way to spend your time in the internet but you can find like-minded person and read discussion about nowadays problems which you can't find in books. So if you want to read blogs I'd recommend to find them properly to avoid facing junk read.
