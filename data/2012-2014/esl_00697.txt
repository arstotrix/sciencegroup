Nowadays the unpaid community service is an obligatory part of programmes in many schools. However, some people think that it should be removed from the schools' crriculum or at least be optional. I would rather disagree with this point of view.
Firstly, high school students are almost adults. they need to get an experience. These activities may help them to understand who they want to become in the future. Furthermore, students may learn how to communicate with other people and get the social skills they will need at work.
Secondly, such activities as improving the neighbourhood or teaching children are very important for the local commnities. Involving high school students may raise their attention to the problems the community is faced to. for example, cleaning the streets will make students put their trash into the trash beans and respect the cleaners.
however, one might say that school students should be paid for doing such job. Personally, I think that they indeed should be paid, but only if they did their job properly. Unfortunately, it is hard to find a set of criteria for the evaluation of results. Therefore, I suppose that it is better to leave this work unpaid. Moreover, this solution will save some money which can be spent on developing the school education system and building computer classrooms or digital libraries.
To sum up, I think that unpaid community service should remain compulsory or the local community itself should decide whether it is appropriate or not.
