If I were to give a course of creative writing to school students coming to School of Young Philologist classes, I would ask them to read a lot of classical and modern literature and to have their own opinion on each book. It would be great if we could discuss some interesting literary works. Also, I would tell them not to be afraid of any words and ideas, any metaphors and similes they want to write.  And I would make discussions not only on literature they have read, but on their own writings too.
