According to the chart given, a duration of all telephone calls in the UK was constantly growing from 1995 to 2002. It was increased by more then five dozens of billion minutes. This chart also indicates that fixed line usage for local calls was growing since 1995 till 1999, where it reached a peak and started to fall. In spite of constant changes, a duration of local fixed line calls had never fallen below 70 billion minutes yet. The chart shows that total number of minutes of national and international telephone calls in the UK is raising slowly but inevitably. Although mobile calls maintaned the last position during this seven years, they showed us the most impressive changes. Since 1999 till 2001 they soared from 13 to 39 billion minutes, tripling their amount. This speed of growth allows us to suspect that theirs would gain the leading positions in the future.
