The features of Innovative Thinking: The analysis of main stages of innovative process.
Innovation is the creation of better or more effective products, processes, or ideas that are accepted by markets, governments, and society. Nowadays, innovations permeate all areas of social and economic life and become an indicator of organizational effectiveness and its competitive advantage. However, for an organization the main value is not the innovation, but people who create it. A distinctive feature of such  employee is an innovative way of thinking that develops through immersion into the innovation process during its main stages: a) idea generation, b) idea promotion, c) idea implementation. 
Innovative thinking is a relatively new notion in psychology and, as such, it is not yet sufficiently defined and understood. In particular, it is frequently confused with the more traditional notion of creative thinking. In order to distinguish creative and innovative thinking, it is necessary to conduct an experimental research to examine the features of the innovative thinking. In order to do so, the main stages of innovative process are to be analyzed.
