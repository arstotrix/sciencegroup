The table provides information about Bristol University student enrolments in three time peiods - in 1928, 30 years later and the last one - in 2008. 
At the first sign we may see that the quantity of new students enrolled at Bristol University was increasingly rising from 218 in 1928 to 1046 in the late sixties and about three times more than in the latter mentioned - about 6400 in the year 2008. The same situation could be seen with the percentage of students that came overseas which has risen from 5-6% in mentioned periods of the XX century up to just about 30 per cent in 2008. However, it is noteworthy that the quantity of students that came from within 30 miles of Bristol has fallen from 50 to 2 per cent. As for the percentage index for male and female students, it had been constant for each group in each period.
As we may conclude, with rising the quantity of students enrolled there is not only increasing of overseas enrolments but also falling down the quantity of enrolled students form places near Bristol University. So, as we may conclude, the University of Bristol eventually became more popular with overseas student enrolments than with local ones.
