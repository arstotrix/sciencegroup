#31	AnnotatorNotes T41	this sentence is unnecessary, try to incorporate this idea into the next sentence, e.g.: Egocentric languages use the self as a point of reference for describing the relative location of objects. Unlike this, geographic languages, such as G Y, use cardinal directions as an absolute point of reference.
