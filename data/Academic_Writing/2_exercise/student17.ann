#3	AnnotatorNotes T3	Such a system (?)
T2	note_reviewer_1 3402 3410	It seems
#2	AnnotatorNotes T2	"It seems" is not very persuasive, moreover it is obvious that the author did not try to present his own data in the article. It was designed as an overview/

T7	note_reviewer_1 2755 2806	s the notion of typologically rare language systems
#7	AnnotatorNotes T7	Deutscher did not write about typologically rare languages, he simply provided examples from Guugu Yimithirr and the one with  evidentiality. This means that  he did not  elaborate on the notion  of typologically rare languages.
