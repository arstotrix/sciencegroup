Deutscher, G.  (2010). Does Your Language Shape How You Think? Horacio Salinas for The New York Times, 26, August. 
Linguists have been concerned with studying the way language impacts an individual’s mind functions for a long time. A set of studies were produced to find out the main influences. In 1940 In 1940 Benjamin Lee Whorf stated that different language speakers conceptualize and experience the world in different ways. In spite of the fact that, an American linguist and fire prevention engineer made a lot of mistakes in formulating of this statement, the whole generation was forced to agree with him. However, some investigations by other linguists still continue nowadays. 
In the article Does Your Language Shape How You Think?, Deutscher explores different facts of language influence on the way people think. The author starts with the Whorf’s theory and contends that he didn’t have any facts to confirm it. Thus, Deutscher says that the theory is wrong on many levels and then wrecks it with the simple evidence. In the rest of the paper, he primary grounds why he thinks that our languages do not ‘constrain our minds and prevents us from being able to think certain thoughts’, rather, they influence us to think about certain concepts that have been suggested in our minds.  
As to drawbacks of the article, there is a lack of conclusion. The article ends with the brief philosophic paragraph, which does not differ from others. In the last sentences of the work it is expected to see a statement, which brings all the facts to conclusion. The author gives us a very good work, however it looks incomplete.
Finally, the writer has provided many interesting examples and references to justify his point of view. The article is very engaging to acquaint with, a reader can value differences between languages in full measure. Deutscher’s arguments are strong and authoritative.
