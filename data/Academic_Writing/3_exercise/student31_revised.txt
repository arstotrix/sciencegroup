The article in the magazine "Corpora" presents a work by Antti Arppe, Gaëtanelle Gilquin, Dylan Glynn, Martin Hilpert, and Arne Zeschel which is called “Cognitive Corpus Linguistics: five points of debate on current theory and methodology”.
This work consists of a discussion in which these people introduce their opinions about whether corpus methods should or should not be used in cognitive linguistic.
The name of the magazine makes it clear that the article is supposed to be read by people interested in or at least somewhat familiar with this problem.

The structure of the article is organised in such a way that all the five point of views are clearly designated as they are represented in the form of a dialogue.
One reason for such representation can be the authors' desire to show the readers pros and cons of each opinion and therefore to let them subscribe to a particular point of view or if the opposite come to their own conclusion.
Leaving aside the advantage of dialogical way of telling the ideas, the dialogues themselves not always appear to be fully understandable as each speech is really long and needs some kind of appropriate knowledge.

As this article is suggested to be read by people close to corpus methods it is full of various terms near the point of corpus linguistic.
However there are some attempts to introduce cognitive linguistic expressions.
In view of abundance of special terms and few examples it may seem tough to touch the ground of the article.

It is hard to say if the authors have achieved their aim to create a full picture of the "corpus&cognitive" problem , but perhaps their article can make somebody interested in this question and to inspire people to go into the question.
Still, some simple retelling of the people's ideas instead of publishing such long pieces of their speech and adding a few more definitions (or just explaining in a more "human" language) would not be redundant.
