People usually think of tongue-twisters as of something that children do for fun competing with each other, and much more rarely tongue-twisters can be interpreted as a way of developing articulation and pronunciation.
I believe that it is possible to introduce lessons or at least some trainings of tongue-twisters into practice in kindergartens, primary schools and maybe even high schools.
After all nowadays a lot of children and teenagers have problems with enunciation, and this practice of tongue-twisters may help them to develop their speech or probably get rid of all their speech defects
