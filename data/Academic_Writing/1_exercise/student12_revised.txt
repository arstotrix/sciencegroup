When learning a foreign language it is crucial for a student to develop proper and fluent speech. However, it is a complicated task for a teacher to teach a child to pronounce all the sounds correctly. Tongue twisters can become an easy and funny way to do it. They contain sound clusters that are challenging to pronounce. As a primary school student faces this challenge, he/she tries to pronounce tongue twisters again and again, makes mistakes, corrects them and thus improves his/her pronunciation. Very soon the student's speech becomes more clear without making him/her bored. This is why tongue twisters should be included into the language programs of primary schools.
