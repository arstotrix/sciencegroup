Native language education is considered to be important in primary school and focuses mainly on improvement of writing and reading skills. Development of correct and clear speech often stays out of school program, although many children have problems with articulation. Learning tongue-twisters could solve these problems. Tongue-twisters are a perfect and simple method of teaching how to articulate sound. They also demonstrate how important it is to differentiate sounds, showing that an improperly pronounced sound can change the whole meaning of a phrase. Tongue-twisters would help children, improve their speech and develop their linguistic intuition and imagination.
