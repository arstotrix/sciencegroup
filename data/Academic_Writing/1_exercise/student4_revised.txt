Usually tongue-twisters increase the opportunity of a child to be able to improve his or her ability to pronounce specific sounds. Since some children might not be able to pronounce sounds like “r”, there is a range of tongue-twisters that are based on the “r” sound, so when a child keeps practising saying it out loud, there is a possibility that he or she might improve their pronunciation.
