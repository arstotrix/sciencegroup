The inclusion of tongue-twisters in primary schools’ curriculum seems to be a good idea. 
Obviously, it is easier to obtain a skill regardless of its type in the childhood than to retrain being an adult. Moreover, improper diction may result in spelling mistakes in writing performance, as children’s writing is phonetic-based. Thus, it is important to teach children to speak correctly as early as it is possible. Furthermore, many children find tongue-twisters fun, which makes it a great replacement of the dreary repetition of sounds.
To conclude, tongue-twisters are indeed useful and are likely to be included into the language programs of primary schools.
