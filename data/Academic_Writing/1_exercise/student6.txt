Tongue-twister is a phrase that is designed to be difficult to articulate properly, and can be used as a type of spoken word game. Some tongue-twisters produce results which are humorous when they are mispronounced.
However, currently, tongue-twisters are an optional part of the curriculum, they are used if the child has problems with the pronunciation of certain sounds or sound combinations.
Although, they are the main speech exercises to achieve the purity and clarity of pronunciation, emphasis of diction and increase the rate of speech. Tongue twisters help your child well and quickly learn to speak their native language. What is not so bad reason for the mandatory inclusion of twisters in the primary curriculum.
