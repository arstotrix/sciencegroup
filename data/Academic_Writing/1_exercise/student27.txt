Nowadays there are some debates about wether tongue-twisters should be included into the language programs of primary schools or not. From a linguistic point of view, tongue-twisters seem to be important as a useful pronunciation practice. Reading tongue-twisters by kids can help them in learning how to pronounce certain phonemes properly. For example, with a little help of tongue twisters, a kid can easily learn what are the difference between «sh» and «s» sounds in some words and how to use them and where. Therefore, tongue-twisters can make kid’s speech better and improve her language.
