Including tongue-twisters into the language programs of primary schools can be very useful as it helps to refine the methodology in several ways. Apparently, tongue-twisters can improve one's articulation and speech rate. If children learn to speak legibly in the early age, they won't need to go to the therapist in the future. Moreover, people who speak fluently are more likely to have fewer problems with their written language. But this is not the only advantage of using tongue-twisters. They also bring fun to the class and help the teacher to hold children's attention. Therefore, this interesting form of folklore not only improves students' language abilities, but also makes the lesson more interesting and exciting as children laugh at each other's mistakes and learn through them.
