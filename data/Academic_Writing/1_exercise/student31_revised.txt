When a child is to go to school it is supposed that he/she should speak correctly. Not all children have to deal with a logopaedist in preschool time on an obligatory basis, but still they might have some speech defects. And here comes the school strategy of practicing tongue-twisters, which are great in the way of developing one's vocal apparatus. The pronunciation and articulation get clearer, more eloquent. 
A child learns not only to perform rapid speech but to  pay attention to inflexion.
If for no other reason than for exercising the muscles of the tongue and mouth I consider tongue-twisters to be a part of primary school study.
