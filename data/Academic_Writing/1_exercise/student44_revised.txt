For a modern person it is very important to be able to speak intelligible. This skill should be developed as early as possible due to specific features of language acquisition. Because of this tongue-twisters (expressions that are difficult to articulate clearly) should be included into the language programs of primary schools. Learning tongue-twisters is a good way of developing childrenâ€™s speech because they can make school lessons more interesting for kids and turn boring exercises into a game. Some research show that children acquire various skills faster and more effective if they are playing a game. So, compulsory tongue-twisters seem to be a required improvement of school educational programs.
