In primary school children train their skills of speech production and correct pronunciation . Including tongue twisters into the learning process can be very useful. The development of pronunciation skills encourages the improvement of elocution. The tongue twisters allow people to learn to articulate words with alliteration rapidly and without mispronouncings so they are extremely helpful for treatment of some speech defects. Getting familialized with the tongue twisters as a form of a wordplay helps to develop extraordinary thinking. Since the pronouncing of tongue twisters is very entertaining, it perfectly suits the learning process in primary school and definitely should be included into it.
