Do primary school students need to learn tongue-twisters? I believe it’s a good activity. Not only because it might be great fun to compete against your classmates in who says a tongue-twister best, but because it benefits children’s speaking abilities. A lot of children speak so that no one can understand, and this might be the solution of the problem. If children learn tongue-twisters at class, there’s no need in going to the speech therapist. Tongue-twisters make children’s enunciation more distinct, so they can do better while telling a poem, for example. Anyway, tongue-twisters do nothing but good, so why not include them in the language programs of primary schools.
