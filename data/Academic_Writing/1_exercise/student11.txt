I would not support the usage of tongue-twisters in essential language learning programs. Tongue-twisters are a way to enhance or restore the speaker's physical ability to produce speech in any language, but they have no connection with the knowledge of a single language itself. language learning programs should consist of four intectonnected parts - speaking, listening, writing and reading. Fast and fluent speaking, being a physical ability, is not required in any of these four fields. Instead, each of these is trained by consecutive practice, supported by introduction and usage of the grammar system.
