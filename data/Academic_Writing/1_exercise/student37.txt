I suppose that tongue-twisters should be included in the school program. I think so because people learn the pronunciation of the words in childhood. If you want to have clear and intelligible speech which others will understand, it is very important to learn how to shape the mouth and how to make a right position of the tongue. These all will help in realizing a wish to pronounce everything correctly. Actually, this is the purpose of tongue-twisters which are designed to be difficult to say correctly and thus to enhance peopleâ€™s pronunciation. Moreover, it is a fun way of learning that makes this type of education suitable for children.
