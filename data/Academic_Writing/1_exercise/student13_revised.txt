Tongue twisters can significantly contribute to language development programs in primary schools. Designed to pose a phonetic challenge, they are the exercise of choice for improving speech fluency and coherence. Advanced speaking skills, in their turn, ensure successful social development and adequate levels of self-confidence. Besides speech, tongue twisters enhance students' short-term memory and increase their attention span by requiring hard concentration during the exercise. Despite being challenging, tongue twisters will keep the students engaged due to the emotional and competitive nature of the task. These are the reasons why tongue twisters should be included into the primary school curriculum.
