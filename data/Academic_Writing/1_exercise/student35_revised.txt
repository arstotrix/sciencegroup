In my opinion, tongue-twisters should be included into the language programs of primary schools. 
	First of all, tongue-twisters are an efficient means of developing pronunciation skills. Children would learn to articulate clearly, fluently and correctly without stumbling, mispronunciation or even without stuttering or lisping.
	Secondly, tongue-twisters are a challenging word game, which is extremely important for primary school students.
	Last but not least, children who have some speech problems would not feel uncomfortable in a class because they will be able to train and improve their language skills.
	In conclusion, I believe that tongue-twisters are not just helpful but also amusing and engaging both for the children and for their teachers.
