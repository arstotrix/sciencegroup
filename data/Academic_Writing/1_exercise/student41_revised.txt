It is common knowledge that tongue-twisters help people to improve their articulation and speak more fluently. Many people practice reading them in order to pronounce complex combinations of sounds in the right way and thereby to get a clear understandable speech.
Everybody knows that it is better to start learning something new in the early age because children assimilate information more quickly. Moreover, speech starts forming early as well, and that is why tongue-twisters can make a good ground for children learning language. I believe these facts show the advantages of including tongue-twisters into the language programs of primary schools.
