We begin to develop our speech at an early age. However, there is a way how to make our  speech better with fun and profit at the same time: use tongue-twisters.
A tongue-twister is a short, syntactically correct phrase, which is difficult for a quick utterance. It can help children to make their diction better. Besides, using alliterations, rhymes and complicated combinations of phonemes can be a speech trainer for people with speech problems. There is a possibility to solve these problems already in childhood. Children can learn to talk more fluently and neatly at primary school. That's why, education workers should draw attention to it.
