Tongue-twister is a phrase that is designed to be difficult to articulate properly, and can be used as a type of spoken word game. Some tongue-twisters produce results which are humorous when they are mispronounced.
However, currently, tongue-twisters are an optional part of the curriculum, as they are only used if the child has problems with the pronunciation of certain sounds or sound combinations. Although, they are the main speech exercises to achieve the purity and clarity of pronunciation, improve diction and increase the rate of speech. Tongue twisters help children to learn their native language in a quick and effective fashion. All of above are solid arguments for the inclusion f tongue-twisters in the curriculum.
