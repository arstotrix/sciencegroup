A tongue-twister is a phrase which is deliberately created to be difficult to pronounce due to periodic alternation between similar phonemes.Usually, its mispronunciations lead to humorous result. However, is it possible to use tounge-twisters not only as source of fun but in educational purposes?
In my opinion, we should take seriously opportunity of adding tongue-twisters into language programs of primary schools.
There is no doubt that they will critically help improve speech fluency of the children.
Moreover, long tongue-twisters can be learned by heart, exercising pupils' memory.
Finally, process of learning tongue-twisters is full of joy, so little children will not get bored.
That is why I think we should include tongue-twisters into primary schools curriculum
