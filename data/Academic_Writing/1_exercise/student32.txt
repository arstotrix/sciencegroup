It seems to me that inclusion of tongue-twisters would improve native-speakerâ€™s language in some aspects. It is a quite common fact, that many people have problems with pronunciation, when using tongue-twisters would help to solve them. Hence, it would not be necessary to turn to speech therapists. In addition, there is a belief that tongue twisters are very useful to enhance oral language skills in learning of foreign languages. And last but not least, tongue-twisters would make learning language an engaging and fascinating process. All in all, the introduction of them can appear a useful and significant practice.
