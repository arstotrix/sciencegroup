It is common knowledge that tongue-twisters help people to improve their pronunciation and speak their own language as long as foreign ones more easily. Many people practise reading them quickly in order to pronounce complex combinations of sounds in the right way and thereby to get a clear understandable speech.
It is also a common knowledge that starting learning something new is much better in the early age, because children always assimilate information more quickly. Moreover, speech starts forming in the early age as well, and that is why tongue-twisters may be essential for making a good ground for children learning language. I suppose, these facts are very vital and show the advantages of including tongue-twisters into the language programs of primary schools.
