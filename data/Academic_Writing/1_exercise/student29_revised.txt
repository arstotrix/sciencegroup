In many languages certain sounds are hard to articulate even for a native speaker and especially for children. Speech therapists required a kind of linguistic exercises aimed to teach people how to pronounce these difficult sounds. And tongue-twisters, as phrases with extremely complicated articulation, nowadays serve for such purposes. In practice, they are mostly applied to kids, who perceive tongue-twisters as a funny game and not as a boring exercise.
Moreover, tongue-twisters are considered to be a part of the folklore and therefore pupils could adopt a part of a national culture by learning them. Thus the inclusion of tongue-twisters into the language programs of primary schools might be useful.
