Usually tongue-twists increase the opportunity for a child to be able to improve his or her ability to pronounce specific sounds. Since some children might not be able to pronounce sounds like “r”, there is a range of tongue-twists that are based on the “r” sound, so when a child keeps practicing saying it out loud, there is a possibility that he or she might improve their pronunciation. It can also be used to diversify the vocabulary for the pupils at a primary school. Some of the words in tongue-twist might appear to be new for a child and would require explaining and diversify the vocabulary.
