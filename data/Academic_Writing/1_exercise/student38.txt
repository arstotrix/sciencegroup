Native language education is considered to be important in primary school. It focuses mainly on improvement of writing and reading skills. Development of correct and clear speech often stays out of school program, although many children have problems with articulation. A resolution could be an introduction of tongue-twisters learning. Tongue-twisters are a perfect and a simple method of teaching how to articulate sound. They are also a vivid demonstration of importance of differentiation of sounds and phonemes, showing how an improperly pronounced sound can change the whole meaning of a phrase. Teaching tongue-twisters would lessen the number of children with speech problems and develop their linguistic feeling and imagination.
