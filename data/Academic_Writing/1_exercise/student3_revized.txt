By their very nature, tongue twisters are challenging to pronounce. With their repetitive use of similar sounding sounds, words and syllables, they can trip up the tongues of even the most articulate individuals. However, as fun as they are, tongue twisters have a very practical application. As such, tongue twisters can be used to treat speech problems in speech therapy, and help reduce the prominence of a foreign accent. This use of tongue twisters in speech therapy is universal for all ages and users.
