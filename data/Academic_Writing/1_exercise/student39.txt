Lots of people use tongue-twisters as “speech gyms” of unmatched quality - politicians, rhetors, and, of course, speech therapists. Constant training with help of tongue-twisters is considered to be one of the best ways to amplify clarity of speech and fight pronunciation issues. Through regular “tongue-twisting” you can easily develop steady, clear and fast speech, which is valued throughout the whole life - by employers, friends; precise and accurate talking is associated with confidence and solidity. Therefore, it is quite obvious that the use of twisters is more than justified in schools. Lots of pupils suffer from speech issues, which, if unnoticed, would later take roots and become remediless.
