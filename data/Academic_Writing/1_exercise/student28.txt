I think, that tongue-twisters should be included into the school program. 
Firstly, it can help the pupils to improve their speaking skills.
It is extremely important for children, who have problems with pronunciation of some sounds, for example, burr.
For other children it can become a good preparation for studding foreign languages with difficult phonology. 
Secondly, scientists say, that all types of small motility develop children's intelligence. 
I think, that it is true not only about hands and fingers, but also about such an important part of the body as tongue. 
Because of that practicing tongue-twisters can be very useful for the child, f their parents want them to study  maths, physics or other sciences. 
All in all, I am convinced, that tongue-twisters are very important for development children's development so they should become a part of the school program.
