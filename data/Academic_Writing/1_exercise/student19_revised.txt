How can we help children improve their pronunciation? I think the inclusion of tongue-twisters in primary schools’ curriculum should be very useful.
Firstly, it is easier to obtain a skill in the childhood than to retrain later. Secondly, improper diction may result in spelling mistakes in writing performance, as children’s writing is phonetic-based, if they are native speakers of one of the European languages. Thirdly, many children find tongue-twisters funny, which is also a great advantage.
To conclude, tongue-twisters are indeed useful and should be included into the language programs of primary schools.
