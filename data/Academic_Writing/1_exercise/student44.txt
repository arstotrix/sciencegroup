For a modern person it is very important to be able to speak clearly and legible. This skill should be developed as early as possible due to some linguistics reasons. Because of this the inclusion of tongue-twisters into the language programs of primary schools should take place. Learning tongue-twisters is a good way of developing childrenâ€™s speech and articulation because they can make school lessons funnier and more interesting for kids and turn boring exercises into a game. It is scientifically proven that children acquire various skills faster and more effective if they are playing a game. So, compulsory tongue-twisters seem to be a required improvement of school educational programs.
