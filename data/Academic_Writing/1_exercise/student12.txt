From the beginning of learning a foreign language it is crucial for a student to develop proper and fluent speech. However, it is a complicated task for a teacher to explain all the details of foreign pronunciation to a child. Tongue twisters can become an easy and funny way to do it. They contain words with similar sounds and therefore are challenging to pronounce. As a primary school student faces this challenge, he/she tries to pronounce tongue twisters again and again, makes mistakes, tries to correct them and thus improves his/her pronunciation. Very soon the student's speech becomes more clear and understandable without making too much effort. This is why tongue twisters must be included into the language programs of primary schools.
