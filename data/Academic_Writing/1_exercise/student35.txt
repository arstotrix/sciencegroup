In my opinion, tongue-twisters should be included into the language programs of primary schools. 
	First of all, tongue-twisters are an efficient means of developing pronunciation skills. Children will learn to articulate clearly, fluently and correctly without stumbling and mispronunciation. They even will be able to treat some speech problems like stuttering or lisping.
	Secondly, tongue-twisters are challenging and enjoyable word game. Namely game that is the most appropriate for little boys and girls.
	Last but not least, children who have some speech problems will not feel themselves uncomfortable or ashamed in a class because they will get a wonderful opportunity to train and improve their language skills.
	In conclusion, I suppose that tongue-twisters are not just helpful and profitable but also amusing and engaging both for the children and for their tutors.
