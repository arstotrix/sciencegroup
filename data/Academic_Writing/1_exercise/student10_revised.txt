Tongue-twister is a phrase or a short rhyme that is designed to be difficult to pronounce; in most cases that is achieved by alternating similar phonemes. Tongue-twisters are extremely useful for developing one’s pronunciation and articulation skills. Also, they are often fun to learn and present some kind of a word game that most children like. That’s why, in my opinion, they should be included in the language programs of primary schools. Every person learns to speak from an early age, so I think it is reasonable to practice tongue-twisters as a child to avoid speech problems in the future.
