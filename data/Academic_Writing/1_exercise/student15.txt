Tongue-twisters are usually considered to be a part of folklore culture. So they can be included into primary school curriculum since some folklore texts usually are. Nevertheless I want to propose another reason for including tongue-twisters into education programs. Tongue-twisters are phrases designed to have similar sounds in various combinations, which makes them difficult to be pronounced quickly. It is a well-known fact that some primary school pupils have problems with proper articulation. Practicing quick pronouncing of  tongue-twisters can help them to master their articulation whether in their native language or in a second one. On this account tongue-twisters should be included into school curriculum.
