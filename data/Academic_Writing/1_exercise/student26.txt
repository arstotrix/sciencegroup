A tongue-twister is a phrase which is hard to pronounce due to many similar sounds and sound combinations in it. Nowadays it is treated as a folklore genre rather than an educational feature. In my opinion, it is not right, and tongue-twisters should be learned by children as a part of the school program. Why? First of all, tongue-twisters help children to speak more fluently and comprehensibly, resulting in a faster process of learning overall. Furthermore, they are a good diagnostic tool for different speech malfunctions, which are significantly easier to be cured early on. Finally, tongue-twisters provide a helping hand when learning foreign languages because they indirectly lead to the clearer pronunciation of sounds and better understanding of phonetics.
