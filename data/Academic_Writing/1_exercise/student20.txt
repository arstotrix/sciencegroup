From the very childhood it is useful for a child to develop his speech, its fluency and pronunciation of individual words. This is the main reason for the tongue-twisters to be included into the language programs of primary schools. With the help of everyday training child’s speech will soon become correct, audible and clear for understanding. Moreover, the child tries to penetrate into the meaning of the words and phrases more sensible during the process of memorization without any hurry. To conclude, tongue-twisters are good for improving the child’s concentration and for his entertainment.
