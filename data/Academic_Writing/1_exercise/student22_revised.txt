First of all, it is needed to include tongue-twisters in language courses in primary school because they help children to get used to pronounce complicated words and letter combinations as in their own language as in foreign languages. So learning different languages can become easier. Furthermore, tongue-twisters make speech faster and much more intelligible, which may be more important than speech rapidity. Also because of this speech training many children can avoid speech therapy, which usually includes such methods. Finally, this kind of language exercises can divert children from permanent studies, give them rest for a little and entertain them.
