Tongue-twisters.
	When a child is to go to school it is usually supposed that he/she should speak correctly. Of course not all children have to deal with a logopaedist in pre-school time on an obligatory base, but still they might have some speech defects. And here comes the school strategy of practicing  tongue-twisters - and for some pupils it may turn out to be their last chance to improve their enunciation. 
	Various rhymes or phrases consisting of mouthful words or sounds are well-known to everybody - I am sure there is no exception. But do these phrases really need to be exercised at school? It can be seen as a waste of time since tongue-twisters are considered to be a part of folk arts and therefore should be amused in the company of friends, relatives and only at somebody's pleasure. 
	Undoubtedly tongue-twisters are great in the way of developing one's vocal apparatus. It becomes more floating and executed. The pronunciation and articulation get clearer, more elocuted and proper.  Hence, I see it important to make use of them in school-teaching. First of all, when learning to perform rapid speech a pupil tries to pronounce every sound clearly, without "losing endings", for example - so that he/she could be understood. Secondly, it is important to catch the meaning of what is to be said, a word and a sound separately - even though most of tongue-twisters have no sense at all. Consequently, a child learns not only to speak but to listen and pay attention to inflexion. That will prove useful in further studying when students are to perceive large amounts of different information.
	In general I would like to pay attention to the fact that though tongue twisters can be  silly in some way, they are great for working on articulation. As they are frequently practiced in speech therapy for exercising the muscles of the tongue and mouth they are certainly to be a part of primary school study.
