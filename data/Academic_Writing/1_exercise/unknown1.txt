A tongue twister is a special form of folklore, recognized mostly for the amusement and fun it brings. However, its value seems not to be recognized by the ministry for education workers. Basically, what should we call a tongue twister? It is a sentence that should be pronounced as fast as possible. The words contain the same sounds that are being put in different order, which provokes humorous mistakes through the hurry. But what would be the educational profit of tongue twisters? They are challenging, and as this challenge is faced, there appear strong odds of improving one's speech. Tongue twisters may literarily be means of forming fluent speech with the primary school students.
