Tongue-twisters should be included into the language studies in primary schools.
First of all, tongue-twisters are recognized as the best way of improving pronunciation. Given the fact that many children in primary schools have difficulties with pronouncing particular sounds, tongue-twisters gain even more value. Phonetic design of these short sentences helps to cope with speech difficulties and to increase fluency in a language.
Moreover, learning tongue-twisters enhances concentration and memory. Tongue-twister is an utterance which requires one to constantly keep in mind what is to be pronounced now and next. Hence tongue-twisters constitute an effective exercise for short-term memory and attention.
In addition to these serious practical benefits, children enjoy tongue-twisters as funny games. So they will definitely not be bored in language classes if tongue-twisters are included in the course program.
To sum up all the merits of tongue-twisters, we repeat that they form an entertaining way to improve pronunciation, concentration and short-term memory.
