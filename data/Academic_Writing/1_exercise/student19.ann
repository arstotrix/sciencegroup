T1	note_reviewer_1 290 326	childrenâ€™s writing is phonetic-based
#1	AnnotatorNotes T1	Is there any evidence that children confuse 'r' and 'l', for example, if they pronounce them incorrectly? I don't think so
T2	note_reviewer_1 64 87	seems to be a good idea

T3	note_reviewer_1 590 615	are likely to be included
#3	AnnotatorNotes T3	'Likely' != 'preferably', 'likely' == 'more possible'. Did you mean that? Sounds a bit impersonal, like you comment on the current state of things, maybe canonical 'should, in my view, be included' would be better (it is just a suggestion).
T4	note_reviewer_2 463 466	fun
#4	AnnotatorNotes T4	funny?
T5	note_reviewer_2 132 154	regardless of its type
#5	AnnotatorNotes T5	I suppose, it is not very important to be mentioned, but it is only a supposition
