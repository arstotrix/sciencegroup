It is beyond doubt that there are serious linguistic and methodological grounds to include tongue-twisters into the educational process.
Firstly, they are effective for setting or improving phonetic pronunciation and correcting articulatory aspects of speech.
Secondly, practice of tongue-twisters develops skills of effective listening and the ability to concentrate on the material. It happens when a pupil has to perceive and analyse the information aurally to achieve necessary sounding.
Besides, such phonetic exercises will make learning process more varied and therefore more amusing and attractive for children. 
That is why tongue-twisters should be included into the primary school curriculum.
