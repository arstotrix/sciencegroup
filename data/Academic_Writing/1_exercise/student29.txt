In many languages some sounds are difficult to articulate even for a native speaker and especially for children. Speech therapists required a kind of a linguistic training simulator aimed to teach people how to pronounce difficult sounds. And tongue-twisters, as phrases with artificially complicated articulation, could serve for such purposes. Thus the inclusion of tongue-twisters into the language programs of primary schools could be useful. Moreover, tongue-twisters are considered to be a part of the folklore and therefore pupils will adopt a part of a national culture by learning tongue-twisters.
