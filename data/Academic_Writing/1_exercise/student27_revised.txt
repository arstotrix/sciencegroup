Nowadays the question about whether tongue-twisters should be included in the programs of primary schools or not is disputable. From a liguistic point of view, tongue-twisters are very important as a useful pronunciation practice. For example, with a help of tongue-twisters, children can easily understand what the difference is between the 's' and 'sh' sounds in several words and how to use it and where. In additional, reading and learning tongue-twisters can teach how to speak more fluently and intelligible. Therefore, tongue-twisters can make children speech better and improve their language.
