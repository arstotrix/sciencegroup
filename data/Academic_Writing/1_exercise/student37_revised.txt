I believe that tongue-twisters should be included in the school program. I think this way because people learn the pronunciation of words in childhood. And tongue-twisters will help in making a dream to articulate everything correctly come true. These exercises are designed to be difficult to pronounce the right way and thus to enhance peopleâ€™s articulation. Tongue-twisters teach how to articulate the mouth and how to make a right position of the tongue. Moreover, it is a fun way of learning that makes this type of education suitable for children. If you want to have clear and intelligible speech, you should start working on your articulation from childhood.
