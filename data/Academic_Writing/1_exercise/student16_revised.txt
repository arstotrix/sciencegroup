I think that tongue-twisters should be included into the school program. 
Firstly, it can help the pupils to improve their speaking aptitude.
It is extremely important for children who have problems with pronunciation of some sounds, such as burr.
For other children it can become a good preparation for studying foreign languages with difficult phonology. 
Secondly, scientists say that all types of fine motors develop children's intelligence. 
I think that it is true not only with regards to the hands and fingers, but also relates to such an important part of our body as tongue. Therefore, practicing tongue-twisters can be very useful for the children, if their parents want them to succeed in studying math, physics or other sciences. 
All in all, I am convinced that tongue-twisters are very important for child development and they should become a part of the school program.
