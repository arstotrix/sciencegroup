For a native speaker it is very important to be able to speak clearly and confidently. Tongue-twisters are extremely useful for developing one’s pronunciation and articulation skills. Also, tongue-twisters are often fun to learn and present some kind of a word game. That’s why, in my opinion, they should be included in the language programs of primary schools. Every person learns to speak from an early age, so I think it is reasonable to practice tongue-twisters as a child to avoid problems in the future.
