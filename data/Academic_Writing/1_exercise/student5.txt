I think tongue-twisters are extremely useful for pupils of primary school since they improve articulation and help children to develop speech. The utility of tongue-twisters can hardly be overestimated. 
As is well known, brain activity depends heavily on the level of speech act. Moreover, mistakes made during learning tongue-twisters turn the studying into funny exercises.
Nevertheless some people believe that using tongue-twisters in school is a waste of time. Though it may seem not serious enough, I claim that it is wise to begin the work on oneâ€™s speech in childhood in order to avoid further problems in adulthood.
Thus the usefulness of tongue-twisters appears to be doubtless.
