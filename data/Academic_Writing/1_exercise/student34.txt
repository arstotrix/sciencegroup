Tongue-twister is a phrase that is designed specially to be hard to pronounce. They are mostly used as a game, in which mispronunciation leads to humorous and often vulgar results. But tongue-twisters can be used not only as a game. It is also a good linguistic tool that can come in handy in primary schools. Tongue twisters help children to learn hard-to-pronounce combinations of phonemes in a fun way. Moreover, it helps them to improve their overall pronunciation skills and develop other useful speaking traits. But most important thing in tongue twisters is that they are fun and children percieve it as a game, therefore working more hard to improve themselves without even knowing it.
