Tongue-twister is a phrase that is designed specifically to be hard to pronounce.
They are mostly used as a fun activity, where people try to repeat them faster and faster, and misprononcuation often leads to humorous results.
But tongue-twisters can be used not only for entertainment, they are also good linguistic tools that might come in handy in primary schools.
First of all, tongue-twisters help children to learn combinations of sounds that are hard to pronounce in a fun way.
Moreover, they help children to improve their overall pronunciation and develop other useful speaking traits.
But most important thing in tongue-twisters is that they are fun and children percieve them as a game, therefore working more hard to improve themselves without even knowing it.
