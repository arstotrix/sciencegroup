Tongue twisters can significantly contribute to language and speech development programs in primary schools. Firstly, teachers may use them to let their students practice difficult sound combinations, and thus promote clear pronunciation. In addition, learning short texts by heart can improve students' memory. As an extra benefit, tongue twisters may evoke the students' interest in national folklore and introduce them to the notion of language play. For these reasons, tongue twisters should be included into the primary school curriculum.
