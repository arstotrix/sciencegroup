A noblest speech and clear articulation is something like a "visiting card" of everyone. We begin to develop a flair to it at an early age. However, there is a way how to do it with fun and profit at the same time: use a tongue-twister.
The tongue-twister corresponds a short, syntactically right phrase, which is noted for its' artificially complicated articulation. The words contain the same sounds and complex for pronunciation combinations of phonemes. The tongue-twister uses for training of a diction and pronunciation. Children can learn to talk more fluently and neatly. That's why, education workers should draw attention to it.
