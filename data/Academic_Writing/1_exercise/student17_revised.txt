Including tongue-twisters into the language programs of primary schools is very useful as it helps to refine the process of learning in several ways. First of all, tongue-twisters can improve one’s articulation and speech rate. Moreover, people who speak fluently are more likely to have fewer problems with their written language due to the fact that their language competence is overall higher. However, this is not the only advantage of using tongue-twisters. They also bring fun to the class and help the teacher to hold children’s attention. Therefore, this interesting form of folklore not only improves students’ language abilities, but also makes lessons more interesting and exciting as children laugh at each other’s mistakes and learn through them.
