Tongue-twisters are worth Including into the language learning process. They form the speaker's ability to speak fluently and seamlessly. Also they help to understand the language's phonetic system more thoroughly and surpass any physical boundaries if they exist. Tongue-twisters would offer a significant support for language learners, due to their involvement in the practical speaking part. Some may argue, stating that tongue-twisters are not concerned with the language acquisition, but it is an approved fact that they are. Thus, gaining the ability to speak through the usage of this simple and effective articulation exercise does contribute to the learning process.
