Tongue-twisters should be included into the language studies in primary schools.
First of all, tongue-twisters are recognized as the best way of improving pronunciation. Given the fact that many children in primary schools have difficulties with pronouncing particular sounds, tongue-twisters gain even more value. 
Moreover, learning tongue-twisters enhances concentration and memory. Tongue-twister is an utterance which requires one to constantly keep in mind what is to be pronounced. Hence tongue-twisters constitute an effective exercise for short-term memory and attention.
In addition to these practical benefits, children enjoy tongue-twisters as funny games. 
To sum up, these short sentences with specific phonetic design are an entertaining way to cope with speech difficulties, to increase fluency in a language and to improve concentration and short-term memory.
