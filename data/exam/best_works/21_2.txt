Some people claim that travelling by air leads to environmental problems, so governments should prohibit such an enormous amount of flights. It is a kind of very controversial question, that is why I can only partly agree with this statement.
First of all, taking care of environmental is important, but it should not harm the process of maintaining economical stability and communication all over the world. Air travel provides lots of opportunities for business and helps people to stay in touch with other parts of the world. By reducing a huge amount of flights some really serious problems with transportation may occure. Also this fact can cause the loss of governmental budgets and citizensâ€™ unsatisfaction. Such economical unstability and problems with transportation of people and goods an lead to crisis and serious lack of money.
Furthermore, planes contribute to less air pollution than, for instance, cars and other vechicles. In order to save less poisoned air governments have to create some laws to make people use private cars less instead of making laws to reduce the number of air transportations. Also modern planes become more and more environment-friendly, so using them in nearest future would not be as harmful as it seems.
To sum up, I only partly agree that planes contribute to great air pollution. Also I strongly believe that governments should not introduce laws to reduce air travelling.
