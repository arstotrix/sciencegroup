We are given a bar chart which provides us with information about the changes in the amount of children who have not an opportunity to be educated in primary school in different regions such as Africa, South Asia and the rest of the world. The data is divided in two groups: the number of children in 2000 and 2012.
First of all, the main feature is that the amount of boys and girls without primary school educations decreased in all regions between 2000 and 2012. The best decrease was registrated in South Asia from 32,7 millions children to 9,9 millions. Another trend is that in 2000 the number of boys was bigger than the number of girls whereas in 2012 in all parts of the world except for Africa this trend was different. It was still more uneducated children in Africa in 2012 than in South Asia and the rest of the world.
To sum up, this bar chart shows positive statistics since the number of primary school students rised dramatically.
