The following chart provides information about the amount of time spent, in general, on sports activity by the English citizens of different age and gender.
According to the chart, men, especially young ones, dedicated more time to sports than women. For example, males in the age of 16-24 do exercises in the course of nearly 300 minutes, while women of the same age hardly could spent more than 100 minutes. However, in some cases the number of active women can be higher than men. As it can be observed, women in the age of 55-64 tend to be a bit more active than representatives of another gender. Another important feature, which is demonstrated by the chart, is that older people showed less activity than younger ones. While male teenagers spent almost 300 minutes on sports, the eldest people did not exercised more than 50 minutes.
Overall, it can be observed that men in England are more active in doing sports than women, and the younger people spend more time on exercises than the older ones.
