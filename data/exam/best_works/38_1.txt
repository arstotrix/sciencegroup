Then with Apple's growth the Blackberry's income rapidly decreases, and the least shows the worst result in 2012. At the moment when Samsung continues to grow and reaches its peak, Apple's share badly crushes down up to 60 percent. It happened in 2013, when two others companies Blackberry and HTC start to be outsiders.

Next, the Apple's success never stops, and it overcomes 90 percent of global smartphone profit in 2015. Samsung's part is dramatically decreasing, it is about 15% in 2015, and Blackberry and HTC cannot achieve even their starting positions remaining at the 5% position approximately.
