The bar charts compare the number of users of two versions of Facebook in 2012 and 2013, as well as the most important reasons people of both genders use it.

It can be seen from the first graph that not only the total market share of Facebook has increased, but also that the focus is shifting to the mobile interface. While the number of visitors with desktop computers fell slightly, from about 150 million to just under 140, approximately 95 million people logged in from phones or laptops in 2013, which is almost twice the 2012 figure (50 million).

As for why, both men and women mainly use Facebook for sharing media. However, women are 15% more likely to name that as the main reason, while men consider is as important as receiving updates - both were said to be among the top purposes of social networking by 39% of men. Learning about ways to help others is seen as least important by all, with only 25% of men and 35% of women stating it.

All in all, Facebook remains an important tool for sharing information about one's life. That does not mean it is unchangeable, however, which is evidenced by a rapid growth of the mobile market.
