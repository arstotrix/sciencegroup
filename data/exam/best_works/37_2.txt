Nowadays as the globalization is fastly developing, people from all over the world choose air transportation, as it is the fastest and the safest vehicle. Some people think that existing amount of air travel is not only harmful for the nature, but also is unnecessary, so the governments should reduce it. I can not agree with that.

Firstly, sometimes planes are the only way people can get somewhere, being the only type of transport that can get to a hard to reach destination of being the only vehicle people can use due to their mental or physical health. Secondly, often people are more likely to travel for business and leisure, as the air cargo transportation has a smaller percentage in the number of everyday flights. So the laws, serving to reduce the amount of air travel to common for nowadays people's needs will only cause everyone's disappointment and even rebellions or other kinds of protest.

However, it is true that air travel pollutes the air and by that causes global warming. Nevertheless, other types of transportation are no less harmfull for the environment, so changing the type of pollution to another will not help much.

To sum up, I would like yo say that even though is is proved that air transportation is harmful for the nature, government should seek for other methods of fighting with the pollution, that prohibiting at some point air travelling for business and leisure.
