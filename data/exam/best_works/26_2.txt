Nowadays, air travel can be the cause of air pollution and global warming, that is why goverments could create laws, which will reduce the amount of air travel.
I am agree with the previous statement for several reasons. First of all, enviremental problems becoming more and more significant every year. Goverment should do everything and make all necessary measures to safe our planet. There are a lot of different types of transport, which can replace the airplanes.
Moreover, there is no doubt that airplane is one of the fastest way of travelling, but at the same time it is one of most dangerous. I believe, that the majority of people will prefer the train instead the plane, if goverment explain the danger of airplanes. For instance, goverment can introduce the law to reduce the amount of air travel, but also, make modern trains, which will be fast and more comfortable.
Finaly, in my opinion, not only planes is the cause of air pollution. Different factories, which make airplanes, also «guilty» in pollution of air. If the number of planes will decreased, many factories could be closed. It is also can help.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that this law is a necessary measure, which could help to avoid some enviremental problems such as global warming and air pollution.
