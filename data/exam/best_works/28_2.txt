Although the problem of air transportation is relatively recent, it has already become one of the most canvassing topics in the modern in the modern society and the subject of the heated debate. My strong concern is that new regulations should be passed by authorities so as to out down on the amount of nonessential flights.
To begin with, the fact that emissions from the aircrafts are extremely harmful for the environment is glaringly obvious. With no restrictions on the number of flights, many of which are rather a means of amusement, than a vital necessity, we might soon face an ecological crisis and end up with no shelter for the following generations. Furthermore, the governments should understand that no ‘green’ movement can be an obstacle for those, who do not pay attention to te environmental issues, therefore a law should be passed to stop this. Besides, with a fully implemented system of air travel restrictions and penalties, it would be easier to come up with long-term state programmes for preserving the natural habitat to all it’s inhabitants and citizens.
However, there are people, who disapprove of such an initiative, claiming that the state is trying to set limits to their rights and freedoms. There might be some truth in that still, I believe that everyone should be in charge for the global environmental problems, such as changes in the ozone layer and greenhouse effect, resulting in global warming. With regard to rights’ limitations we should take into account the fact that our rights and freedoms end where the rights of other person start.
Drawing up a conclusion to my thoughts, I would like to stress, that only global efforts of all the people of Earth can open new vista in the face of today’s harsh ecological circumstances, and it is up to the authorities throughout the globe to be trendsetters. Nothing should be taken for granted and the future of our planet is not an exception.
