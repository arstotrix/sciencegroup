Some people believe that social networks, including Facebook and Vkontakte, are aimed at entertaining users while others consider them to be a way for sharing information and knowledge.
In my opinion, people use social media mainly to disseminate or gain some relevant informational content. Vkontakte or Facebook contain such a lot of data as books, films, audio files or just different facts. We use all of them to learn something new or to discuss with our friends. Furthermore, nowadays social networks are a place where educational resources can be found. There are special pages where teachers arrange lectures about certain themes or where students can share their knowledge with each other. What is more, social media has become a really important way to disseminate information. For example, if somebody is seriously ill and needs to have too expensive medical treatment, his relatives gain requires sum of money from different users of a social network.
However, there is a different opinion. There are those who think that social media is a way only to entertain ourselves. They claim that the majority of people use it in spare time just to relax by chatting with friend and watching funny videos.
There is some truth in what they say but I cannot support their point of view. Iâ€™m sure that modern people are aimed of gaining profit, so even in their leisure time they try to get some necessary information.
In conclusion, social networks have become an important resource through which we can share data and our knowledge.
