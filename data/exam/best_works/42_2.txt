Air travel is said to be the source of air pollution and one of the causes of global warming. There is an opinion that authorities should limit this kind of travel. I do not agree with this statement.

To my mind, travelling by plane is an important part of the world's transportation system. Today a lot of people choose this mean of transport for both individual and business purposes because it is the fastest and the most convinient way to reach any corner of the world, which can even be on the another continent. Indroducing the law limiting air travel can cause a negative reaction of the people and also overcrowding of other means of transport. Moreover, increasing use of other forms of travelling because of the reduce in one will also pollute the environment to the same extent.

Nevertheless, the are those who are convinced that lessening the amount of air transportation can help to solve the problems of air pollution and global warming because they find air transport is not "eco friendly". However, even today there are low-cost airlines which pollute the air less than usual airlines. Furthermore, they say that air transportation is not as safe as other ones, and air catastrophas have also a bad effect on environment, but the rates of catastrophas in the air are not so high according to statistics.

In conclusion, it is vital to note that air travelling is not the only cause of environmental problems and reducing air traffic cannot solve them but, in contrast, some new challenges can appear.
