The provided graph depicts how global smartphone profits of four companies changed in a five-year period starting from 2010.

As we can see, the most competing smartphone companies are Apple and Samsung. Both of them had percentage share increased for three years but the year 2013 became a turning point, as Samsung had almost 10% increase while there was a 10% drop for Apple. However, after this the latter had enourmous percentage jumps and the former decreased significantly. It is also interesting to notice that despite a temporal fluctuation Apple remained the most profitable company across all five years.

Looking at Blackberry, a permanent downward trend can be seen, though it was even more popular in the year 2010 than Samsung. As for HTC, it is considered to be the least popular company with a profit of less than 20 per cent each year.

Overall, the situation on the global smartphone market tended to change many time but the leader company stayed the same.
