The chart provides the information about the average time spent on sport activities in England in 2012 by both men and women.

The largest amount of time (282,1 min) was spent by men aged 16-24, while the smallest (10 min) was spent by women at the age of over 75 years. As one can see the tendency of spending time on sport decrease when people become older. Nevertheless, there is an increase in the period of 76-74 years among men.

A more detailed look reveals, that women spend less time on doing sports than men in general. The biggest gap is 168 min (age 16-24 years). However, there is no such a dramatic change in women's time spending on exercise comparing to men (e.g. women, aged 25 to 34 years and 35 to 44 years have the same amount of time spent on sports, while men's is decreasing).

To sum up, obviously the time spent on sport decreases due to the age among both women and men in England. While men spend more time doing sports, women's time dedicated to sport does not experience such drastic changes. At the age of 75 and older people almost do not spend time on sport.
