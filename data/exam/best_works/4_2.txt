Air pollution and climate change become a greater problem than it was before because of the change of our lifestyle. One possible way reduce it is to create legal regulations for air travel.
I agree that such actions are essential. Firstly, the government can create taxes for air travel tickets and relocate the collected money into ecological programs and projects. Obviously, the cost of tickets will increase which will lead to lower demand for air travel companies’ services.
Furthermore, reducing the amount of travelling abroad is helpful for the national economy as it motivates people to spend money for the leisure inside the country. As a result, the leisure centers inside the country will develop and extend and people might choose more often to stay within their country for the vacation and not to travel abroad.
However, there are some points, which are needed to be taken into account. Firstly, it doesn’t necessarily mean, that the government will spend money gained from air travel taxes on resolving ecological problems. Secondly, the taxation of air travelling is complicated by itself as it might lead to significant financial damage for air travel companies.
In conclusion, it must be cleat that the ecological problems might lead to worse consecueneses than issues with air travel companies, so they must be priovitised and be taken into account firstly by governments worldwide. Ecological policy is an essential concern for every country, so all the states must develop a strategy in that sphere, even though it might be complicated in terms of financial situation.
