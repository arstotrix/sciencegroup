Global warming and air pollution by technological progress in transport engineering form a problem that is one of the most widely discussed all around the world. This issue affects every single one person and therefore cannot be left without attention. Some people believe that governments have to minimize the amount air travel in order to save ecology while I believe that it is not necessary and, moreover, not enough to protect our planet: from dangerous pollution.
Firstly, aircrafts are simply not the greatest danger our planet ecology face. There are around 50000 flight registered every day which is few times less than the number of car trips completed. It leads to a thought that it would be smarter to manage and regulate car usage which woutd minimize pollution rather than introducing laws to reduce air traffic.
Secondly, technological innovations have to be taken into consideration too. Worldâ€™s most famous enterprises that produce airplanes spend millions of dollars in order to achieve higher results in eco-friendly engineering. This means that aircrafts, used in transporting people, produce less air pollution than the ones that were used years ago and all measures required are taken in order to follow international standarts of ecological production aimed to safe our planet.
To conclude, governments have to concentrate, on same more serious sources of global warming and air pollution rather than just sticking to one insignificant source and leaving unnoticed most dangerous ones.
