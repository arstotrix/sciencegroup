Nowadays air pollution, global warming and other environmental problems are very urgent. One of the reasons of them is a rising amount of air travelling for business and leisure activities. Some people believe that government should decrease air flights by introducing strict laws, while others are not agree with this idea.
As for me, I strongly disagree with this idea. First of all, according to the statistic much more poisonous gas and exhaust fumes are produced by cars, due to this fact it will be more useful to introduce more laws for reducing amount of cars which is constantly rising nowadays.
Moreover, reducing the amount of air flights will cause some kind of economic crises for air flight companies and influence the number of people who will start use their private transport such as cars, and using of trains and ferries is also will increase. However, this kinds of transport produce more waste in the atmosphere. As a result, this laws for reducing air travel will not be effective and useful for the environment and will lead to crisis.
However, decreasing of number air travel will lead to some positive effects as more strict rules for technical equipment of planes, as a result, air flights will become not only more nature friendly, but also safier for passengers.
In conclusion, I must say that reducing the amount of air travel by introducing laws be government is a quite useless idea which will not help to decrease air pollution or global warming significantly, but will lead to serious economic problems all over the world.
