This chart shows how many children is different parts of the world did not have access to primary school education in the gears 2000 and 2012.
We can see that the number of children without access to primary education has decreased greatly in all the regions shown in the diagram. One should also note that the decrease was generally slightly faster for the girls that for the boys.
This chart also shows that Africa had the worst primary education both in 2000 with nearly half of all children lacking the access to it and in 2012 with almost a third of the children not having the access. It can be also noted that Sout Asia has made the largest improvement over the years shown, giving almost a quarter of its children access to primary school.

To conclude, I can say that the number of children without access to the most basic form of education has decreased all amount the world. However, in some regions the number is still high, on my opinion, we should do something about this.
