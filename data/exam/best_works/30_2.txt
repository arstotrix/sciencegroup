Shipping cargo and the passengers by airplanes leads to polluting the atmosphere and the raise of temperature all over the world, so must be taken laws for the reducing the number of air travel for business and tourism activities. In this essay both arguments will be introduced on this topic.
Some say that we should reduce the number of the flights to save our planet and ecology. Carbon dioxide which is thrown in the atmosphere by planes causes global warming and ice melting and planes produce most of it, so less planes means less pollution. However, cars produce much more CO’s in total but nobody talks about banning them.
Others have strong belief that rulling air travel industry by government will cause a decline in a number of companies connected with that field of economy. They claim that for same undeveloped countries tourism is the only way of earning the money as for the businessman as for the government budget, so by these eco-laws the economics will crush in logistics, tourism and other sectors, but they forget  that our planet’s resources are not timeless and now we face the problem of the existing of our environment which is more important than the economy.
As for me, I tend to believe that the best way to solve this problem is to find alternative sources of energy and to make eco-friendly techologies. For example, electric planes which wouldn’t harm the planet.
All in all, the question of government rulling in air travelling is not the easiest one, so each country should decide for itself what is better, but personally I think that developing safe technologies is the best solution, but until it becomes common to humanity. We mustn’t regulate the number of flights and harm economics.
