As air travel has contrinuted greatly to the pollution, the goverments all among the world have started to look for the way to reduce it, by passing special legisiation. Personally, I think that while while something must be certainly done, creating additional taxes on straight up banning air travel is a hit of an overkill.
I think that the growing number of people travelling by air means that people need it for their own pullposes unknown tous. In this case, the governnants should not deny people access to things and services they need, and they need some other way to decrease the pollution caused by air travel.
For example, they can finance advertisement companies against air travel in order to reduce people’s dependence on it. For example, they may reason that life travel in its state leads to global warming and that people should use the plane less frequently in order to save our planet. Such companies have already been done by newspapers line «The New-York Times» to some degree of success. Moreover, the governments can subsidize the development of alternative means of transport that offer convenience and speed comporabie to those of the air travel, line Elon Mustc’s «Hyperloop».
In addition to social advertisements and developing alternative means of transportation, governments can also invest in developing technologies that reduce the amount of pollution meated by air travel, line meating new kinds of fuel efficient airmost evepnes.
To conclude, I am going to say that banning something is almost never the right way to go. In order to lessen the norm from something as important as the air travel, a viable alternative should be always provided. So the governments should not pass lows to directly decrease the number of people travelling via a plane, but should finance creation of the alternative, or nesearcu to make air travel more efficient.
