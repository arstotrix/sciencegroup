Nowadays more and more people travel by air for their business trips of vacations. Some people think that this way is the most convenient one and should be developed further while other suppose that air travelling should be regulated by authorities as it pollutes the air and cause global warming. To my mind, the amount of air travel should be reduced.

To start with, air pollution which is caused by the planes and its fuel can be extremely harmful for people's health. These pollutants which are emerged into the atmosphere during the air travel can get into people's lungs, accamulate there and cause, for example, a cancer or other serious deseases. Moreover, the air pollution also contributes to global warming which can cause undesirable climatic changes and make harm to the environment.

However, the supporters of the opposite point of view belive that modern technologies allow us to make these air pollutants less harmful with the use of different filters. In addition, air travel is the fastest and the most comfortable way to make trips, especially from one continent to another.

Nevertheless, in my opinion, the amount of air travelling should be reduced as the engineers can not completely exclude these harmul gases from the fuel of planes which are emerged into the atmosphere. Also, this way of travelling is not always safe.

To sum up, some people assume that the amount of air travel should not be reduced by government regulation as it is necessary for long trips but I am absolutely sure that air travelling should be decreased legally with the help of authorities as it can be dangerous for the environment.
