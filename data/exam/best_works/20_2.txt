Evidence seems to suggest that the dispute about the effectiveness and environmental usefullness of the air travelling is extremely merit. There are plenty of people and authorities who are absolutely sure that modern society can easily exist without travelling by plane. Moreover, reducing the air travelling will lead to saving the environment. I absolutely do not agree with that the statement and now I am going to consider my point of view.
Firstly, air travelling is the fastest kind of transport by present day. Great number of people use it every day to get to the destination, which may be extremely far from their homes. What is more, people us planes not only for their targets, a lot of business trips happen each day. And can you imagine the situation, when have to have a deal on millions of dollars US, and the should spend some days or maybe weeks to meet with their partners. As a result, the economy of many countries can be damaged greatly as well.
Secondly, if governments reduce the number of air travels, there is no doubt that soon they will find an increase in using other kinds of transport, which are not less environmentally harmful as planes, like cars, trains, buses and so on. It is obvious that all these transport can be as damaging for the nature, as planes do, or maybe ever more.
And finally, governments risk to meet with dissatisfied people, as the reducing the flights means the increasing costs on other transport and disability of people to get to place in the latest way.
To sum up, I would like to say that surely air travelling is dangerous for the nature and soon it will appear in great problems for the mankind. However, we should not recognize that as the only one factor and concentrate on what is, obviously, supposed to be the best and most modern way of travelling on long distances.
