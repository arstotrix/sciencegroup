Nowadays in many families children spend less time with their parents than they did in the past. It happend because both parents go to work and have less time to spend with their children. To understand this trend in a more deep way it is important to take a closer look at the reasons of this phenomena and at the possible problems in can cause.

According to the sociological classification of societies, we now live in post-industrial one. One of its typical features is the dominant position of nuclear family - a family of parents and children where two parents often go to work. Both mother and father have to go to work also because of severe financional conditions and the necessity to pay for the housing and child's education. Moreover, now that we live in a modern society, women also have an opportunity of self-realization through work and of building a successful career.

However, this trend may cause negative effects in the society. Children who grop seeing their parents seldom lack primary sociolazation, the most important one. It will then lead to the situation where people grow up without basic social and communication skills. Then, children feel not enough love and support from their parents and may unconsiously reproduce such family model in future, raising the generalizations of underloved individuals. Lack of parental love and attention causes anxiety, nervous conditions and even mental diseases, for example, depression.

In conclusion, described phenomena takes its origins from high demands in modern society and also wide range of opportunities for women. Unfortunately, it affects society in a whole and particulary children in a bad way, creating a new model of reality where money means more than love and family values.
