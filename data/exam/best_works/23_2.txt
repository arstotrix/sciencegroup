I could not agree more that air travel is one of the cause of global warming and air pollution because of its greenhouse gases. However, I think that government regulation of this public transport hits the liberty. Let us analyze everything in detail.
First of all, there are basic human rights which say that any travel should be free, despite the purposes. It means that authoritys could not order which travel is unnecessary. For example, statistics shows that about 50% of people all over the world have very hard work, so they need continious rest. In this case it is illegal to ban rases to resorts.
In addition, I believe that the majority of modern countries are democratic. Consequently, the government has not power to introduce such radical laws without public discussions. For instance, in Australia the authorityes got an idea to change the national flag in 2009. But many cityzens were agains and after voting it was saved the old flag.
On the other hand, my opponents argue that it is very dangerous to the natural environment to allow huge amount of air travel. I can not agree with that at all. I believe that the main cause of air pollution is greenhouse gases from our cars. Airplane is very expensive machine, so the amount of them is quite little in the world. However, there are thousands and thousans cars in our streets.
All things considered, I strongly believe that governments shouldnâ€™t introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel.
