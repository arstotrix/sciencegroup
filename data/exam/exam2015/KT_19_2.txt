One of the main problem of a modern city is the lack of time, which we can spend outdoors. The majority of children are so busy, as they have got no opportunity to learn something about nature by their own, which is very important for them. 
On the one hand, all the information about natural processes are given children at school. Nowdays there is no need to go to the forest for watching at squarels. A great number of pictures or videos can be shown at a classroom. Besides, going with a child to the natural world may be dangerous. Sometimes child can grab or taste something, while parents do not see, and it may lead to a bad consequences, like stomachache, hand cutting or he can hurt his leg. To avoid such problem parents should pay more attention to them.
But on the other hand, nothing can be compared with your own experience. People better learn and memorize things, connecting whith practise. Watching animals, touching plants, hearing sound - all of these help children to understand and appreciate nature. The most exciting things is to explore unknown. It grabs childrenâ€™s attention and brings them great pleasure, expands their horizon. Moreover, spending time on the fresh air and playing active games have a good impact on their health. It may reduce the opportunity of heart diseases, obesity or joint problems. Also, if younger generation have spend more time surrounded by nature, probably they would more appreciate it and would try not to pollute environment in future. 
To sum up, I would like to say, that in the age of high technological progress people have everything, what they need just in their house and all needed information is collected in the Internet. But we should not to forget about importance of being outdoor. There is no technological resourse, which can replace nature in our life. In my opinion, it is really important to teach children appreciate nature.
