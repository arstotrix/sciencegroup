Nowadays children lead sedentary style of life, they study at school, do their homework and play computer games, all this actions have no common with nature. In this essay reasons why children should know more about our nature will be done.
Our food our clothes and humans themselves exist because of natural world. If children have no experience with nature (for example, how grew plants, what mushrooms are poisoned and so on), they may have problems in future life. So children should learn to understand nature to survive, but also nature is very beautiful. It inspires people to create something new life novels, poems, picture. Children should spend more time outdoors, to go camping, for example, if children understand and know better our nature, they will love it. 
In recent years, people have done a lot of damage, polluted air and water, created a lot of garbage. So if next generation follow us, continue to spoil nature and to forget about what role nature has in our lifes, maybe people will not exist in next century.
I suppose government should change education system, invest more money in such educational programme which will help children to understand consequences of their ordinary actions do and which will encourage people to change their habitats. Also social advertising is very powerful, encourage children to appreciate nature is better than encourage them to buy another chikenburger. Such measures will help to tackle with global problem.
To sum it up, children is next generation and they have responsibility to save nature, to prevent it from pollution and others negative effects that create human-being, because of that children should learn to understand and appreciate nature.
