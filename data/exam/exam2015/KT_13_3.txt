Today children have lots of duties, lessons, exercises. All these prevent them from having much free time. Children spend the major part of the day at home and do not have a chance to to go for a walk, simply to see the nature around them. Some people think that it is a mistake, they are sure that children should spend more time outdoors. I can fully agree with this opinion.
Children have many responsibilities, that is why they often forget about such things as the rest in some parks, near different lakes or rivers. It is really wrong because such rest has several advantages. First, it is good for health. Playing some games in parks is more important than sitting all day at home. Parent should encourage their children to leave their houses more regularly. Then, it is a common knowledge that we have a bad environmental situation today. I believe that children that spend much time outdoors, will have more ideas how to save nature, stop pollution in future.
Moreover, the nature helps people to feel calm, gives them an opportunity to stop and to think about some important and valuable things. The nature reminds people that many things in our wworld are fragile and we have to save them. People from villages are usually more pleasant, you can mention is from the first sight. They are simplier and know how to value things.
To sum up, it is necessary for children to spend much time outdoors. Beautiful sights of the nature will make them better people and help them in life.
