There are two points of view about what king of characteristics have much more influence on person's personality. Someone is think that life experiences play a big role in our development, but research shows that personal characteristics depend from with what we are born with.
As for me, I agree with the first point of view. To begin with, when people are born, they always looking by their family, but when person become older he or she has to understand what happening in society and in some keys our environment influence to us. I think that our life experiences can change personality and development, for example, I study in Saint-Petersburg about two years and I came here from another city. When I began to live here, I became more independent, confident and smarter, because I saw what society is are and how it can influence on me. My personality characteristics and development are changed.
