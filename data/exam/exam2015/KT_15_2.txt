It is obvious that children nowadays spend much less time walking outdoors and a lot of time they stay at home. From my point of view it is extremely important for children to enjoy our natural environment. Our Earth has lots of environmental problems nowadays. They are air pollution, watter pollution, a lot of litter around us and so on. So it is essential for us to grow up a generation that will take care of nature.
First of all I think parents should encourage their children to take care of the nature. Children who love nature, who spend much tme playing outside are usually healthier and more active. People are dependant on the quality of the nature and natural sources. It means that we have to feel responsible for the Earth. It is also a good idea for schools to teach more lessons about nature. Moreover it is great to create and popularize a number of laws which makes it compulsory not to drop litter and be careful with environment.
