Task 2
The main activities of modern children are different from children 30 years ago. Nowadays, outdoor games are not as popular as they were and young people hardly know enough about environment.
On the one hand, children should communicate with alive nature, be in countryside and know some information about natural environment, because of fact, that human is biological creature and depends on nature rules. It is clearly, that people need fresh air and sun to be healthy, but also to have good mood and calm state of mind. And as children should spend some time outdoors, knowledge about nature wild warm up interest to being outside and make walkings not boring. Furthermore, human activity damage natural environment annually, if next generation will be unconscious and won’t think about nature, humanity will disappear just in Earth can be useful for general culture.
On the other hand, children are very busy with subjects at school, which will be useful in their further life, maybe significant amount interest to nature will distract young minds. Finally, being “green” is absolutely useless in our time of technologies and gadgets.
In my opinion, parents should take care of health of their children and sometime organize interesting weekends outdoor. to make them responsible and conscious society members.
To sum up, I want to underline that nobody must not love nature, but knowing of its main rules and appreciating it is obligatory for every modern person.
