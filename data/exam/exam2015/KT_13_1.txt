The bar chart below gives the information about the differences in the rate of the Internet access at home. The chart compares urban/suburban users and rural users between 1999 and 2004.
Generally speaking, both areas have a similar trend: the rate of the Internet access had increased. Only 2 per cent of people were able to use the Internet in rural areas in 1999. But by 2004 the situation had improved. From 1999 the rate of the access n rural areas started to rise gradually. In 2004 the percentage of users hit a peak â€“ nearly 36 per cent. In urban/suburban areas the situation wes better from the begining. In 1999 nearly 13 per cent of citizens were able to have the Internet access and by 2004 the rate had increased up to 55 per cent. It is practicually twice as many as in rural areas.
To sum up, rates had plummeted in both areas, but the major part of users in rural areas did not have the Internet access even in 2004.
