Nowadays, more and more urban young people are too busy to go to a countryside and enjoy the beautiful and significant nature around them. Obviously, it is a great problem, because children haven’t got an opportunity to know something about wild nature. As for me, it is especialy important for modern children to understand the natural world where we live.
First of all, we should take care of the atmosphere and the air we breath. Today it has been built enormous number of differen factories, which are extremely dangerous for the atmosphere. If youth understands the importance of clear air for our survival, the world where we life will become much clearer.
Secondly, we shouldn’t forget about the food we eat and water we drink. The quality of these parts of our life strongly depends on our care about the nature. It is a great problem that most of factories don’t clean enought their rubbish and pollute water. 
What we can do to make children think more seriously about the nature? Firstly, parent should give their children more opportunity to play outside and to enjoy the wild nature around them. Moreover, it wpuld be better to vun special lessons at school, where teachers will encourage their student no to pollute the nature. To sum up, it is especialy important for adults to demonstrate a good example of careing about the nature, because the future of nature depends on our childrens’ behavior. I hope, that their attitudes to the nature will be better than our.
