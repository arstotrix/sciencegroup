It has become apparent in recent years that because of the appearance of harder systems of education and some other reasons the life of modern pupils turns in to eternal sitting at school and at home. Some people are convinced that children should always stay keeping in touch with nature. This essay reviews in details this issue and gives some reasons about why it is crutial for children to contact with natural world. 
Firstly, there is a school of thought that knowledge in the sphere of nature can help pupils to achieve some success in school subjects such as Biology, Geography and Chemistry. Studying life cycle of plants or symbiosis of mushrooms and trees improves childr's level of education and erudition. Furthermore, my personal exprerience proved that knowing some facts about natural processes gives a good change to show someone's skills at towns and regional olympaids. 
Secondly, not all of what we learn at school benefits after the graduation, but practice skills and knack of living in forests, for example, will do good job when it is required. The general idea is that schools and government should reverse some subjects from education programme in order to let children develop themselves and stay close to natural environment.
My conclusion is therefor that staying indoors for a long time deprives children an essential part of self-development and mental peace of mind at the same time.
