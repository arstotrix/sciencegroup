A lot of scientists: psychologists, sociologists and even biologists discuss what affects on personality in higher extent: characteristics which we have from our birth day or outcomes of environment surround us.
On my opinion, genetic set, which we get from parents is really important but individual is developing each day, depending on environment and experiences. I think, what we get during our life is more important to personality.
First of all, I want to remark that each person changes himself everyday. We adapt to surrouding world and circumstances influence on our personality and future behavior and decisions.
Personal charactiristics transform as a consequence of every-day experience.
Second, out personal characteristics remain in our private life. In the social life we should hide our true thoughts and, may be, preferences, because a lot of surroundings factors influence on us. Different social norms control our behavior and we become regardless to our personality. We recognise these rules and norms behavior in result of our experience in the life.
But  on the other hand a lot of activities of people owe not limited by social rules. For example, if I have talent to poetry, it helps me to became successful in the literature.
In addition, our future life is dependent on family where we came from. Our opportunities depend on occurence special physical and spirit charactiristics. All of these things we get from born, or, at least, we can tend to some sphere of activity.
To sum up, importance of life experience and charactiristics from our birthday is discussed actively. I think, we shouldn't separate these factors and consider both things.
