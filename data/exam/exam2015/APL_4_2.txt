Adults are always in a hurry, busy with work, family or some troubles while children spend their time at school or home playing computer games, watching TV or doing their hometasks. Thus, most of young generation's time is wasted indoors. This problem affects exposure and perception of the natural world. To my mind, studing the world around us is crucial especially in young age. A child formes understanding and attitude to environment at this stage of life. When he or she explores the natural world and asks parents  how changes weather, what influences different nature disasters and other curious questions, environmental consciousness arises. Therefore, in order to bring up environmentally conscious new generation we should approve spending time outdoors. parents may be make picnics in the countryside or organise various leisure activities at the surbabian area thus forming the interest of a child in exploring the natural world. That is exactly what my parents did. School is also responsible for providing knowledge about world environmental processers. There can be settled tasks to plant a flower or to look up for a small animal. thus, a child will learn what is good and bad for nature so if young generation understands the importance of preserving our planet, pollution of the environment will be reduced in the future. in conclusion, it should be highlighted the influence of environmental conseiousness, which is bringing up in childhood on our future. A person should appreciate nature sinse young age. This fact can help to save the planet and its wild world.N
