Modern society is divided about the ways of spending children’s time, because everything in the world has its pros and cons, and children’s life is not an exception. Some people believe that children should spend more time. Outdoor, others give a low priority to it. Nevertheless, this issue has many doubts and uncertainties and I must dispel them.
As it said earlier, some people suppose that children must spend their time outdoor. Personally, I come out in support of this view. I can remember at least five examples of antisocial behavior which I had seen during my life. The most urgent problem is children’s world outlook and attitude to a computer. From what I gather, I was the same boy about four years ago. And based on my own experience, it was the terrible part of my life. It should be noted that it is not a coincident that the number of pupils who prefer to spend time indoors is dramatically increased for the last ten years. It is directly connected with a technologies boom.
According to others, it is not an issue that many children spend most of their time indoors. Honestly speaking, I can not deduce how parents may allow their children to spoil their vision and health in front of a computer. I do not understand the reasons of parents behavior. The most obvious support of them can be the fact that such parents suppose that their children improve the skills of social communication by using a computer.
In conclusion, it should be noted that I find this problem urgent and believe that first is absolutely right.
