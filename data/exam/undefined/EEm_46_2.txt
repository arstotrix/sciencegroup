With the development of planes and helicopters air has become a popular way of traveling. However, nowadays many scientists believe that air travel damage the atmosphere and can lead to global warming. Taking this fact into consideration, they argue that the policies reducing individual air travel should be introduced by the governments. It might be a good idea, but, in my opinion, it will not make the problem disappear.
To begin with, the situation when police officers take illegal money and close the eyes on the situation can become a detrimental problem as it will lead to the firing of many people. It, in its tern, will help the rate of unemployment to increase, but still will not reduce the number of air travels. What is more, leaving prohibition of air travel only in the mercy of governments will be a mistake. Technicians should also pay attention on aircrafts and the fuel used in them. If we do not change the design and the technical devices of planes, the problem will assist for ages and will cause global warming anyway. It is only a question of time.
Nevertheless, although our world has developed technical devices and transport a lot, people still have lack of knowledge in this sphere. That is why prohibition of air travel for business and leisure can give our society some time to improve our knowledge and skills.
To sum up, there is no doubt that something should be done with air travel. However, the introduction of laws by the government is a good idea which will make environmental changes slower, but will not make the problem disappear.
