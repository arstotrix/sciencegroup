Table about children who have no access to go to school and it sorted by region and gender from 2000 to 2012.
The max of children were in Africa in 2000, it is 23.7 ml of girls and 20 millions of boys. But after 12 years it went down and 18.2 of girls and 14.5 boys had no access to get primary education.

After only12 years situation changed and girls started to have more chance to access primary education becase in 2012 only 4.8 millions of girls have no access to education. Boys have stability access but 5.1 have no ways to get education. If we check rest of world in 2000 and rest of world in 2012 we can see that number of children without access to primary education were going down and it is good statistics because in 12 years after 12.8 mil of girls and 10.5 mil of boys only 7.6 mil of girls and 7.7 of boys have no access to primary education.
