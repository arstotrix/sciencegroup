Nowadays there are many factors that pollute atmosphere and result in green-house effect and air transport is one of them. There is a suggestion to forbid a part of flights that are not necessary from the view of governments. I strongly disagree with statement.
First of all, it is a well-known fact that global warming is still not proved phenomen since there are many controversial positions of scientists. What is more, aircrafts is not the main reason of air pollution as we have a huge amount of cars which make poison gases and other sources of dost.
Secondly, if governments make the laws against air travels it will recuire big efforts to monitoring the type of flight which is suitable for this law and that is not allowed by government. Also it needs the money investions because social researchers must separate air travels which are necessary and not.
Thirdly, it is obviously that forbidden flights may become a reason of negative thoughts about government among people which can lead to manifestations and even crimes in oims to be above this law. In addition, this law would have negative influence on economic connections between different regions because business men have not possibilities to be in touch with their international partners thus many significant tneafies will be lost.
In conclusion, I can say that air transport is the sphere of travel which should be most developed in country and if government tryes to reduce flights in ecological aims if surely become a big problem for economy.
