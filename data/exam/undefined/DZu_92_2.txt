Nowadays, airtravel is not something special and unique. Every day millions of plains go up to the air and this as a result, coused the airpollution and global warming. As we life in the era of global progress we try to save our time. Usege of airtransport is nessery for people to get from one point to other without wasting lots of time, aspecially for business and leisure. I agree, that airplanes pollute the air, but there are many others factors, which have an influence on air conditions to. No way, the government should abondant the flights the main position for air travel is that is saving the time. If people travel with another way, they will waste time only for moving to different place. In case it is business jorney you have to plan in before, and lots of resorses to get in time to the planning place. But if you like to go on vocation, you won’t, becouse you spent all the time for movement.
Secondly, some big flight companies will have big economic failuare after government reduce the amount of air travel. Becouse, the biggest percentage of the income companies get from the touristic air travel and business flights.
To sum up, on my point of veiw, there are many troubles, which have neggative effect on environmental problems dispite the air travel. Government should try to solve this problems without reducing air travel, becouse it isn’t so nessesary and can get a neggative influence on style of people life and economical systems of the counties at all.
