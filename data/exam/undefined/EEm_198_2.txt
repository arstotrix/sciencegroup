There is opinion, that due to the air pollution, goverments should refuse some amount of air travel. I totaly agree with this idea.
Nowadays environment pollution is a vital problem arount the world. And all people are responsible in this disaster. Rabbish, waste, recycling are reasons of this problem. Gas emissions from cars or airline companies also contribute to air pollution and global warming. Of course, I think that governments should make efforts in this problem. It can be introduction of regulation laws or “green taxe”. Also government should refuse some air travel in order to our plane doesn’t suffer because people like fly every day in different countries. I think the magority of this flights are unnecessary and people can easy use trains. Moreover, I think that in modern based-information world a lot of businessmen can use the Internet regarding to their business targets. Nevertheless some flight realy necessaty, for example for transfer medicaments, drags and meals to people in Africa. Despite that I argue that goverment should introduce laws regarding air travels in order to maintain and reserve our planet Earth.
I think that goverment should maintain air travels which is realy needed. It can be really long travels which is pointless on train or bus. Also, it air travels throw ocean or sea. Such as travels are not available on trains. Of course, bus and trains also pollute environment but not so strong like cars and airline companies.
To sum up, I would like to tell, that it is a vital important to take care about our planet and try to reserve it. And I think that goverment should try to do all possible for our planet Earth.
