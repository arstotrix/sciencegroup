These graphs provide information about people who travel to and from United Kingdom and which countries are the most popular among UK residents for travelling.

The first chart shows two trends from 1979 to 1999. The former illustrates the number of people who travel abroad from the UK. The latter shows the number of visitors of United Kingdom. Both trends in the beginning of the period were approximately the same (the number of people was from 10 to 12 million). Over the given period the former and the latter were increasing. By the end of period (in 1999) the difference between both trends became much more noticeable. (the number of UK residents travelling abroad was 52 million people, the number of UK visitors was 28 million people).

The second graph provides information about countries which are often visited by UK residents. The most popular country, as it can be seen, is France (more than 10 million people visit it). The less popular I Spain (the number of visitors is less than 10 million people).

From these two charts it can be noticed that in 1999 the number of people who travel to and from UK increased significantly. Also, it can be seen that UK residents mostly choose Europe to travel.
