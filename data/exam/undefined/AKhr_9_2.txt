Art has always been the thing people argue about. The question is: should government restrict the freedom of the artists or not. Some people claim that art is impossible without total freedom of expression. They say the artist is not able to create something in order the government is ready to see it. Art is out of control of the artist, it just flows out of his mind and he is not able to stop or restrict it. If even the artist is not able to control the art, why government is? There is one more group of people, they argue with the first one. They suppose that in this case art as an any other sphere of human's life is ought to be restricted by government in order to provide safety end equality for everyone. Every person is always restricted by government and society in his/her actions by law, moral obligations an so on. Total freedom is impossible until the man lives in society. Giving extra freedom to artists is unfair because it is not available to all the other people. They are not equal in this situation. I strongly believe that the second group of people is right. Unequality of people can become a cause of separation of the society which is always extremely harmful for the people. The art which is created by artists also can be harmful for some people. An example that illustrates this principle is an artist who was presenting his works on the festival "Белые ночи" in Perm. He painted the symbols of the Olympiad in Sochi in ugly way. Many people were ofended by this. Some fights had place to be. Finally this exhibition was closed because too many people were ofended by this unfair and angre view on the situation.
