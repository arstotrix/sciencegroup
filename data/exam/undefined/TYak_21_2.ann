T13	suggestion 0 422;424 1214;1216 1561	Nowadays more and more schools and colleges realize that their students have problems with their behaviour. It is really difficult problem to be solved, because usually these people are teenagers, who can’t realize all the difficulties of the adult life. Some can easily leave their colleges and schools, some think that they don’t need education at all. So, let’s practice some causes of this and find possible solutions. First of all, I strongly believe that teenage years are most difficult for the people, so adults should help them to adapt to the life. At home there are their parents who do this, at school there should be teachers who have to control their students, teach them not only academic subjects but also tell them what is good and what is bad, teach them to socialize with their groupmates and so on, but most of teachers don’t do it. Secondly, not only teachers should do this kind of work at schools, but also qualified psychologists, who should work in every school and help young students to deal with their educational problems or with communicating problems with other students. If we don’t speak about European countries or the USA, schools usually don’t provide this kind of specialists. There is one good example of solving problem with student behaviour that I can provide. At the midde school one my classmate didn’t pay much attention on his education and always had conflicts with other students. His parents couldn’t do anything with him, so one day school director invited a psychologist who specialize on work with teenagers.
