Many people argue if plane transportation is harmful to the ecology of the surrounding are. Goverments all around the world are demanded to introduce new legal regulation that would restrict certain buisness and holidays flights. But are this measures really necessary? 
On the one hand, it is impossible to deny the fact that the preservation of our mother nature is believed to be the most significant aim of current society. If we had to choose between plane travelling comfort and the existance of the nature itself, we would probably turn to the second option. What is more, the reduction of air travelling might inspire humanity to pick up another types of holidays like eco-travelling which is much more friendly towards the nature and is able to reveal the new era of tourism and ecological care.
On the other hand, it is virtually impossible to shut down all the civillian flights. Due to being the leading type of vehicles in terms of speed and safety, planes can not be prohibited without any fair alternatives. Sudden reduction is probably going to lead to the collapse in the world transportational system and consequence serious damage.
Furthermore, air journeys allow us to travel transcontinentally, which any other type of vehicle have no opportunity to give to us. Humanity must not restrict the majority of air flights right now.
To sum everything up, it should be mentioned that air flights, because of being the major part of transportational web, can not be shut down in the near future. Still, as long as an opportunity to alter it occurs, the humanity should use it and reduce air transportation. In this way only humankind can preserve the natural ecological habitat and continue to develop on the Earth.
