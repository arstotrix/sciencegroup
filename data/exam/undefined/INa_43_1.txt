Task 1.
   The charts provide information with regard to the ages of the citizens of Yemen and Italy, including predictions of changes that will take place in the first half of the 21st century.
   A more detailed look at the charts reveals that in 2000 in Yemen the half of the population is children under 14, while in Italy numbers are much smaller, with only 14,3 percent. According to the elder people, charts also indicate differences in these two countries. The proportion of 60 years old residents of Italy differs from Yemen approximately eight times. If in Yemen it is more than 3 percent, in Italy figures are 24, 1 percent.
   Future predictions about the next 50 years are not change the current situation significantly. In Yemen the percentage of 14 year old is going to reduce to 37 percent, while the number of people from 15 to 59 years and those who are above 60 will increase. At the same time in Italy will be found a rapid growth in elder people, with figures double. However, the number of citizens between 15 and 59 is going to fall from 61,6 % to 46,2 percent.
   In summary, Yemen and Italy are going to experience some changes in their population in the nearest future. It can be seen that the number of young people decreases while the proportion of elder people is rising in both countries.
