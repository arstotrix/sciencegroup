It is obvious that cultural aspects significantly affect other spheres of social life. Nowadays mass culture form the opinion of many people and influence their lifestyle as well. But there are a lot of outstanding and sometimes provocative artists whose ideas, according to some people, may "destroy" the minds of the spectators or readers. So, somebody should control contemporary arts. And the most powerful and legitimate actor who can make some restrictions is the government. Is it really so? Let us think about it. On the one hand, a lot of modern artist try to achieve fame and get money for their new interesting ideas and they usually do it in inappropriate ways to attract more attention of publicity. Moreover for some creators of culture it is very important to spread their genious ideas and express their own views and opinion. As the wise said, there are no frames for thinking and creating wonders. And I constantly agree with this statement. But the fact is that plenty of artists believe their works to be popular. And here we face the main problem. On the other hand to my mind the good government should understand and somehow control the cultural environment in the country because there are a lot of social conflicts and disagreements which arise on the base of cultural preferences. But I believe that it could be done only by professionals who are acquainted with arts. Besides, a special department which has the right to regulate culture, could not make strict prohibitions, but only to recomend citizens to choose consciously what to read and watch. So, it is important to devide culture into two separate types - mass culture, which is proposed to the whole society and should be controlled by specialists in arts and so-called an individual culture, which is afforded only to a narrow layer of the society and has seamless horizons to be developed by outstanding and provocative artists.
