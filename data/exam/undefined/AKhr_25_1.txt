This bar chart illustrates the distribution of post-school qualifications of male and female Australian residents in 1999. Overall, there were five main types of qualifications held. First of all, there were a significant difference in the percentage of men and women having a skilled vocational diploma: while the proportion of males might be estimated as 90%, only 10% of females held this qualification. However, as far as undergraduate diploma and bachelor's degree are concerned, in these categories there was an opposite tendency: whereas women took up 70% and 55% accordingly, the percentage of men did not reach even a 50%-mark. In such qualifications as postgraduate diploma and master's degree there, was observed a clear males' domination. For instance, the percentage of men having a postgraduate diploma was twice higher than the percentage of women and it was estimated at 70%. Overall, there were no determined domination either by males or females, both Australian men and women held various qualifications at the sustainable level.
