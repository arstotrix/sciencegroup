The bar chart present the date about the opportunities of two genders to get primary education in various parts of the world and compare the amount of those who could not get it in 2000 and in 2012.
The main trend of the graph is declining of number of children who have no abilities to go to primary school. The level of these children decreased most significantly in South Asia (from approximately 33 millions to 10) and boys and girls opportunities became practically equal. The lowest results were presented by Africa where the number of children who were not able to get the first step of education diminished just for 20 millions. In other parts of the world this information was nearly the same, but the whole level was lower.
According to the graph, less girls could get education than boys in every part of the world, but it volatiled in 2012. In the second period of exploration in both locations exept Africa young women had a little bit more chanses to start education.
To sum up, education level had increased gradually in some parts of the world and rapidly in others, but part of population that couldnâ€™t get education at all declined and differents between genders disappeared.
