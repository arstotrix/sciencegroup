The longer progress goes, the larger is there the number of people involved in art. In past centures drawing pictures, writing novels, making sculptures were prerogatives of the elite, which overwhelmingly had the same interest as their state had. Now people became more liberal, and what they express does not have to correlate with nation's will. Contemporary governments - especially democratic ones - are strongly concerned with the issues which masses undergo. The more is there complaints about Obama's policy, the less are his odds to win next elections. Such a problem imposes government seduction to control creative artists, who usually have a great authority in people's mind. However we live in the epoch of liberalism, and not to let people create what they want would be hypocricity. A paradigm that claims "everyone is free" can be applied to everyone, whether it is a teacher, or a bus driver, or a man of arts. Every state's path is a path towards wealth. I believe that the latter is not only about commerce, but also about spirituality. With much money we don't get richer. However each painting, each movie, each music composition enriches us. Thus we become more aware of what and who we are, of what we want, and - let the pathos flow - how universe is going. I would like to end up my essay with a thought of the greatest philosopher of liberalism John Steward Mill, who said that if only one opinion is different from the others, we don't shut it up - it may be the only right one. So let them talk.
