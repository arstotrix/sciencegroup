From the chart we can see differences between quality of children in primary ages who does not go to school. The highes number of these children is in Africa in 2000 year. The lowest amount from period in the chart is in South Asia in 2012 year. They change number of educated children more than others. For boys it is about about a half of number that have been earlier. But level of not-educated primaris in South Asia in 2000 are the same that level of Africa in 2012. It is little more then 30 millions. Data from Africa far this period goes down, but stay higher then worlds level. Howerever, South Asia in 2000 have more children without access to primary school then in the world for about 20 millions. So, in 2012 this number have changed and it is less then rest of World for about five millions of children. So, it is a good trend.
