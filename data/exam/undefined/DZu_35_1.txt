The bar chart depicts how many girls and boys without access to primary education there are in the world in 2000 and in 2012.
The number of children without access to primary education decreases in every region: it is 43,7 million in 2000 compared with 32,7 in 2012 in Africa, 32,7 million and 9,9 million in South Asia and 23,3 and 15,3 million in the rest of the world relatively. The change in South Africa is most dramatic: the amount became three times less in 2012 than it was in the beginning of the century. The gender difference changes in South Asia: there is a strong strategy for shortening the absence of access to education among girls: in 2000 there were two times more uneducated girls and in 2012 the number of children of both sexes appeared almost equal.
All in all, the number of children without an access to primary education decreased in every region. Though, still there is a tendency for Asian and African countries to have issues with giving primary education to children: both girls and boys.
