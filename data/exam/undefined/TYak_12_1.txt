The two charts provide us with information about travelers to and from the UK during the last 20 years of 20 century, and places the UK residents prefer to visit. The main trend in the first chart is a stable growing of travels in both groups of British and foreigners. The line of visits abroad by British starts from 12 â€“ 13 million in the 1979 and then soars to more than 50 million in the 1999. The survey reveals, that the most popular country among travellers, visited by more than 10 million people in the 1999, is France. Spain heeps the second place with almost10 million visitors in the 1999. The other countriesare not so popular: even the USA is visited by just 3 million people.

The line of visits to the UK by foreigners also underwent a significant rise between 1979 and 1999, but not so sharp as the other line, starting at the point of 10 million in 1979, it reaches almost 30 in the 1999.
