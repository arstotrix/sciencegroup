Nowdays the environmental problem is one the most topical and vital issues for all countries. Because of the air pollution and global warming we all are in dangerous. One of the reason of such problem is air travel. Some people claim that there are a lot of unimportant air traveles, for example for business and leisure and states should decline the quantity of such traveles due to the legal fixing of it. I cannot agree with this point of view.
The opponents of my view think that if we reduce the amount of unnecessary air travel we will live in the world without pollution and global warming. However, I think that if governments introduce such law, people will use another thyps of transportation like train, busses, which are also harmfull for our environment. Air travel will decrease, but another thyps of travel will dramaticly rise.
Secondly, I think that it is very difficult to understand what travel is necessary, importand and what is not. A lot of businessmen, people would have a serious problems if we introduce such laws. New generation is very mobile. Air travel allow us to use a less time for the rood. Eventually, I consider that such law will not work.
Tu sum up, I want to say that we live in 21 century, in technical world. Of course development have terrible consiquences, but it normal. For me it is more important to manage my time, and use the way of travelling which takes less time.
