The chart shows the different levels of post-shool qualifications and the difference between man and women in Australia in 1999. The most significant difference between men and women was on skilled vocational diploma. Only 10% of women got it. Nevertheless, undergraduate diploma and bachelor's degree are more popular among women. 75% and 55% are females while males had only 35% and 50%. As you can see on the chart, postgraduate diploma and master's degree are more popular among men. I suppose that women usually get pregnant at this ages (25-35 y.o). In general I should admit that in 1999 men were more educated than women.
