Firstly, the graph shows that there are more males than females among the people with skilled vocational diploma, at the one side, and among the people with postgraduate diploma or Master's degree, at the other side. The percentage of males differed in these three categories, it reached a peak approximately at the 90 per cent in the category of people with skilled vocational diploma and then dropped to 70 and 60 per cent in both the highest categories. Secondly, the graph shows that there are more females than males among the people with middle levels of education (undergraduate diploma or bachelor's degree).
