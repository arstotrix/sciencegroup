Task 2.
   Improvement of public health in general opinion, is necessary for impovement of society in whole. But measures that should be adopted for this impovement are different. Generally, we can divide opinions into two groups: those who provide sports as the salvation and those who don’t consider sports to solve the problem and insist on other measures. Which point of view is correct? Let’s discuss them both.
   First of all, expend of sports in public lifestyle strictly depends on amount of sports facilities. Actually, an increase of number of sports facilities have an effect on publicity, for example in Russia where in last years were built many new facilities. But a raise of interest to sports became because of Universiade and Olympic Games. Public relation to sports became better not because of increasing number of sports buildings but due to supporting the country on international competitions. Briefly, this was a deserve of mass media. Sports can improve public health, but with some conditions.
   That’s why the other opinion is based on propaganda of healthy lifestyle. Moreover this point of view includes legal reglamentation of some moments that are contrast with healthy lifestyle. For example, we can see prevention measures against smoking in new laws.
   To my view all these points are right because the best effect we can reach only to adopt these measures together.
