Task 2.
   It is obvious fact that public health is getting worse under the awful factors of human activity. People suggest different methods to stop this unhappy tendency. One of those is the increasing an amount of sport facilities. As far as Iâ€™m concerned, it is not the best decision of this problem.
   Experts believe that sport makes our health more useful. People, who regularly do sports, less tend to be stressful, nervous, etc. Physical exercises can help you to feel your life and organize your time in a right way. Parents persuade their kids to do sports in order to make their life more interesting or even to full it with the meaning.
   However, I think there are a lot of other ways to support public health condition. First, you can limit time sitting in front of the computer or using your smart phones because they are harmful for our eyes and physics. Secondly, it is important what you eat. More fruits and vegetables and less oil and fast food lead you to healthy lifestyle. Thirdly, you can spend more time in fresh air, for example, wherever outside the megapolis. Moreover, you have the possibility to sleep more and go to bed + get up in one time. All these advices can help you to be more healthy.
   Overall, there are many ways to make your health better. Of course, if you will practice all methods, which were observed, you can achieve the best result.
