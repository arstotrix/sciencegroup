There is no doubt that the main value in everybody’s life is health. However, despite the accessment of health insuarance and the development of science and medicine, public health is getting worse. Someones claim that it is necessary to rise the number of sport activities at schools and universities. Others argue that this way would not dramatically change the situation and there are other methods to solve the problem.
   On the one hand, sport exercises help people to keep feet and therefore to decline the ability of having health problems. If a person does not pay enough attention to sport, it can lead to obesity and heart diseases. Moreover, sport activities provide good health and as a result people do not have to spent time on visiting doctors and washing money on different expensive.
   On the other hand, the problem with public health can not be solved only by increasing the number of sport facilities. The government should transform not education, but health insuarance system. Drinking alcohol and smoking should be forbidden not only among teenagers but also among their adults. The healthy lifestyle are required to become popular with the help of newspapers, television, the Internet and other mass media instruments. 
   To draw a conclusion, I am convinced that both view are likely to take into a consideration. In my opinion, improving public health is impossible without strong governments’ action. More than that, everyone should be responsible about his health and try reduce work pressure and to find time on sport activities.
