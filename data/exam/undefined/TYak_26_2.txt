It’s well-known that one of the most issential issues for school of many countries is that a lot of students don’t behave properly in than. In this essay I would try to understand how to deal with this problem and find out what is the reason for misbehavior of the students.

The first reason why children misbehave during the classes is that at this age they are usually very hyperactive. Moreover, they like to drink drinks that contains a lot of coffeine,  which makes them even more figity.

Secondly, most of the teachers are too strict. They don’t allow students to make any noise at all. They want students to sit only with shaight lack and with their arms as the desk. Children in such cases usually want to rebel and start behaving even worse.

All of these means that schools first of all should stop selling drinks with high coffeine  levels, so that to prevent students from being ???.

Moreoner there should be a gym in the school that students will be allowed to visit in any time. if students spend a lot of time doing sports, then they can be less achive during their classes. If teachers want to change students’ behaviour, then they also should think about their own  behaviour, too. If teachers allow students to talk a little and give them some freedom, then children will attend their classes more willengly and won’t be so reluctant.

To sum up, I strongly believe that reason of students misbehavier is that they are quite hyperactive and it’s absolutely natural. They also feel themselves like rebellions at this age and don’t to obey orders. That’s why school should do something that will make them not so active and make teacher stop acting to strict.
