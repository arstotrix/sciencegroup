According to many people belief, the biggest part of air travels is unnecessary so they should be reduced. I particularly agree with this statement, and in my essay I will explain why.
First of all, it must be noticed that influence of planes on air pollution is enormous. According to the statistics, last few years chemicals, gases and other unhealthy products in the air are the result of air-travelling, which creates a huge danger for our environment. What is more, nowadays there are a lot of different types of transport which can replace travelling by plane. For instance, people, who usually use plane to neighbour cities can use train instead, it would be much cheaper and healthier for our environmental system.
However there are some aspects, which make me disagree with this statement in some extent. The biggest problem is the traveling across water objects such as seas and oceans. There is no type of transport which can replace planes in this case. In addition, a lot of trips which are connected with business aims can not be replaced by other types of transport because of time limit, so that, laws, introduced by governments would have a bad impact on business sphere.
All things considered, I strongly believe that air-travel should be reduced in such proportion, which would not pose any social, economic and other problems for our modern society, and all laws nowadays would not have any good impact for everyone.
