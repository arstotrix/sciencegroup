I tend to disagree with the opinion. That air travelling should be reduced. Our modern world has undergone great changes recently. Global connections are nowadays a usual thing. People have business deals with partners all over the world. People prefer to spent their holiday abroad gaining new experience about foreign cultures, other nations. I held the viewpoint, that air pollution and other environmental problems should be solved with no harm to air transportation system.
Global market enforces international business communications. Despite all the development in development in technology, face-to-face interractions could not be avoided. Air travelling is the best way to set global nets for business aims. Airoplanes are cheap, fast and comfortable.
Most people prefer to go abroad during their holidays. Airplanes again provide such an opportunity. In previous times it could take month to get from Saint Petersburg to Vienna, while today, thanks to air travelling, it occupies not more than three hours.
Banning air travelling in some cases, or even reducing the amount of flights may cause dramatic challenges for businesses in particular and for the state economy as a whole. What is more, less air travel is likely to triger social unrest.
Environmental problems caused by airplanes can hardly be solved with air flights limitations. There are much more existing factors that contribute to air pollution and global warming, such as corbon monoxide produced by car fumes, waste, for example dust, from factories and so on.
To conclude, air travelling plays a great role for modern global society it could not be limited or banned without severe consequencies. At the same time, environmental issues are still here to stay. Governments should try to find out more efficient ways to deal with air pollution and warming, that would not harm people and violate their rights.
