Today schools in many countries complain about the behaviour if their students. It is a serious question which needs some solutions. I will try to think about the reasons of such a problem and find some solutions as well.

	First of all, I suppose that the reasons for bad behaviour depend on the age of the child. Students of primary schools night be too young to take control of themselves it is very hard for them to obey some strict rules, because they usually do not understand their purpose if we talk about teenage students it is obvious that they might want to break the rules to show some protest secondly, the ability to obey rules must be trained by the parents of a child. If parents cannot explain to their children that a society has some patterns of behaviour children will not be able to clear with those who surround them. 

	What solutions can I propose? Well, the first thing to   is to let parents know, if their child has some behaviour problems their duty is to explain the importance of being polite and respectful. If this does not help, I believe that psychologists should create some special games, that will help children to adapt to the social environment.

	To sum up, I would like to say that it is a quenstion if big importance, because those who are children now will become adults in a few decoder. And if a grown-up mature person con not  control himself, is rude and has no idea how to normally communicate with offers, this will become a big problem for him to find an appropriate job, to make a family etc. We should take core about carrying our children up, because if we do not, life will turn out to be a hard challenge for them.
