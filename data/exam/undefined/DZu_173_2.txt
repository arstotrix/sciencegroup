In 21 century there is a big issue with environment, air pollution is part of this problem. As many people think airplanes is the main cause of bad situation with ecology. The logical think is to prohibit a lot of air travel and use this kind of transportation only when it is really needed but not when you want it. I totally disagree with this statement.
First of all the law, due to which there will be reducing of air travel, won’t be under constitution because it breaks the rights of citizens. So there are the public interest and the private one. In this situation it should be decided what is more important. There are a lot of things in the world that pollute our nature. But government do nothing to fix it. So air travel is a private sphere so it can not be reducing. Probably it will be better to find a way to reduce air pollution from airplanes maybe some better engine.
Secondly it will be a big mistake to introduce this law because of economic reasons. Not at the same time but later government and people will see that there is no development, no success in many areas of life, especially in bussiness. The taxes that do not come from this sphere make a hole in a budget of country.
So different aspects, such as formal one – this law not under constitution and non-formal - money make the idea of reducing of flies not the best. For government better is to find a way to reduce pollution due to another law.
