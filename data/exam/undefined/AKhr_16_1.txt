The graph illustrates the proportion of different types of post-school qualifications in Australia between man and women in 1999. As we can see, only 10% of people who held skilled vocational diploma are women and 90% are men. Besides, 70% of people with undergraduate diploma are women and the rest 30% are men. The quantities of men and women with bachelor's degree is pretty the same: 55% are women and 45% are men. However, only the third of people with postgraduate diploma are women and 70% are men. Moreover, 60% of master's degree are held by men, and only 40% are held by woman. We can notice, that there no strong correlation between sex and level of qualification. Thus, basic higher education is more popular between women, but men more often have master's degree and postgraduate diploma. In conclusion, I'd like to say, that there is some important differences between men and women in the type of their post-school qualification.
