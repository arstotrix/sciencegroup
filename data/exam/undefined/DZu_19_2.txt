Today humanity thinks a lot about our world and its problems, such as global warming and pollution. Its common knowledge that different technical inventions produce cardon dioxyde which badly influence our atmosphere, some people state that the biggest part of this gas goes from planes and their amount has to be reduced.
I can’t agree with this opinion. To my mind plane is one of the most comfortable and cheap type of transport (comparing length and price). Air travel allows people to cover long distances in hours, none of other transport can show such results. Plane is also the less dangerous transport, according to the statistics the number of catastrophies is below the number of car accidents.
If we compare the amount of gas which ruins ozon layer and pollutes atmosphere that is produced on factories and plants and the gas that is produced by cars, I am 100% sure, we will see that air plane pollution is not so dangerous.
Others think air travel has to be governed more to reduce its amount as an unnecessary transport. They say that special laws should be invented so decreasing the number of planes will help with pollution and global warming.
All in all I prefer my point of view. In my opinion air planes produce not so many pollution to begin to fight against them. As it is still the most convinient and comfortable type of transport we don’t have to take people’s possibility to use it.
