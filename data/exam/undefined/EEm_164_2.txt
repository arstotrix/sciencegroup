It is believed that air travels have a harmful impact on the environment. They also think that number of flights should be reduced. I partly agree with that statement.
Nowadays, plane is one of the most popular kinds of transport. Millions of people enjoy it every day. However, there are some problems connected with jets. Firstly, planes are using a lot of fuel during their trips. CO2 goes to the atmosphere in big amounts and can cause troubles such as global warming. Secondly, travelling by plane sometimes can be dangerous. In modern history there are lots of examples of crashes in the air. The last famous one was in Rostov one week ago.
Despite problems, this sort of transport has some big advantages. Planes are faster than car and trains. Some of private ones are even as comfortable as apartments on the ground. There are few places in the world which you cannot reach without using planes because it can be dangerous. Planes are also life-needed to countries which are rising after wars or natural disasters because other governments can send food or drugs to these regions really fast.
Nowadays, our planet is in danger. Big cities are full of smog and air pollution. Clean oxygen and water may become the biggest treasure to people. Many persond do not even think about problems which they can cause by using airplanes. For example, Miami city in the USA, Florida will be under the water if global warming does not finish. Planes are one of reasons why today situation is so difficult.
In spite of fact that some people believe that our plane usage today is normal, I am sure that we should reduce the amount of air travel.
