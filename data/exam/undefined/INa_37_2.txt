Task 2.
   It is not a secret that the social health depends on many factors, including sports, education, economy, mass media and so on. There has been a serious discussions, held upon the connection of people health and massive promotion of sports facilities. I, for one, tend to suppose that sports has fundemental basement, without people are likely to become weaker, but it does not represent the main cure to make people healthier and more rigourous.
   One of the main reasons for making sports wider, listing the increasing number of sports facilities, implies the negative effect of urban lifestyle. For example, the absence of physical efforts for movement provokes the outbreak of people, suffering from obesity and heart-blood pressure. It may seem even more panic, but in fact sports helps to overcome depression and other psychological weaknesses. What is more, sports has a diversity of sections a person can make a choice, with his or her appeal towards each. Anyway, a person feel happy while playing his or her favourite game.
   Is that all tha strengthens the public health? I would argue that sports is just a one and final approach. Mass media and education should be taken into consideration with a positive sense, the progogaula of public health is compulsory, making state and private programmes effective. The society should stop economy that products junk food, with enterprenners main intentions to make profits.
   To summarise what has been said, the sports facilities are posing a positive effect on the state of social health. However, if it were for my authority, I would involve mass media into action.
