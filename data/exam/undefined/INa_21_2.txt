Improving of public health is one of the most problems for modern society. The seeking of right approach for this kind of question is a headache for scientists and social researchers.
   Firstly, it is important to say about advantages of sport, as a way of improving public health. Sport can be used for pressure, heart work, effective medicine from stomack ackes, for body coordination and so on. Moreover, today, people have free access for a plenty of sport activities. According to scientists, going in for sport escape people from nerves, which also influence on health. For example, swimming develop breath system and whole muscle system of human body. Furthermore, swimming with its permanent movement of hands and legs together helps to build good coordination.
  Opposite, to such opinion, a lot of people prefer another ways of improving health and consider sport as almost non-effective for health. Their arguements based on disadvantages of sport – a lot of trauma, too much time required for getting positive results and, of course, avoiding another methods of improving helth. For instance: vitamins, healthy food, good environment etc. This group of people suggest another and, otherwise, different ways of increasing people’s health level.
  It can be showed by this point: without healthy food person can not achieve success in sport, and in improving health indicators as heart and blood pressure.
   As to me, personally my view is that other measures are needed, including vitamins and healthy food. But to sum up, sport facilities play a really incredible role in health-building and fine health conditions of today human-being.
