Recent decades have witnessed a constant growth of travelling by air, which is a great threat for the environment. I believe that there is an urgent need for laws limiting the number of air flights in order to prevent further destruction of the ozon layer and to slow down global warming.
Firstly, planes are not the only one opportunity to travel, especially when it comes to trips for a short distance. Cars, trains and buses also provide people with a quite effective service if they need to move somewhere on the continent, and ships are really good at water-travels. While not being as fast as planes, all the other means of transportation give people an opportunity to fully enjoy the beautiful scenary and to get more interesting experiences. That’s why some air-travel-connected restrictions won’t hurt people badly, because there are lots of alternatives they can choose instead.
On the other hand, even small limitation will take away the basic right of every human to be free in terms of travelling. Governments should develop environmental-friendly planes in order to save our fragile eco-system, but not forbid people to travel the way they want. However, I personally think that both measures should be applied at the same time, because at the moment people use flights way more than it is necessary, so some limitations are justified.
In conclusion, the concern about air pollution and global warming could not be overestimated and all the people should understand how essential this issue is, so such measures as reducing amount of flights are needed to be introduced.
