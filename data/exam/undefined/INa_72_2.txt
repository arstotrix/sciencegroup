   Improving public health is said to be one of the most important aims of society. One of suggested decision is increasing the number of sport facilities. There are different opinions about effectively of this method. 
   On the one hand physical activities could influence on our public health positively and bring success in this area. Firstly public health should be provided by school and universities by holding classes of physical education. Sport would have effect on the development of children in the period of their growth. Moreover people should have an access to going in for sport. It connects with number of sport centers, bycicle roads and parks, children`s playground and others. At last but not the least, public health can be improved by holding different social sport event such as city maraphon, mass bycicle walkings, mass skating, which provide sport into the mass and all people can participate there if they want.
   On the other hand these methods can be thought is ineffective. Some people says that sport has negative influence on the health, because we lose much energy. Also method of increasing the number of sport facilities is likely to be ineffective by some people, because it requires much money. Instead of building new sport center government can give money to the decreasing of industrial pollution or greening city. These people suggest other way of increasing level of public health. A consist of improvement and development of social medicine. If people have good doctors and hospitals, it would be more positively influence on public health than sport.
   From my point of view society should keep a complex way of improving public health. And in these way should exist the place for physical activities and sport. People should an access to sport facilities, because doing sport develops our health and body. For the modern time people have not enough movement and because of it they have to go in for sport.
