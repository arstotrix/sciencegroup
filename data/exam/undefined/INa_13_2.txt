Writing Task 2.
   Nowadays the importance of sport exercises is scientifically proved. There are no doubts that people who want to keep fit and healthy have to do some sport. And goverment`s purpose is to increase the number of sports facilities. In the same time there are groups of people who strongly believe that this measure wouldn`t be so effective and other activities have to be done.
   It`s undeniable that sport significantly influences our health. Firstly, it can decrease the risk of heart-attacks in our future, protect us from over-weighting, keep us in a perfect physical conditions. Secondly, different sports facilities are the most easiest and convinient way of improving public health in every place and every time. Thirdly, for the great majority of people sports facilities are the best choise if they want to spend some time with their families or just frends. In that way sport can unite members of family, make their relationships closer and stronger.
   On the other hand, we can`t but agree that sport isn`t the only thing that people have to do if they want to be healthy. That`s why we have to consider the other point of view. Sport will have really little effect without complex of measures for improving public health. For instance, goverment has to expand non-smoking areas, prohibit any advertisement of alcohol and punish severe for sailing tabacoo for teenagers. Moreover, sport is nothing without healthy diet, so some courses have to be organized to teach people what products are use full and what food they have to avoid.
   In conclusion, it`s nessessary to outline the great role that sport plays in our life and also to mention that only in complex with  other measures it will improve public health.
