Some people believe that creative artists should be free to express their own vision of the world in any form that they want. I completely support this opinion because I believe that the Government has no right to make restrictions on that sphere.
The main evidence supporting my opinion is the fact that sometimes government prohibits some forms of art in order to manipulate mass media and prevent people from seeing something that might change their political positions. For instance, in Soviet Russia some controversial books and songs were banned because they were indicated as harmful ones. But nowdays they are free to read and listen and we found them quite thoughtful and interesting. 
Another evidence supporting my opinion is the fact that in the most cases artists reflect the reality of modern world in their works, so there is no need in restrictions cause in the future it might become a valueable source of information about people who lived in particular period of time. For example, some pictures, photos and music which were prohibited, can show the real thoughts of humanity unlike official books and newspapers.
On the other hand, some people believe that some forms of art can be not appropriate and must be banned. They claim that photos, for instance, which show naked people and some forms of violence can not reflect reality and just an useless garbage. However, I believe that even such forms of art are important because we can discover some new ways of thinking when we look at unusual things.
To take everything into account, I believe that government should not make restrictions on any form of art because only by collecting different visions from different artists we can discover true image of the world.
