   It is generally said, that the number of sports facilities influence public health. Some people claim that if we rise the number of sports equipment, the public health improves at the same time. Others do not think so. From my point of view, only increasing the number of sport facilities is not enough to rise the all health of people.
  On the one hand, building new sports centers gives us an opportunity to keep us in fit without the spending more time to go to the fitness center in the different part of the city. So, people will be healthy if they have the place near the house, when they can do some physical exercises. Also, people choose different kinds of sport and people spend more time on their health.
   On the other hand, there are people who do not like sport at all. So, the increasing number of sports centers will not influence them. So, the level of public health in that way remains steady. To improve public health we should provide also healthy lifestyle, healthy food. In that way the desire to care about the health will appear, public health will improve. 
   All things considered, there are two points of view on the problem of improving public health by increasing number of sports facilities.
