These four pie charts compare the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050. It is measured in percentage. Overall, it can be seen that by the year 2050 the population of Yemen will become younger than Italian population in the same period.
   In detail, in 2000 in Yemen there were less than a half middle-aged (15-59 years) people (about 46 %) and 50 % of young people. At the same time in Italy there was about 60 % of middle-aged citizens. That is 36 % bigger than old men (60+ years) and about 15 % bigger than middle-aged in Yemen. 
   However by the year 2050 there will be an opposite tendency. In particular, Yemen will have more than a half middle-aged people. There also will be a big amount of young people (0-14 years) â€“ 37 %. While Italy will have only 46,2 % middle-aged people and 11,5 % young people and all others (42,3 %) will be old men. It means that in the future the whole population of Yemen will be younger than in Italy.
