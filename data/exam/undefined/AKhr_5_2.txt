Nowadays, in our country are happening different political events which are closely related with the freedom of speech and the censure in the mass media and the sphere of art. The governmental regime becomes much more stricter and it allowes significantly less freedom to people to express their thoughts, opinions and ideas. Is it right or wrong? It is a good question and I will give my point of view connected with this problem. To start with, I want to say that I do not think that government restrictions on what creative artists do is a rational idea. First of all, it is obvious that such government measures can lead to protests among people inside the country because these restrictions interrupt their freedoms and rights. Most of the modern states are liberal so they just can not allow these restrictions to become real. Secondly, it must be said that when artists are restricted with something their works have no sense because they are not aible to tell the people all that they wanted to tell. The main factor that makes products of creative artists really genious is the total freedom in all that they want to do or to say. To sum up, I think that government restrictions on the freedom of speech or expressing ideas is the first step to the citizen war in the liberal society. If the state is considered to be liberal it can not allow to restrict the freedom of its people.
