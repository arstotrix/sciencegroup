Nowdays air traveling is very porpular, so a lot of people argue, that it pollutes our air and leads to global warming.Some people consider that this amount of traveling by planes our society does not need, so the goverment must reduce this amount using laws. I am partly agree with this statement and now I am going to share my point of view.
I am totaly agree with the fact that air traveling contributes to air pollution and global warming. According to the research our ozon lawer decreades more than twice since last century. But also according to this research planes is not the main reason. Manufactures and cars pollute our air much more than planes.
Moreover, I am not agree that nowdays we do not need such amount of air travel. We do need them because they have demand. People fly a lot and there must be a lot of air companies to help people with traveling. If our society did not need so much of air companies, they would not exist.
And finally I am not agree that goverment should control air companies to reduce air pollution. They should better think how to envent new type of air transport which will be ecological and will not pollute our air and will not leed to global warming.
Taking everything into consideration I should probably say, that I am partly agree with the statement and goverment should finsd another ways to save our ozon lawer or stop global warming. Making laws to reduce amount of planes is not the sollution.
