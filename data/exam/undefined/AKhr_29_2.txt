In the last decade, there has been considerably debate over the freedom of art. Some people object to that policy. However, others advocate it, arguing that freedom is extremely necessary to any kind of creation. Whilst, I believe that the both opinions have strong arguments, I consider that art should not be stopped by government restriction. Firstly, any frames kill the creation. No doubt, that some people will say that the art as freedom of making, if we ask them to give definition to it. Consequantly, it is practically the same as the freedom of speech, which is the main feature of liberal and civilized society. That is why art should not be restricted. Secondly, the policy, which frames creative people, usually just try to close the truth which they say. Perhaps those ideas could seem dangerous to the government. That is the reason of such measures. Futhermore, through the art politicians try to achieve peoples attention for giving them the ideology. However that is not art. True art is free and honest. On the other hand, it is necessary to restrict the artists sometimes. Unfortunately, these measures are necessary when we speak about the degradation of taste and unmoral ideas, which appear nowadays in modern art. However, we cannot name that true art, because true creation should make us better and influence on our mind and soul just in good way. In conclusion, I want to remember the times in the history of our country when the best creations were closed from people in 19th and 20th century. I'm totally disagree with such restrictions. I'm convinsed that art should be free and be accesable to everyone.
