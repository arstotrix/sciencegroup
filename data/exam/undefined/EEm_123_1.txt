The given bar chart demonstrates how the number of kids who don’t have access to primary education was changed between 2000 and 2012 in such regions as Africa, South Asia and Rest of World. The data is also given by gender.
As we can see from the chart, in 2000 the biggest number of children without access to primary education was in Africa. In 2012 the situation is obviously stayed the same comparing to the other regions. However, generally the number of kids who can’t get primary education decreased in all regions (from 43.7 millions to 32.7 millions in Africa; from 32.7 millions to 9.9 millions in South Asia; from 23.3 millions to 15.3 millions in the rest of the world).
So it can be seen that goverment in South Asia made a huge job decreasing the number of children without access to primary schools in almost three times. And it is also necessary to notice that goverment in Africa wasn’t so succesful.
