To begin with, I would like to say that freedom in its every meaning always was the greatest value for which people had to die, fight and struggle since the begging of humankind. The right to express your thoughts, feelings and emotions is extremly important for a modern society. So my point of view is that it is impossible to prohibate any kind of self-expression. Firstly, I think in that way because the lack of freedom may led us to a so-called "totalitary society" in which everybody are about to think, act and behave in the same way. Also in that world people will suffer from a tirany of a dictator and noone could not to supply its own point of view, all that can become a reason of the awful disasters. The examples of that situation are on the surface. Hitler and Nazi Germany, Mao Tsedung and revolutionary China, Paul Pot that killed half of popularity in Cambodia with his secret police and the book "1984" by Orwell. The cause of all that is the government trying to restrict the laws in their own interests. Secondly, in the society with firm restrictions of the freedom the art masterpieces can hardly appear. Of course it happens sometimes but still the true out masterpieces are born in free society. For example, we do not know any famous singer, writer or actor from Saudi Arabia because of its firm regime. In conclusion I'am eager to say that freedom brings happiness to the people. And happiness is what we are all trying to reach in our likes.
