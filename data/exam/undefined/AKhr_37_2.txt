Some people say that artists should have a non-limited freedom of self-expression. Others believe that it is necessary to restrict their desires to express everything they want on state level. To my mind, art should have some particular limits. First of all, literature, music and films are the most influential instruments of advertisement. Without a restrict on extremistic forms of art we are risking to get to the totalitarian society. Secondly, art helps to shape the personality. The risk of forming a person with strange or even dangerous habbits is very high. So there must be a strict distinction between the art, which brings up the best characteristics in a human being and the art, which influence the bad ones. Thirdly, artists are heavily influenced by the social surrounding, by the political situation in the country, so in their art they can excerbate it and show their state in a bad way. Nevertheless, some people believe that art should not be restricted. They claim that by setting limits for the artists, the government limit the freedom of self-expression and the freedom of speech to all people. I cannot agree with this statement as by restricting the art, the government provide other people with guarantee, that no extrimistic, dangerous and strange literature, music or film will not influence the citizens of the country and their children. All in all, the government should set up all conditions for artist to allow them to create in the way they want. At the same time, the government must restrict the art, which can be dangerous, or have dangerous influence on citizens.
