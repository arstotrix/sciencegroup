Nowadays there is a huge problem of global enviromental pollution. People from all over the world try to take govermental attention to the issue of air pollution. They believe that government should control the number of air travelling. I totally agree with this statement.
First of all must be said that air pollution can lead to huge range of problems and disasters. We can already see global warming, which is bad for animals, humanity and nature. One of the cause of it is air pollution. We can avoid it if government take necessary measures to limit travelling by air. For example they can introduce law that would control owners of private airplanes, so they will have a limit of flyings.
The other bad side of uncontrolled air travelling is that there is a dramating and scaring increase of air crushes. It is no more surprise if me turn the TV on and see the news that airplane had fallen. Government should take serious care about this problem. In addition must be said that nowadays young people prefer extream travelling. They can easily take airplane and fly around the city and sometimes jump from it.
There is othe point of view. Some people believe that humanity has much more important issue that we need to focus on. For instance, one of such problems is poverty in many of african countries.
To sum it up I must say that people from all over the world should pay more attention to this problem, while we can solve it. Our future life is depends of it.
