The graphs show changes in percentage of different age groups of Yemen and Italian population from 2000 to 2050.
   According to first diagramm, half of Yemenâ€™s population in 2000 was children 0-14 years old. The people aged 15-59 years consisted 46.3%, while the oldest age group reached only 3.6%. The situation in Italy rather different. Young persons 15-59 years old have a maximum percentage of Italian population. Children have a minimum percentage, 14.3% and people aged 60 and over years old consisted 24.1%. The next graphs illustrate predictions for 2050. The number of Yemen young people aged 15-59 years will increase under 58%. However, the number of old people will not rise a lot. By 2050 in Italia will increase population of old people to 42.3%, while the percentage of other two age groups will dramatically fall.
   Overall, the predictions for Yemen and Italia are not the same. In Yemen the biggest part of population will be young generation. Italia has a trend to increase older part of population.
