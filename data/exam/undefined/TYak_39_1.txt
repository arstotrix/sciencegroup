The line graph and a bar chart provide a data about travel to and from the UK, and about the most popular routes for tourists from the UK. There is an upward trend in a line graph.

	A closer look at the line graph reveals that the number of visits abroad was almost the same with the number of visits to the UK by overseas residents, the number was about 10 – 12 millions of visitors. In 1979 however, figures started to rise slowly, by the year 1984 the number of visits abroad by UK residents grew to 20 million, while the number of visits to the UK only reached 12 – 13 million. After 1985 the number of trips alone by UK residents started to grow rapidly, and reached its peak in 1999 with the 53 million visits. The number of visits t the UK also began to grow after 1985 – 1986. But a little bit slowlier. Between 1989 and 1999 this number rose from 20 million up to 28 million at the end of this period.

	A bar chart shows us the most popular destinations for UK residents in 1999. It is clear that a Spain and a France are leaders, the number of tourist who prefer to visit these countries is about 10 million.
