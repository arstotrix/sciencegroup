Travelling by air can cause some problems with our ecology. To prevent it, the government should prohibit some of the travels by air.
To start with, business travels require very fast routes, especially opulent business executives use planes to reach the destination fast. Moreover, government made their business too. For instance, Russian president have to use planes to fly very long routes in case of the emergency accedents. As for result, he often needs to travel by air. 
In contrast, it has become a fashion for people to use air ways even for a very short distance. Air transportation systems are using a large portion of world’s reserved fuel and affecting the environment by polluting in. so restriction should be applied in these cases. For example: if a destination takes a person only 1-2 hours in road then the the idea of travelling through air is rather pointless and could be a big problem. Followed by this case, government should apply strict rules to aviation companies that they must distinguish a true business executive and a tourist and give the business person the option to travel through the air and encourage the tourist to take an alternative route.
In conclusion, there are many means of travelling nowadays: by train, by bus, by car, etc… So, there is no need for all people to use planes so often. The air companies should co-operate with government to create an effective air laws, which will help to reduce the pollution effect.
