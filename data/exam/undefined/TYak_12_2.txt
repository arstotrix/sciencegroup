Nowadays it is commonly agreed, that pupils in different countries tend to misbehave a studying process. Experts now offer the possible causes of this, make predictions about now it can end and discuss how to avoid the disobedience. Let’s take a quick look on this problem.

	Firstly, student’s misbehavior is a consequence of a school democracy, which gives pupils a wide range of possibilities for self-expression and a great liberty of behavior as well. Children aren’t able to control themselves and the rules of the discipline if they are not forced to do this. Too mild rules and the lack of adults’ control trigger to misbehavior and disobedience.

	On the other hand, too severe rules and punishments in schools also cancan cause un pleasance and cvena riot amond students. In this case, it is very important to find “the golden measure” in administrative rules and demands to satis by pupils and hold a strong discipline as well. Student shouldn’t be afraid of it, but they should know, that misbehavior always causes punishment – this will make them respect the rules. The possible consequenses of a school disobedience are more important, than this can seem. Children don’t learn to take responsibility on their behaviour and things they do, don’t learn to respect adults and other children, common rules of discipline – and this can’t make a real citizen out of a child. Government and school administration should pay more attention on how students behave during the lessons and between them, teach them obedience, so pupils can develop responsibility and respect for powers since childhood.
