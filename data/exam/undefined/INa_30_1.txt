These charts amounts of the total population in relations to percentage belonging to different three age group in two countries. It also estimates trends up to 2050.
   A closer look at the data reveals that the percentage of the elder people is high at all times. Following this, the most of population of Yemen is represented by the young group 10-14 years with nearly 50 %. On the other hand the same group in Italy was covered only 14,3 % in 2000. The amount of adults in two countries is approximately the same with difference just about 10 per cent. The group of 60+ years people in Italy … six times this rate in Yemen with 24 % and just under 4 per cent.
   Projections up to 2050 indicate that this trend is likely to continue with the steady increase in the third age group which is represented by the people. In Yemen the amount of children will be dramatically declined, while in Italy the same trend will be roughly maintained the same level. Different processes we can see in relations to the second group of adults. There will be the small increase from 46 % to 57 % in Yemen, whereas in Italy the total amount of adults fell from 61 % to 46 %.
   Overall, we can notice a direct link between the countries’ geogrfical position and its ages groups of population mainly the rate of borness. Also the main trend is an increase of the amount of old people and decrease in the rate of children.
