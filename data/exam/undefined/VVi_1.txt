As  we can see at this chart, the largest difference in 1999 in proportion of skilled vocational diploma.  We can see that more men then women approximately in nine times. In other points difference is not so big, so undergraduate diploma women more then men only in two times. Also “bachelor’s degree“ point is almost equal point, there are approximately 50 percent men and women. In other points we can see the different situation, number of men is bigger then number of women. So, in 1999 in Australia 30 percent of postgraduat diploma were women and 70 percent were men. So, in last point “Master’s degree” we can see that men again more then women, in 1,5 times, in this time. 
So, at this chart we can see that in Australia majority of people, who had post-school qualifications and who held them in 1999 were men, but differens between number and number of women was not so big at all in this case.
