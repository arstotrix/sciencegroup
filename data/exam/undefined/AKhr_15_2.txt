The art is an essential part of our life. More and more human beings start taking it not only as a hobby but as a job. Some people believe that their works should be under government's control. Others do not support this idea. In my opinion, there should not be any restrictions for artists nowadays. First of all, if the creators are under control, they feel confused because they cannot do everything they want. As a consequence of this, the country can lose some great works and stop developing in this sphere of art. What is more, if artists are not able to create what they like, they will be depressed as they do not get any satisfaction from their life. As a result, people of this kind can easily start losing their talent and become just ordinary ones. As opposed to the above ideas, some people claim that the freedom of the expression in art should be always framed. They claim that the works sometimes are not appropriate to the society. So, people will not understand them and even get shocked. Furthermore, if there are not any restrictions, artists can offend some people such as celebreties, officials or someone like that. However, every work can be valued in it's own way. That's why government should not take any attention at what creative people do because it's just the way they live and express their points of view. To sum up, I strongly believe that artists should have a freedom in the way they create something because it is impossible to become an amazing world-wide known person as the government always  takes a control on him.
