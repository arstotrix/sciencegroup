Task 1. 
   These four pie-charts illustrate population of different ages in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050.
   Firstly, number of children (0-14 years) in Yemen in 2000 is 50,1 %. This group of age takes first place in this pie-chart. While, number of children in 2050 will fall (37,0 %, respectibaly). Next category is 15-59 years age group. In 2000 middle age has 46,3  %. In 2050 the populations of Yemen middle age people increase (from 46,3 % to 57,3 %). Thirdly, is a group of 60+ years. In the percentage of old people more than one percent (from 3,6 to 5,7 %, respectebily).
   Next is the populations of Italy while in a future, this group will have 46,2 %. People, who are 15-59 years old, have the higest number of the populations     (61,6 %).
   Children (0-14 years) taken lowest place in this diagram (14,3 %). The projections for 2050, children will have 11,5 %. Old people (60+ years) have     24,1%. Nevertheless, in 2050 this category will have 42,3 %. The difference between middle and old age will be near 4% (46,2% and 42,3 %) in 2050.
   To sum up, it seems that middle age (15-59) is a leader in all these pie-charts. What is more, number of people, who reach 60+ years, steady increase since 2000 to 2050.
