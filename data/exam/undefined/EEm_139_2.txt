Nowadays it is a well-known fact that air travel contributes greatly to air pollution and global warming. It is argued that a big number of air travels is unnecessary and that the ammount of travelling by air for business and leisure have to be governmentally reduced. Anyway, as it is an ambiguous issue and due to the lack of opportunity to give the only right answer which reveals the need in futhermore detail analysis, I am going to include it in my essay.
In my own consideration, air travel should not be governmentally reduced due to itâ€™s significance for the international business, economical and culture connections. Those who support the idea of governmental reduction of air travel often talk about air pollution and global warming, but a better idea could be just to develope alternative eco-friendly kinds of fuel which could solve the problem of negative influence of air travel using current technology without any harm to the connections between the countries. Others can consider that the humanity now have no possibility of implementation of eco-friendly technologies in air travel. It could be a strong argument as now we can not see any means of air transport using alternative sources of energy.
Anyway, the humanity now developes with a high speed and we can suppose that one day this problem would be solved by implementing of new technologies.
To conclude, the governmental reduction of air travel is not the best idea to reduce the ecological problems due to the significant importance of it for economical and cultural relationships. Also, we can see a good alternative way to solve it implementing new technologies into air travel which would be more eco-friendly.
