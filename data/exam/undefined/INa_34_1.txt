Task 1.
   The pie charts show age changing of Italy and Yemen citizens between 2000 and 2050.
   There was half of Yemen population in 2000 which included children under 15, over 50 years, it is predicted that the percentage of this group will fall down to     37 %. In contrast, there will be more teens and adults (15-59 years); the number of this group will rise over 10 %.
   The different situation is expected in Italy. The middle-age group will be a little bit smaller because of the decrease from 61,6 % to 46,2 %. Moreover, the percentage of elderly people (60+ years) will be twice more in 2050 than in 2000. An amount of children is going to fall from 14,3 % to 11,5 %.
 All in all, there are two different tendencies in Yemen and Italy. The population of Arabian state will be younger in 2050. Elderly people or 60 will be the greatest group in that European state as the statistics show.
