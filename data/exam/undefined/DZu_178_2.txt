In modern world where too many different types of polluting factors exist the problem of global warming is getting more and more important and especially air fumes. So there have to be some measures how to reduce the amount of pollatants in nature.
Personally, I strongly agree that government must intervent in that sphere. There must be some kinds of law which would create rules how to live further and punishments for violatrons of that rules. But I disagree that the authorities should interrupt and own the order how the business and people exist. The practise is that busines and people need air transport in extent that it exists. So that that would be unfair to them, unfair to take decision that people do not wont to be introduced.
In that case there are some other measur which can be undertaken by the government. First of all it is a good idea to invent and environmental friendly type of fule, which While using it would not exhaust such harmfull fumes for atmosphere. Secondly, the more complicated variant but still realistic to bring to life is creating a new type of air transport, as for example, electricity car are an analogue for common one. Last but not least is propaganda through the residents about the harm of air transport overusing and its danger consequences to pur environment.
All in all the conclusion is that government doesnot should destroy the existing order of things how people work and live. Authorities have to pay attention on the analogues to that types of travelling.
