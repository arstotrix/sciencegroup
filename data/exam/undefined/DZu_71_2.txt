Contemporary world is facing with a problem of environmental health, in which air travel has made a great contribution. However flights are seemed to be the most popular way of transport, states should decrease the number of travels by creating special laws.
Air travel as a fact is harmful for the nature for some reasons. Firstly, the pollution that a plane produce reflects rising of air temperature and cause a green house effect. Global warming, in this case, influences a daily life of the humanity. For instance, an increasing temperature had made a whole community in Alyaska to reloccated its residental area as the ice on the bank of the sea melted. Secondly, fuel for the air travellings requires too many natural resources to be used. It is also made a harmful effect on the global environment.
At the other hand, some opinion is claimed that this mean of transport os one of the most comfortable and the most rapid one. People are able to reach a necessary point on the map practically in no time, while trains, for example, move slowly.
Despite the idea mentioned above, travelling by planes is far more ecological unfriendly than other way of transports, and for this reason laws which reduce the amount of flights should be made up by governments. There is a bright idea to ban scientists, who are working on global warming issue, to flight at the professional meetings and offer them to use Skype conferense instead.
Overall, the problem of air pollution provided by air travel is significant and needs to be taking in account by the government. Special restrictions for some groups of people are one of the possible solutions.
