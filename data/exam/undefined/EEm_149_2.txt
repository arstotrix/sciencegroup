In recent years, air travelling is becoming more and more popular. However, it pollute the environment and lead to global warming. As a result some people think that it is necessary to make new laws, which will reduce the number of air travel. So personal air travel becomming an issue.
On the one hand, I agree. Planes pollute the environment, so some restrictions have to be made. If government implement laws, people will travel by air only if they have big necessity. Moreover, laws can help to reduce number of flights, since nowadays a lot of planes travel half-full.
On the other hand, I disagree. There are a lot of other types of travelling, such as travel by bus, car or train. They also pollute atmosphere and maybe even more then planes. In my opinion, people will still travel for business and leisure, so introducing new laws will not solve the problem. In addition, lately it is become popular to have family in one city, but live in another, so for those people introducing air travel laws would be a huge problem, since it will be hard to visit families. Another reason, why I disagree that it is necessary to introduce new laws is that airplane companies will start loosing money, if people will stop travel. Obviously, this will impact price of airtickets, so travelling by air will become very expencive, even if you have to travel because of emergency.
In conclusion, I would like to say that I am in two minds about this problem. It is obviuos that “green” issue of air travel is important and people have to avoid global warming. But it is seems to me that introducing laws is not the best idea.
