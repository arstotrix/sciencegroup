The bar chart depicts information about children, who have no access to primary educational courses in the regions they live by gender types.
It can be clearly seen that this information is structured by the three main world regions (Africa, South Asia and rest of world) in 2000 and 2012 year.
Referring to the number of children in Africa, girls kept the greatest percentage of the whole number of children without some primary level in studing, making 23.7 and 18.2 millions in 2000 and 2012 year correspondingly. The percentage of boys in the same ratio was made up approximatelly 20 millions in 2000  and 14.5 millions in 2012.
The South Asia region showed the great difference between numbers of children in both years. The male group was counted by 11.1 and 5.1 millions in 2000 and 2012 respectively, while the female group was just under the level of 22 and 5 millions in the same time period.
And the last region, which led the third place in the undereducated level illustrated that in both years, the structure of men and women was approximately equal (50 per cent by girls and 50 per cent by boys in 2012; and 12.8 and 10.5 millions by girls and boys correspondingly).
