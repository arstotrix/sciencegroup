Air travelling is not ecologically friendly because airplanes pollute air and increase global warming. That is why goverment have to reduce the number of unnecessary flights. I strongly agree with this statement.
Firstly, planes and helicopters are really not ecologically friendly. The amount of exhaust which is thrown right in atmosphere is catastophic. If we want to breathe clean air, government should reduce the number of flights.
Secondly, the statistics shows that every second tourist uses plane as a main transport. If this number will be decreased twicely, the world will have much more clearer atmosphere.
However, some say that plane is the most convinient transport for international business trips. That is because it is the fastest, the most comfortable way of transportation between different parts of the world, and banning of flying will be a problem for business.
Nevertheless, there are a lot of opportunities for planes in business sphere, if the trip is not intercontinental. If the distance is not too far trains can be used as effective as planes.  Of course if you need to get 3000 km away it is logically to use plane, so it is not unnecessary trip.
To sum up I would like to say that plane is the most popular transport for leisure and business, but it has a lot of disadvantages for the ecology. And the gouvenmet should indicate laws to reduce the amount of unnecessary flight, but also produce the alternatives for it. The same time, if the air trip is really needed and cannot be realised by other form of transport, it should not be banned anyway.
