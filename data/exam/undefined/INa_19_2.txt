Writing task 2.
   The public health should be considered as primary concern for not only ordinary citizens but government also. The sport facilities, in my opinion, is the easiest way to improve public health because taking regular exercises can helps to decrease the number of heart diseases which is one of the most widespread cause of death, Also the sport facilities help to reduce the expenses on health services because people who take regular exercise the suffer from diseases less than people who don’t take the exercise. Unfortunately, health of a modern man depends on many factors as environment, stress, food and water that is why it is so important to be in shape to reduce the chance of getting sick. But it is not only about being fir but also «healthy educated». It is really important to start education of being healthy in schools starting from elementary. Sure there is a possibility that the sports facilities will be used not by majority but by the minority. And some people say that the access to the sport facilities will be limited, for example, by the time or location. I consider that people should make choices on they own. If the do that the wish of being and staying healthy will not depend on conditions of the public facilities. It is impossible to make a man do what he doesn’t want to do. As i said before the sport facilities are the easiest way to improve the public health. However it is really important issue so it is better to use all possible ways to improve the public health because state needs healthy people, citizens are the main «tresure» of state that is why the government must provide its citizens with all important facilities including sports facilities.
