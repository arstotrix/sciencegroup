	Nowadays, there are many problems with pupils’ behaviour at school and because of it there are many opinions about who is responsible for it and how to avoid such situations. 

	First, it is necessary to decide what is the cause of bad student bahaviour. On the one hand, it can be some problems in family or bad bringing up, for example, if in some family rude communication is normal, children in society will behave as they like as they want, without looking at some rules and sometimes even laws. But only family and parents can be the reason of problems with people’s behaviour. It can be some personal characteristics or features. A student can behave bad or illegal because for him or for her, it is difficult to be in society and communicate with other people, so they try to save themselves in such a strange way. Moreover, the cause of behaviour problems, can be some stressful or unusual situations in student life. If a student has argued with friends or parents his or her mood will be awful and in this case a student will need to find another way to give agression, to lose bad emotions and feeliings, so usually it is expressed in behaviour. Further more, if it is a high school student, lack of sleep or unhealthy lifestyle can cause bad mood, fatigue and agressive, unusual behaviour. How this problems can be decided? If problematic behavior takes place at school, teachers should first try to understand the reason of it and after that punish person, because if they take some punishment without student’s blame it can cause another problems in future. It is very important to know the causes of people actives because sometimes it seems that a person isn’t good and if you try you can help such people to do their best.
