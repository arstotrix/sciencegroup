primary education by region and general during the period from 2000 to 2012.
It is clearly to see that it is similar percentage of boys and girls in Africa in 2000. Nevertheless, as you can see in the end of 2012 the number of children decrease in general.  However, it had the same percentage with South Asia in 2000. There is no a big deal of difference between the Africa in 2012 and South Asia in 2000. Going to Rest of World we should admit that general number of children felt down on ten percent.
According to the chart we can see that in general the percentage of without access to primary education become lower than in 2000.  From my point of view it is good illustration of effective education program which is really work, so it is a great oportunity for children to get education in the future.
