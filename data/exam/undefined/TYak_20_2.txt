Nowadays education is one of the most important parts of everyone’s lives, especially of young generations. Unfortunately, not every student agrees to study in a proper way and don’t follow the rules of the educational process. To my mind, there are some reasons of this a solutions to solve this problem. I’d like to describe some of them.

First of all, the main cause of students’ bad behaviour is problems in the family. Some troubles with relationships with relatives or other natives can distract young people from studyings. If a child is in bad terms with his family, or possibly even doesn’t have it, it can influence on his behaviour a lot. This problem can be solved by using the help of psychologists, who can ask a student about his worries in a scientific way.

Another possible reason of severe problems with student behaviour is student’s relations with classmates. Because of some personal qualities, like rudeness or self-unconfidence, some children can’t get along with others, they have no friends. They begin to protect themselves from others, showing out to everyone that they can do whatever they want. As far as I am concerned, one of the most usefull solutions can help to bring up a student who knows how to behave himself in a society.

All in all, there are a great amount of possible reasons which can make a young person behave himself in a bad way, the causes are always very personal. However, schools are able to influence on students and help them to go over the problems.
