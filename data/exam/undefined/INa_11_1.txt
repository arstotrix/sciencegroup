Task 1.
   The charts provide information regarding the ages of the populations in two countries, namely, Yemen and Italy. Both the charts also make predictions about these subjects for 2050.
   A more detailed look at the population of Yemen reveals that these were a lot of people, who are less then 60 years old (96,4%) in 2000. However, over 50 years these figures is expected to change. By 2050 the number of middle years people will have increased and will have accounted for 57,3 percent. At the same time the proportion of eldery people is also predicted to rise and will be slightly less then 6 percent.
   As for Italian people, in stark contrast to Yemen, the percentage of people, who were 15-59 years old, was significantly more than others ageing groups. In 2000 it was approximately 62%, whereas young people and eldery people constityte 24,1% and 14,3%, In the other hand, as for predictions about future, we see another tendency, not similarly to Yemen. The number of eldery people will have increased significantly form 24,1% to 42,3% by 2050, while the figure regarding 15-59 years old is predicted to fall dramatically to 46,2%.
   Overall, information on the vary ageing groups in Yemen and Italy shows that countries had different proportion in the past, but they will have similar tendency in the future.
