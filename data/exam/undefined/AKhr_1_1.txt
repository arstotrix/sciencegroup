The graph illustrates us the main trend in the level of post-school qualifications in Australia distinguished by the gender in 1999. We can see that the skilled vocational diploma difference by gender is extremely significant. Only 10 per cent of such diploma are held by females, thus we can see a great dominance of one gender at this level of qualification. Undergraduate diploma and Bachelor's degree are the only one level of post-school qualifications where femails have a larger per cent than males, it's about 70% for the first case and 55% for the second one. In the last twosamples, postgraduate diploma and Master's degree, the per cent of femails is just about a half. Overall we can say, that the percentage of females represented on the different levels of post-school qualifications is rather lower than males and the most popular qualification for femails is undergraduate diploma. And in general, femails are not that interested in very high qualification as males are (but still technical qualification is mostly spread among males and about 90%).
