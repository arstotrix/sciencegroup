Nowadays relationship between creative artists and government are becoming more and more difficult in Russia. Some people protect artists and their freedom to express their ideas while others claim that it is important to control and even restrict their activity. From my point of view, creative artists should be free to express their ideas. First of all, you can not restrict the inspiration. Some people use acts to express their opinion while artists use words, pictures, music or film. In our country we should start trust people and give them freedom to have their own opinion and express it. The way artists do that is the most beautiful and impressive. Nevertheless, I think it is important to follow the moral rules. Some years ago I saw film about children in porno-industry on TV. The main idea of the film was to protect other children and their parents but the way the producer did it was disgusting. Artists should keep in mind that their works have big influence on people. To sum up, I should admit  that it is a controversial question but I still believe that in general artists should not be restricted by the government. Even if the work is bad, people would restrict it more and government don't have to take part in it.
