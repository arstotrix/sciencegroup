Task 1.
   The following charts present the information concerning various age groups in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and future expectations by the year of 2050.
   As we can see, the percentage of older people over 60 years old in Yemen is strikingly small comparing with the same age group in Italy: 3,6 % against 24,1 %. Nevertheless, due to the future projections, the percentage of this category in both countries will slightly grow. When it comes to grown-ups, the situation is more different. People of this age group are more likely to decrease in Italy, but there is an undoubted growth in Yemen.
   Talking about children, the percentage of this group is about 50 % in Yemen which is practically the same as future predictions for Italy where both children and older people make about 53 %. Still, the percentage of children in Yemen is going to decrease by the year 2050. Anological situation is in Italy where the amount of children has a tendency to decrease.
   To sum up, we can highlight the tendency for growing-ups to take the leading position in projections even if that means some long-term decreases nowadays.
