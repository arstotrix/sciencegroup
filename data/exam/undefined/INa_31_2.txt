Nowadays, the health problem is under discussion and demands a solution. That is why some people suggest that the using the number of sports facilities changes the situation in a better side while others think in different way. So, who is right? As for me, I stand for the second point of view.
   On the one hand, the one more possibility to do sports attracts more people. All I all, people are expected to visit new-opened sport clubs, gyms, atlent exercise classes. As a result the health of population are going to improve. What is more, the achievements of the Olympics inspire the youngsters on doing sports that makes the governments to build new sport buildings. 
   On the other hand, it is worth doing something more that just increasing the number of sport facilities. I mean other areas, such as medicine, for example. I do believe that in order to improve public health the governments should invest in new medicine developments and make them available for common people. What is more, it is important to make people understended the benefits of sports through agitation and mass media. At last it is too important to show a real example of healthy men. I mean, if children see a man or woman who is overweight and proposauds the healthy way of life, they do not believe him/her.
   To draw a conclusion, I am endined to believe that the increasing the number of sport facilitiec can have a positive effect on public health, however the governments and society should do something else.
