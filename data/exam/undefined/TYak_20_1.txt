The charts illustrate the frequency of visits to the UK made by people from other countries and the frequency of going abroad by English people. This information is also supported by the data of most popular places which UK residents visit.

Until 1987, the amount of trips to England made by overseas residents remains stable, it was about 10-12 millions visits. After this year, the number of people coming to the UK was rising up to the 1999, when it reached the level of about 28 millions visits.

Almost the similar situation was with the frequency of going abroad by the UK residents. Since 1987 to 1999, the amount of visits to other countries became higher and in the end of this time period it was 52 millions visits. Over 10 millions english men visited France in 1999, about 9 millions went to Spain. Non-european countries weren’t so popular, only 3 millions visited Turkey.

All in all, the popularity of travelling is rising with the years, so the amount of people going abroad don’t remain stable.
