It was approved that air travel causes air pollution and rising of the temperatures in the world. Many people consider that governments should claim about the decreasing of travelling in the air for business and leisure. I completely agree with this idea.
In my opinion, there are too many useless flights which can be decreased and declined. For instance, the flights to warm countries in summer time have double-increase compared to winter time. It causes a great air pollution. That is why laws should forbidden the huge number of flights and let only the definite number of flights in each period to combine the possibilities for people to have a rest and decrease air pollution. Moreover, there are a lot of private planes which fly almost without the governmentsâ€™ permission and cause the huge air pollution. Such planes should be also forbidden to fly more than certain times which will be claimed in laws.
However, many people support the opinion about the free life of every person and that everybody can do whatever they want and fly where they want without time limit. But they forget about the huge causes of such freedom - air is being polluted and causes a lot of problems for human beings and our children.
To sum up, the number of flights must be controlled to protect our world and us from enormous problems which connect with global warming and air pollution. We can change the situation.
