Some people think, that art can not be regulated by government. Other people are sure, that authorities have a right to restrict the freedom of artists to obtain stability in the society or to defend some moral rules. In this essay I will try to express my own opinion on this interesting problem. On the one hand, people have a right to express their own opinion in all situation. Freedom of speech is one of the important components of modern democratic society. The restriction of this freedom is typical for totalitarian states. Thus, in nazist Germany, many artists were arrested, because their art seemed "inadmissible" for Hitler's government. This way of regualion is undemocratic: I think, that all people schould have the right to critisize their own government or to create books (or pictures, or music) which is opposed to the current policy of the state. On the other hand, sometimes art can humilate. For instance, "funny" pictures with Mohammed's face in one of the european magazines in 2008 humiliated muslim's religious believs. Mental damage can be very serious and I think, that artists don't have a right to humiliate other people. In my opinion, the right to express your own ideas is not absolute. Every artist should understand the results of his (or her) words. In the situation of serious potential damage government can restrict the freedom of speech. In conclusion, I'd like to notice, that art is very powerful instrument to influence on people's behaviour, attitudes and mood. In difficult situations government has a right to restrict the freedom to express ideas, if this make people happier.
