The topic of a bad behavior in schools is really relevant in all centuries, especially now, when almost everyone is foreed to get an  education. There are plenty of severe problems starting with a bad way of teasing lessons but what are the roots of such ways of behaviour?

	The most obvious cause that immediately comes to mind is the social back round of the kid. A lot of bad – behavied children come from families where parents do not keep an eye on their child or even from families where the kid do not have parents. Such “street” boys and girls make their own rules to every sphere of live, including the education. The phenomenon of the bad company (friends) also plays a big role.

	Another reason that cause bad behaviour is the massive violence on TV and on the  Internet. The scientists have proved that children who watch TV for a long period of time every day become more aggressive. The same goes for online games where boys usnally enjoy killing computer creatures.

	Finally the discipline in the class is all in the hands of teachers. Some of them have a low demand for pupils so children start to manipulate with teachers.

	What can we do to stop the severe problems in behavior according to the found causes? First of all, there should be done great changes in schools. Children should only be teached by teachers who can control pupils. In addition, children should spend less time with the TV and the computer and more with books. But we should admit, that in most cases there is nothing to do with pupils’ behavior because the type of behaviour has already been established by family and circumstarees by the time the child entered the school.

	All in all, there are lots of causes of bad behavior in school, but in most cases the child cannot be changed so the power of control should be in the hands of schools’ worhers.
