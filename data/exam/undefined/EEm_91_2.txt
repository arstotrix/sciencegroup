Nowadays, air travelling is very popular in many countries. There is a belief that a huge number of flights will cause air pollution and global warming, and governments should control and reduce the amount of air travelling. I disagree with statement, and main causes of my point of view will be written in this essay.
Firstly, I think that air travelling is not a real reason of global problems such as air pollution and global warming because the number of air flights is much less than number of personal cars, which have a greats bad influence on the atmosphere.
Secondly, the aircrafts don’t pollute the air veru much because the plane doesn’t spend much fuel exactly in the period of flying. Modern planes spend a lot of fuel just in the period of going up, this is the effect of ecological policy of modern countries.
Besides, the modern trend of travelling could not be stopped by the government, and nobody can stop air pollution. Some people think that if flight will be canceled, the world will be better. I partly agree with it, but there is a problem - it is difficult to make it in a real life.
Also, I would like to add to my point that governments’ regulation can lead to a reducing of level of happinese. And world leaders can have really big problems with their citisens.
To sum up, there are a lot of arguments, which can help to agree or disagree with the given statement but the fact is that air travelling have an influence on air of our planet and this pollution can not lead to a serious global problems in the nearest time.
