The chart presents the difference between the proportions of men and women who got various qualification levels after the school. The data was collected in Australia in 1999. First of all, we should mention that the biggest difference in proportion belongs to the skilled vocational diploma. Only 10% of applied people are male. In comparison to previous instance, the situation alternates by the undergraduate diploma and Bachelor's degree. Females dominate in the number of applied student sphere. Almost twice more male students than female got a postgraduate diploma. However, we can see that proportion of men and women held a Master's degree leveled off. And the difference is only 20%. Overall, in 3 of 5 presented post-school qualification levels more males than females hold the diploma or got a degree.
