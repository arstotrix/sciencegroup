Air travel is one of the most important kinds of transport. In order to economy the time, people all over the world prefer planes to trains and other transport. In my opinion, it is not unnecessary a lot of air travel because of the fact of growing economy.
Air travel is very useful for humanity, because of its speed and comfort. Nowadays a growing number of people has not only business or work in different parts of our planet, but also family, relatives or friends. It is necessary for such people to get to work or meet their family on time. If we would introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel, we could face to face with falling of economy and other problems.
Dispite above argument, I agree with opinion that air travel has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution. But I prefer the thought that it should be introduced some new planes, which would be better and would not be the reason of pollution. So scientists and goverments should spend more time trying introduce new mechanisms, not the laws.
In conclusion, I can say, despite the fact of air pollution by airplanes, airtravel is the most comfortable, useful and speedy transport for a lot of persons all over the world. We can not finish flying on planes, but we can introduce this kind of transport for best.
