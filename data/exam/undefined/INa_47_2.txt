Task 2.
   Health of the nation is an actual issue for every country in the world. Part of the specialists are tend to think that sport is the only decision for this problem. Besides, the others believe that there are plenty of different factors effect on national health and the development of sport is not the main solution.
   On the one hand, sport events and popularisation of sport should be quite useful for situation with health in country in general. For example, they can dicrease the popularity of video games among the youngth. As a result, people will love sport and keep feet from their childhood. Moreover, sport activity sometimes helps disabled or injured men better than traditional medicine using expensive treats.
   On the other hand, the ecological situation and national habits can effect on public health too. For issue, govermental policy of industrialisation can make all public sports event inefficient because of the problems with environment caused by building of new factories. In addition to this, bad habits such as fast-food or smoking can cause more damage for health than all public sports usefulness in the country. Therefore, if the bad habits are widespread, there will be more negative effects than benefits from sport.
   To my mind, the goverment should have complex view of development of public health in the country. Both organizing public sport events and agitation against bad habits are useful and efficient. If the govermental policy concers only one factor, there will be a danger from the others. To summarise, only a complex program of supporting public health will be efficient under the modern circumstances.
