Globalisation in today’s world taking a great place and sometimes it gives benefits and sometimes it causes damage to our world. As airplanes have been invented, it became so much easier to get to the other part of the world within only 24-hour period.
There are argument which making airplanes not so perfect and great. One of them is that there is fuel in airplane which causing a great damage to the enviromnent and also boosting up process of global warming. Because of too many flights taking place every day all over the world, the bad and harmful effects of air pollution by planes are summarising turning into sinergy. Governments of different countries are trying to solve this problem by reducing amount of travels with help of the law. And first who will suffer from that laws will be civilians and businessman. To my mind, it is a little hursh and unfair because the person who works 11 monts a year deserve to go to other country or to other part of the world on his vocation.
On the other hand, business trips are important because if businessmen wouldn’t go to theese trips, it would lower their profits in the long-run and consequently it would lower GDP of the whole country. Moreover, people without vocation would be devastated and as a result would work less effectively what would cause lowering GDP again.
All in all, lowering flight’s number wouldn’t solve the bigger problem. What can solve such problem, in my opinion, is inventing a new eco-friendly sourse  of energy that will allow to avoid pollution and global warming.
