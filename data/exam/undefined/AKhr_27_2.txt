There are a lot of issues in political and social agenda nowadays. One the most interesting, discussing and important question is the question about the freedom to express ideas by creative artists. Everybody understands that ideas have different content from creating brave new world to destroing moral. It is useless and dangerous products of artists. That's why government should censore the artist, some people say. Others disagree with this position and claim that creative artists may express their own idea everywhere, everywhen in whichever way they wish. I personally agree with the second point of view. First of all, I would like to say that nobody must not stop the artist when he or she creates novels, pictures, music of film. This is a right to express your own opinion though culture which is contained in every Constitution of the Western World. Secondly, the creative artist is a person who proclamates views of society where he or she was born and where lives at the moment. Artists create the product which society use to satisfate their own needs. Thierdly, the right to express opinion in words, music, films let society rich a pick of culture, have important and grand base to modernize social in the future. Moreover, freedom of arts guarantee political right in the modern world, when culture is a part of politics. Last argument is that Phucho content of free artist may up our society. In conclusion I would like say that freedom to express idea is important part of the modern rights.
