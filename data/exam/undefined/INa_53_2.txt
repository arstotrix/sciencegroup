Task 2.
   Nowadays our society meet the problem of decreasing level of healh. Several scientists suppose that one way of solving this problem is to increase amount of sports facilities in the citizens. Meanwhile, others argue that it would not have necessary influence on the public health.
   On the one hand, we can say that providing with sports facilities and equipment will bring our society benefits in health issue. The reason is that people looking at this facilities from day to day will have indend to exercise and train themselves. Moreover, it is impossible without this convenience. For instance, people will be situated not far from his home.
   On the other hand, some people trying to argue that sport have a little impact on health. The biggest problem concerns with water or wind pollution. The necessity of solving this problems is very important nowadays, but if we want increase level of the health of population we should develop other measures, which can be reliable to protect people and take care about health. For example, few months ago we saw a federal programe in USA named “Obamacare”, provided by the president of the USA. This programe is a sample how our government can take care about health of the people.
   To summarize, we should mention that more and more sports facilities are increasing nowadays. Moreover, our government should understand that it is not enough for public health and other measures are also required.
