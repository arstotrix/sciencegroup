Nowadays we cannot imagine our life without air travelling. Thanks to the invention of planes people may get in any part of the world wherever they want. But it is obvious that any kind of travelling leads to pollution and environmental problems, that is why governments think about the introduction of laws that should reduce the amount of air travelling. In my essay I will contradict this point of view with some arguments.
To begin with, it is rather better to do in such a way that the fuel is used by planes will be much cleaner and will not pollute our atmosphere. I suppose that scientifical organizations must be opened in aim to decide this problem. What is more, planes fly on a very high height and its air does not consist of oxygen. By the time wastes are nearer to the ground, they will dissapear.
I can give an example from my parentsâ€™ experience. As today there are a lot of bucinessmen, people have always to travel to different parts of the world in a proper time. My father once upon a time had 3 meetings in a day in different parts of Europe. In this case it is impossible to travel without plane.
To sum up, I would like to say that the governments should not concentrate on reducing the most outstanding invention of the mankind. It will be more productive if they think about positive ways of decision the questions connected with the air pollution.
