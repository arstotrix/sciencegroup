It is common knowledge that ecological desires are widely discussed by scientists and governments. Air polution caused by planes is a part of the problem. Some people claim that it is necessary to decline the amount of air travel others believe that it is not a way to solve problem.
My opinion is on par with the second point of view. To start with, decreasing business opportunities of travelling involves the reduce of investions in science which can significantly influence on the creation of new air protecting technologies. In case that business provide science, diminish of it’s opportunities may has not positive effect.
Moreover, people has a constitutional right to move wherever they want. Government of any country is not able to short it. Not only planes but also any other types of transport can contaminate the planet in some way. Ships polute water, cars and trains effect on air and land. It is impossible to reduce all these ways of travelling.
Furthermore, to my mind, the solution is in looking for new technologies, sources of energy and explorations. The best way to safe environment is to create machines that will not pollute it at all.
To sum up, not laws but peoples’ minds can help our planet to survive. Air polution can be solved by new ideas, not by limiting of air travels.
