Task 1.
   The chart provides some information about the people of Yemen and Ital who are devided to three parts according to their ages. It is composed of situation in 2000 and certain predictions for 2050.
   As it is mentioned in the chart, the percentage of young people (0-14) in Yemen is much higher than in Italy. In 2000 Yemen has 50,1 % against the Italian 14,3 %. It is one of the most important fact about the whole population of Yemen.
   A closer look at the data reveals that graph predicts the fall of Yemen young populationâ€™s to 37% by 2050. It means that Yemen will have more people who are aged from 15 to 59, and this percentage reaches 57,3 %.
   Nevertheless, we have to pay attention to the older people, Italy has a significant rise of this feature up to 42,3 % by 2050. Now it is time for government to think how to prevent this situation.
   In conclusion, I would like to say that Italy and Yemen are too different countries and it is too difficult to compare them.
