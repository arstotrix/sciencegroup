   The pie charts highlight the information on the ages of the populations in Yemen and Italy in 2050. There is also an additional chart that provides in projections for 2050 in both countries.
   Overall, in both Italy and Yemen there is a high level of populations aged from 15 to 59 years. Moreover, the increase of aging population is expected in both countries, although in Yemen this change is less significant.
   A closer look at the charts reveals that there are more differences than similarities between the countries` trends. For example, in Italy the amount of aging (60+ years) population rised twofold, while in Yemen there is only 21 percent increase. On the opposite, population of children younger than 14 is predicted to have a great extention, compered to 2, 8% fall in Italy.
   As it is clear from the given charts the population in Italy and Yemen is unstable and will alter. In 2050 we will see an another situation but definately it is hard to say if the predictions are right.
