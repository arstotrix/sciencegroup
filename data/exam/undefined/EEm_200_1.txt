In the given chart we can see the quantity of children who don’t have access to attend classes in primary school. The information is devided by gender and regions from 2000 to 2012.
The chart below shows that the higher level of children without education was in Africa in 2000. The number of such boys and girls was nearly the same and and was 43.7 millions. 12 years have passed and the number reduced and became 32.7. Africa showed the same level in 2012 as South Asia in 2000. But looking at the whole chart it is possible to notice that the lowest number of childer without access to primary school by the year 2012 is in South Asia, althouh in the privious years it’s level  (32.2) in general was higher than in the rest of the world (23.3).
In conclusion I would like to say that comparing with such countries as South Asia and Africa, the rest of the world showed better results. And I would like to add that in general girls have less opportunities for education than boys.
