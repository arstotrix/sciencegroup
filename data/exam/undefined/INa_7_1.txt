Writing task 1.
The charts show data about the ages of people living in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and give some changes are expected to happen in 2050.
   To begin, the majority of population probably will change in Yemen in the future and could be the same category of 15-59 year old in Italy.
  However, there are no similar percentages in data. The chart about Yemen illustrates the possible growth of the number of 15-59 year olds. In contrast, the chart about Italy shows the possible decline of the number of 15-59 year old people.
   Overall, the percentage of elderly people (60+years) in Italy in 2000 was really less, then in Yemen. However, the number of them in the future will probably be just less then now in both countries.
   In these countries, according to projections, which are done, we can see different data and different trends in the future concerning the population.
