There is an opinion, that art people should have no obstakles in expressing their ideas - to create any piece of art, any perfomance, any poem as they want it to look like. But often the process of creating something can't go without government permission to show it to audience after. It is a huge important question - to what extent government can be involved in art? First of all, we should imagine, what's happening without any government control. Any art is something - just a beauty itself, just appearance, a reflection of human's soul or maybe a claim. That is why government's policy should be ready to regulate it - in case of sexual content with not adults, extremism or something else. For example, there are age policy to see any art in Russia - that is right at all, but the point is to value the content properly. There can be a strickt law about art, but just reasonable and clear. Another thing is that too much control is also not a good idea for art. With the not reasonable law we get propaganda, when art becomes a huge powerful weapon in government's arms. In this case there can be lots of wrong decisions that can cause the humiliating of artists rights. That is why "Pussy Riot" band is not just art, but serious breaking of a law in case of government church propaganda. But talking about propaganda, there are lot of artists who are "in the shadow", who just go against it. Their pieces of art are always forbidden, but after all they become masterpieces. For example, the "Gulag" or Pasternak's poems. To sum up, government just should control and regulate the basics, the foundation of art - not the process of makinf it, but the process of proper showing. This point should be regulated. But there are no more aspects, no cases where else should be government. Great artist always knows how to express their opinion, and they will find their own audience despite the fact of government restrictions after all.
