Nowaday modern society face an issue of teenagers behavior in schools. Some people strongly believe, that teachers should influence teenagers and deal with their up bringing. Others will argue with them and say, that parents should make ruls for the children, and teachers at schools should avoid conflicts with teenagers. In my essay I am going to point out main points of view on this issue.

	Firstly, students at schools are really depend on their friends, so only school teachers can communicate with such a big group of people. It is not a task for one child’s family. Secondly, it is much more easier for school community to prevent some problems with students behavior, because teenagers very often do not speak to their parents.

	However, there is another opinion. There is a common believe that students at school want to develop themselves in the different ways, and teachers should not mention different problems with behavior, because it’s only family work. As far as I can judge, there are some prons and cons in these points of view. To cope with behavior problems parents and teachers should work together, there should be some kind of labour division. Teachers at schools must be interested in children development. They shouldn’t ignore important behavior problems, but first of all, parents must work end bring up their children.

	To sum up I would like to say, that truth are always somewhere in the middle. There should be balance between behavior ways.
