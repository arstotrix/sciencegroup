   Public health is one of the most important problem in our world. Some people believe that the best way to improve our health is increasing the number of sports facilities, but others people has another opinion. They sure that it gives little effect, and if people want good result they must find other measures. We can see that problem in different ways.
   On the one hand, it’s not a secret, that sport plays an important role in our life. It’s not only developing our body, but also give to our brain opportunities to walk faster. The British scicologists do a research and understand that the best way to improve our mood is do sports. That’s why if people want to be not only healthy, but also happy, they need to increas the number of sports.
   On the other hand, sometimes is not enough. The world know many disiases such as cancer in which sports don’t give the opportunity to be healthy. In this situation will be only little effect and scientist and another people have to do other measures.
   The another reason to develop sports facilities is Olympic games and sport competition. In February and March 2014 we can see how many people become healthy due to sport facilities. Many disabled people due to sport want to live and develop their opportunities. Sports give them hope and strong. Many people all around the world watch their results and also want to strong and healthy. That’s why government have to increas the number of sports facilities.
   In conclusion, I want to say that sports must be have the important role in our life. Sometimes it’s really not enough, but look at disabled people, they have hope and sports give them it. That’s why I strongly believe that in our life the best way to improve public health is by developing sports facilities.
