Nowadays air travel has become one of the most popular and widespread ways to trip abroad and within country. However, many people consider this tendency to be harmful for our air pollution and be the cause of global warming and other ecological problems. In their opinion it is high time to introduce laws for restricting the amount of air travelling. But I cannot agree with this point of view and believe such policy is not the right way to solve ecological issues.
Firstly, hardly will globalization continue if airplanes will be reduced. The ability to reach other country in a quick period of time is the key to successful business dealing. In addition, to travel means to broaden our horizons. But if this type of transport is reduced, people will not be able to develop and get new information which will lead to the fall of the whole cultural level of the population. Although, some people propose reading books and watching about trips as an alternative to travelling, I am sure that nothing can substitute getting impressions by visiting other countries.
On the other hand, airplanes are very harmful for our ecology, indeed. Many aircompanies use inexpensive materials to reduce their costs which leads to global warming. Moreover, most of the trips by plane are unnecessary and can be easily substituted by cars and trains. These arguments should be taken into account, but, we should not remember that the main cause of all ecological issues is the irresponsibility of humans.
To sum up, I believe that the reducing of air travels is not the best variant for social and political policy. Hardly will this measure change or solve all issues connected with air pollution or global warming. However, it will lead to the absence of globalization and cultural development.
