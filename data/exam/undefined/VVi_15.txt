There are a lot of people who are very talented and have already been masters in thier field. Especially, these days the areas which have very big audience, such as, picture, music, film and etc. are developing sicnificantly. However, does not mean that they can express their ideas freely. Of course, there should be improsed amits of goverment in their activities. Without restrictions there may be some problem, since some art works contain the ideals which are not suitable for children and goverment’s (…).
For many years art has been playing the main role in our social life. Creative persons of art are respected in many countries, since they can attract people with their talent and results of their artistic works. However, most of the claim that there should not be restriction by government in their work, for they cannot show their particular ideas in this way. Moreover, as a result, of this some talented people can leave the country which has strong restriction and work. Where there will be danger of troubling many people if their activities are unlimited. As we look at the history even people with great gifts like Leonardo Da Vinci were not allowed to express anything  ideas they wish. Also, in most areas artists were not let draw pictures of a person, since it was prohibited by religion. At those times, religion helped a country to control people, so the rules of religion had to be obeyed. Even today, majority of films and songs must be checked by special … of government, since there are some songs which have very unpleasant words. It is the most efficient way to spread bad ideas in films, so must of them influence on behaviour of children.
To sum up, I think the ideas of  the artists must be limited by ears. It is easy to get attention of people with these ideas, since they are very popular today.
