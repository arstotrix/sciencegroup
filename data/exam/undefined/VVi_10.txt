Some people think that creative artists should express their ideas how they want and there should express their ideas how they want and there should be no government influence on what they do.
On the one hand creative artists should have all the freedom to express their ideas. One of the reason is that they are creative people who “build” their own ideas in the way they want and if there are some rules for influence it will destroy the meaning of the world “creative”. They will become just artist who express not their own ideas, but only the idies they are allowed to express. What’s more the most famous creations in music, pictures, sculpture were made by creators themselves with no idea to sell it, or become popular, with no government restrictions.
On the other hand the influence on creative artists was every time  and everywhere, for example in musics  firsly there was classical music, than Rock music and soon, so fashion had influenced on the artists ideas all the time ad it was not a bad influence. Also the main idea of all artists is to create something which people likes, because they want there work to be market in a good way. What’s more sometimes the government restriction are too strong. However in the most number of countries they are no restrictions or they don’t have any influence on art.
In conclusion I want to say that nowadays there are too many types of art and creative artists have the very big range of things they can do. However there are some governments restrictions but they only want peoples’ standarts be following.
