Creative people need to have an opportunity to demonstrate their thoughts and their talent. It is inevitable thing for them, they need it to develop. But they should be carefull with te impression they could make on other peopleâ€™s minds. Government should also control them to prevent detrimental effect of some art works.
To take a closer look, we could examine the situation when a writor makes a book about the adventures of proffesional thief, who was involved in some extraodinary criminal event. The story could be very involving and impressive, and a reader, espesially a young one, could deside that being thief is really interesting. So government should prevent such book to be placed in children libraries and in free access on the Internet. 
Not only book readers, but TV audience is also highly vulnurable to hard impression of some touching or, in other case, horrible movies. Such art works should not be broadcasting on the prime-time. Moreover, the audience need to be carefully informed about the specific of the movie and about age limits, if there are ones.
Then, the bright coloured pictures or cartoones could hurt people with some deseases. Such people should forbidden to contact with art works which are dangerous for them.
So, government is in charge of the effect that some creative people could make. But there shouuld not be restrictions for them, only warnings and safety measures.
