It is true to say that nowadays student’s discipline is very bad and it is a serious problem for school in many countries, while at the same time this situations are take place more often. I personally believe, that parents and teachers should take measures.

This situation could caused by a number of reasons, first of all, it is happening because in modern life students have more freedom, they have the right to choose what they have to do, they often personally make desisions about their privat life and their study, consequently, because they are not old enough to do it, they often make mistakes and their behaviour become not very good.

Another important key point follow to the situation it their family. Nowadays, business plans are more important issue for parent then their childrens, generally speaking they have no time for their childrens to tell what they should do, not with standing it should be the main purpose for them.

I personally believe, that parent and school teachers should take measures, for instance, organise some special meetings in school to demonstrate that their behaviour have some severe problems, thereupon they are able to see the standarts of students behaviour, hence it will correct the school discipline.

To sum up, as far as I am concerned, the problem with students  behaviour is too seriour to ignore, some measures have to be taken soon. It is a growing concern for parents and teachers, they should take some measures to solve this problem, since it results problems with children’s discipline.
