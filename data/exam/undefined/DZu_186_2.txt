Some people say that Air travel has been to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. I agree with them. Global warming is one of the biggest problem today. In big cities the problem of air pollution is too very actually. Air pollution has bad effect for our health, breath. The caused of air pollution are cars, air travels. All people understand it but we can’t do nothing. Air travel is unimportant part of our life. It’s one of the most fast and cheap transport, governments shouldn’t introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel. In my opinion we have to search the other solution of this problem. Maybe we can do air travel more healthy for our planet. There are a lot of organizations like Greenpeace which fight with that problems. People have to be more activity and support that organizations. I thing government have to spend more money from bugget for some ideas how to save our planet.  I have no ideas. On the one hand people really need air travels, cars and so on, which save our time, but on the other hand it has bad effect for our planet, for our healt and breath. We have to search the solution of that problem or it will slowly killed us. Our children must leave in safy world.
