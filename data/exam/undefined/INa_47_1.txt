Task 1.
   Four charts contain data about various ages of Yemen and Italy population in 2000 and the predictions about population of both countries in 2050.
   According to the first chart about Yemen, the majourity of population was 0-14 years old and about half of the Yemen citizens were 15-59 years. While only 3,6 % of population were the oldest people. According the predictions, in 2050 there will be a significant changes in Yemen. For example, there should be growth of 15-59 years from 46,3 % to 57,3 %, and the decline of 0-14 years 37 %.
   The first chart about Italy illustrates that more than half of citizens were 15-59 years. However, the second largest group was people over 60 years. According the second chart, it must be a steady increase of 60+ years category from 24 to 42 % by 2050. People of average year will continue to be the largest group, but with only 46,2 % of population istead of 61,6 % in 2000.
   To sum up, by 2100 middle-aged people will have been dominated both in Yemen and Italy. However, Yemen has more young generation than Italy, which has plenty of citizens aged over 60+ years. This tendency will continue in future.
