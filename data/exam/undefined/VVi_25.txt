Nowadays exists too many kinds of art, however, most of them has some limits of style. Creative and talent artists are limited in their creations by government restrictions. Then any ideas and imaging crashed at their birth and artist starts to make the same things in only one style and it is not ever good.
Real artist can not to be limited by anything. He creates and then that is his rules in his world of minds. Any kind of art is the flight of fantasy and ideas can not be stopped by limits of material world. That called “be a real artist”, when you continue to create instead rules of public and critics.
For example I can tell you about the word’s known dee-jay called “Sknillex”. When he started his way, his tracks was unrepeatable with the strongest and most beautifull sonnds. However, world’s communities calls that simple and strange music. After that he made some songs in normal limits of exist’s style and reached 3 Grammys.
