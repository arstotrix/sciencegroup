   Nowadays there are a lot of discussions between people about public health. There are two hands of vision. One people think that the most important action to improve public health is to increase the number of sports facilities. In contrast, others think that it will provide not so essential effect on public health and itâ€™s necessary to use other measures. To my mind increasing the number of sport facilities is not enouth, would be the best effect if people use the complex of facilities.
   Firstly, we should say that public health is an important aim not only for citizens but for governments too. Public health can`t increase without sports facilities. Sometimes people don`t want to be healthy but it is, clearly, there problem. On the other hand there are a lot of people who needs in sports facilities. Government should control building of new sportsgrounds, swimming pools, health centres. When people have sports facilities they have a possibility to realize there wishes.
   Secondly, we have a good example of increasing public health in whole country. I mean China, where it is normal and, moreover, necessary for Chineese to do morning exercise every morning. There are also a lot of sports facilities there and we should be equal with them in these issues.
   Another point of view is that it would have little effect on public health. There are some other measures to improve public health. They are significant too. WE have to use sports facilities but in the same time we have to use sports facilities but in the same time we have to take a contrast shower, eat healthy food, don`t nerve in everyday life, breath clear air.
   In my opinion, only if we use all the parts we will be healthy. The government should give us sports facilities, healthy food in shops. And we should protect ourself and take care about ourself.
