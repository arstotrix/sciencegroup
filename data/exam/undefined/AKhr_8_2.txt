In our time more and more people like doing something that express their own ideas and feelings - it calls "art". But there is always a question, may people do it in the way they want or should there be some limitations? In my opinion, the government have to make some restrictions on artists acts. Firstly, the freedom of speech and art can lead to political chaos and riots. In my experience there was a band "Pussy riot", which made about two years ago a show in a church, so untill now there are people, who support them, and people, who are really upset because of this. This show was made to let russian people know that there is a big opposition of president Putin but also after this situation in Russia there was a big support of president, too. Secondly, sometimes artists express their ideas and feelings in way, which is not allowed not only by the government but by the peoples will. There is another one example from my knowledge: man, who wanted to tell everybody about his political position, made himself unmoved on the Red Square and he was without any clothes. Such situation can express peoples ideas, but they also can hurt minds and feelings of other people. By the way, there is an another point of view. Artists can't be limited by any laws because art can't be made with fail feelings of a person. If person thinks in some way and wants to share other people his or her thoughts or ideas, it will not be real and understandable to others, if this person will make it not in that way, in which he or she wants. To summarize, I will say, that my opinion doesn't change because feelings of other people are more important than art, how I think. But there will be discussions about it and nowadays there is no one right answer.
