It is obvious that travelling by air pollutes the Earth atmosphere. Some people claim that decreasing the number of flights which are not necessary by laws can help to save our planet. I partially agree with this opinion.
Introducing special laws might be a good idea for reducing the amount of air travellers as it would be controlled by countryâ€™s government and would be obeyed by most people. Owners of air travel companies, pilots, businessman would think twice before making an unnecessary flight if otherwise their freedom would be in danger. Moreover, nowadays a lot of famous people have got their own planes and personal pilots to travel anywhere they want. I fully agree with the idea that such flights are not always urgent and most of time business and leisure flights can be made by train, bus or water.
On the other hand, travelling by means of air is the most convenient way to move around, especially for long distances, and I believe taking this opportunity from people, travelling in unurgent situations, is unfair as other ways of tackling this problem exist. Reducing the number of of flight made for business and leisure is a too strict method in my opinion. Why a businessman has to travel for weeks if he can fly for hours from Europe to America? Aircraft is one of the most genius things made by humanity and we shall use it for 100%. To solve the problem of air pollution we could introduce the laws that make sure all planes use eco-energy sources that do not contribute to global warming. Instead of reducing the number of of flights, making all of them eco-friendly would dramatically change the situation.
All in all, I cannot fully agree with the idea that governments should introduce laws to decrease the number of flights as there are other less strict ways to flight with the global warming problem.
