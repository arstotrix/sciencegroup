The bar chart given demonstrates the educational degree of Australian people in 1999, depending on their gender. There is a tendency that all the levels of qualification differ dramatically in the gender of people they are represented by. Whether it is men or women who prevail in a particular educational level, with only one exception in Bachelor's degree can one see the difference by sex. Another worthwhile feature of the chart is that men tend to get skilled vocational diplomas a lot more frequently than women do, while the latter seem to treat undergraduate's diplomas as more important or convinient. The figures for them are 90% and 75% correspondently. As seen from the chart, education is not a thing which - as statisticians say - between genders. There will always be things that are worth our attention.
