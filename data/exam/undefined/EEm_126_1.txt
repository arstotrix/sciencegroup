The bar chart shows several fluctuations in the number of young people that can not go to primary school through the period from 2000 to 2012 year by gender and region.
It is clearly seen from the first sight that the amount of children in Africa in 2000 year reached its peak on the point of around 43 millions. It is the highest rate in the world. We can that in South Asia in 2012 year 10 millions of youngsters did not have access to the education. However, it is the lowest number during the given period in the world.
It is the fact that in a two year period more and more children in the world starting going to the primary school and getting an education up to 2012 year. In addition to it, the percentage of boys and girls stays nearly the same during the period.
In conclusion, I would say again that we can see the tendency of declining numbers of young people without access to primary education by region and gender in the whole world.
