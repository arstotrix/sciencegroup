The chart illustrates the proportions of both boys and girls from Africa, South Asia and other countries who don’t have access to primary school education in 2000 and 2012. Overall, it can be easily seen that the amount of children of both genders without the possibility to get education declined in all regarded countries in 2012 compared to 2000.
The most striking feature of the chart is the drop of the amount of girls from 21.6 millions to 4.8 millions in South Asia. It is necessary to notice that in Africa and other countries the number of girls without access to primary education declined as well, but not so crucially compared to South Asia. Moreover, the change in the proportions of boys in South Asia is great as well. The number of boys who couldn’t get education in 2000 was twice as much as this figure in 2012. In Africa and the rest of world the situation has become better, also. The number decreased from 23.7 to 18.2 and from 12.8 to 7.6 respectively.
