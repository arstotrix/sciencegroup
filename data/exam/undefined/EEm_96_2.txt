There are many ways to travel today, starting with strolling and finishing with private jets. Private jets and planes in general are the fastest and probably the safest way to travel on long distances. Although, is this more important than nature and planet itself?
There is an opinion, that government has to reduce laws, that will limit the amount of air travel for business and leisure. I completely disagree with this opinion. First of all, it is violation of human rights. Some trips are practically impossible without planes. For example - “Moscow - Salt-lake-city” flight. It will take weeks to reach it without plane. Wil there be less emited substances? I doubt it.
Secondly, there is a problem with choosing people who will be able to travel by plane. There is literally no way to introduce these laws without harm to the tourists. Also, this decision should be accepted by most of the countries for it to become effective. And, if we are speaking about harm, there are many countries, that have main profits from tourism. Harm to those countries will be undeniable.
Althoug, there is a way to make this happen, and it is a long way. There should be developed other transport systems so speed of travelling will be compensated by comfortable seats, cheap prices on trains and other non-fliable transports.
In the end I’d like to admit that these laws make sense, but their introducing should not be abrupt but must be after years of preparations and introducing othe transport laws.
