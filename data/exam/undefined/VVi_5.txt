The chart gives information about post-school qualifications in Australia in 1999. We can see proportion of men and women who got some degree.
It can be seen that there’s always difference between percent men and women with certain degree. The most significant feature is that 90 percent of people with skilled vocational diploma are male. The difference between other proportions is less significant. For example number of males with bachelor’s diploma is only several percent less than number of females with one.
It also can be mentioned that there is about 70 percent females with undergraduate diploma while just a little bit less than 70 percent of people with postgraduate diploma are men. There is a 30 percent difference between proportion of men and proportion of women with master’s degree. 
As we can see, each gender is dominant at some qualification. Sometimes difference is huge and sometimes it’s quite small.
