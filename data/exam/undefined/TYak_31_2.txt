It’s naturally, that sometimes schools have some problems with student behavior. I’m not totally agree with this point of view, because different people have different views about good behavior. But this point of view exists, that’s why I have to tell about it.

	The causes are totally different. The first one is the family and friends, whith whom student has contacts every day I think, that today parenst don’t pay much attention on the education, but I suppose, that this things are bouth important.

	The second reason is our sosciety. Now it axcepts all tipes of behavior if you are sucxessful and useful. It doesn’t metter for modern people what kind of man is in front of them.

	I think, that behaviours aren’t the question, which school can and should in fluence. It is the problem of parents and school should only give the good aducation.

	But sometimes bad behaviours influence the aducation of other students. We can see children, who didn’t used to talk polietly with their teachers and with other sudents. That is why it can leade to the conflecte among students and also between the groupp and the theacher. In this situation the teacher should do anything. The students must solve the problem themselves, and the director must speak with the parents.

	For resolution of the problem we can do more films for students, which shous the good behaviours. I suppose, that art and family is the only ways to solve this problem. To evoid spending of time with bad friends children must go in for sports, visite different clubs of interests. At this situation they have no time to be a part of bad gang and to argue with friends and teachers.

	To sum up, I can say, that problems with student behaviour isn’t a schools problem, parents and friends only can influence it. Culture, arts and sport are the best solutions of this problem.
