The bar chart illustrates levels of past-school qualifications in Australia and the percentage of men and women who held them in 1999.
At first look we can see the largest bar’s scale in this chart, called “Skilled vocational diploma” where males takes the level in almost 90 percent. In contrast, females’s scale in this part is nearly 10 percent and that is smallest scale in all the graph.
However, in part called “Undergraduate diploma” females takes their highest percent around 70%. Males’s level is lesser in two times. Bachelor’s degree reached by men and women has approximately same percentage, where females leads with 55 percent. 
The picture of level of “Postgraduate diploma” is the opposite for second scales. The last chart is percentage of Master’s degree and it is leaded by males with difference in 20 percent. 
In conclusion, I can tell that bar chart shows that men’s and women’s percentages of post-school qualification is very different, but all of them tries to reach Master’s degree and their interests in this are same.
