Nowadays we can clearly see that travelling by planes causes a lot of harm that nature gets. Due to this fact states and organizations should create some in order to reduce amount of business and leisure flights.
It is clear that only goverment can cope with this problem as nature could not protect itself. Though, the most powerful and the wealthiest countries can make an impact on air companies. One of the solutions that can reduce air pollution is introducing limits of flights. This would make flights more expensive and companies would make only the best workers to move to another location, while most would work in their own countries in order to reduce costs. This will also make companies to search future workers in the countries where they operate.
The goverments can also make companies to hire only native workers or hire foreign staff only after they can prove that there is not anybody in the country who can do the same job. Some states such as the USA and Canada have already introduces this law. It leads to reducing of leisure immigration and flights which can stop global warming or at least to lower air pollution.
Due to this, companies won’t hire lot of foreign workers in spite of the laws. If all countries did this, we would have less pollution and amount of flights all over the world. It could even cause extinction of business and leisure travelling across the world.
All things mentioned and considered, it seems to me that all the states must introduce some new laws those would help the nature as we must protect it and the Earth as well for future generations. It can be too late if we won’t do it as number of flights all over the world is travelling.
