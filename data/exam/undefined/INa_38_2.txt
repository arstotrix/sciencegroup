Writing task 2.
   “Health is above wealth” wise people say. But it’s really difficult to lead healthy way of life in 21th. One of the most important factors is sport. But in the same time, it is one of the big problem to force people to do sport.
   It’s not surprising that first of all, necessary facilities should be created in the city. For example, palaces of sports, fitness clubs, sports grounds and ect. But it’s not absolutely effective. People should understand that doing sport is important for them and their children.
   Other important part is promotion of sport. For example it can be from the TV show, school subjects like physical culture. But first of all government should promote the helthy way of life in the country. The Olympic games make sport popular among people. After watching the competitions raises the sport spirit in everybody. So, it’s very important to hold such as sport competition in country.
   In conclusion, I want to say that I think sport can not only make healthy nation but also happy. Sport make people happy. You can spent time with you friends playing football. And it make you closer. As for me, I like doing sport. I prefer going to the fitness club. It help me to relax after long and hard day.
