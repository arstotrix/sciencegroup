Task 1.
  The charts show information about ages of the people of Yemen and Italy from 2000 to 2050.
   The population of Yemen was 50,1 % in the ages from 0 to 14 years in 2000. At the same time, population from 0 to 14 years was approximately 14 percent in Italy. However, 61,6 percent people were in the ages from 15 to 59 years 2000.
   The population from 15-59 years will be 57,3 percent in Yemen at 2050. However, in Italy it will be 46,7 %.
   On the one hand, the most a little percent of people from 60+ years will be in Yemen at 2050. I consider that it will be very well and useful for Yemenâ€™s economic in future. On the other hand, it will 42,3 percent in Italy at 2050.
   In conclusion, we can see that the number of population will increase about 11% between of people in the ages from 15 to 59 in Yemen, but this percent will decrease in Italy. I hope, that the all to be okay in this countries.
