In this fast-moving world it is hard to imagine society living without air travel. This means of transport has become a necessity for businessmen, students and all other kinds of people. However, planes are well-known to pollute the air a lot. A s far as I am concerned, the humanity should take care of the environment. So the authorities ought to think about introducing some restrictions in the sphere of air travel.
In the first place, such measures done by governments could prevent the ozone layer from further destruction. For example, private flights may be punished by introducing high taxes on them. This can result in choosing alternative way to travel and, what is more, will definitely help the environment, so the situation may not get even worse.
Furthermore, the number of flights in general also has to be decreased. It has become quite common to fly in almost empty airplanes which is really inadequate. If the quantity of such flights fell, the amount of poisoning gases and fumes would be reduced as well.
However, there are those who claim that decreasing the number of flights will lead to unability of the majority to travel the world. Air travel has become rather cheap with introducing flights without dinners and etc.
Nevertheless, the modern transport system offers variable opportunities to reach any destination person needs. The cost may also be different. This means that almost everybody can find something suitable and convenient for he or she.
To conclude, I should say that I totally for reducing the number of planes and flights in order to protect the environment, because even this small step may lead to better living conditions in the future.
