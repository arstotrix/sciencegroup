Writing task 2.
   Healthproblem has recently become one of the most crucial issues of humanity. Global pollution, bad living facilities, lack of money and other modern factors result in the low level of public health. IT’s obvious that some urgent measures should be taken up and in this matter some people claim that providing sport facilities will change the situation. However, I agree with another point of view which stands for improving common healthcare facilities.
   Firstly, the quality of provided medical services should be taken into account. That includes high-qualified healthcare staff, modern technologies and effective methods of cure and diagnostics. German, Israel clinics can be a good example in the case as they are famous all over the world.
   Secondly, the price of provided services should also be considered. The quality is useless when it is absolutely unavailable to a person with the average salary. In this matter special medical credits and benefits should be provided especially for children and elderly people.
   As to the first point of view, it can be effective in some cases. To my mind providing sports facilities will be insufficient without proper motivation and even advertisement among population. To support this point of view an example of Moscow yards, which have been recently equipped with simple sports trainers be used. The idea of city’s government hasn’t been met with much enthusiasm and as a result the trainers are used quite seldom.
   To summurize, the problem of public health can be considered as a challenging one. To my mind, a complex a measures should be taken up to solve it.
