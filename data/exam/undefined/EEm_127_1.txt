The bar chart illustrates the differences between the number of children (by gender) who did not have an opportunity to get a primary school education from 2000 to 2012 in Africa, South Asia and rest of the world.
Overall, the most significant change was in South Asia, while in Africa and the rest of the world the percentage of children without access to education reduced slightly.
As it can be seen from the chart, there is no great difference in the amount of children by gender (only in 2000 in South Asia more than twice as more girls as boys did not have an access to education). The biggest amount of children without was in Africa in all years. By 2012 it decreased only by 11% and the similar situation was in the rest of the world when the percentage decreased by 8%. In South Asia a situation was much better when the amount of children without education reduced in 22.8% (from 32.7 in 2000 to 9.9 in 2012). It should be noticed that in 2000 in Africa almost a half of children did not have an opportunity to get an education and in 2012 this amount was on the level of one third from all children.
