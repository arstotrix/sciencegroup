The graph and the table chart provide data on the number of people coming to the UK and leaving it between 1979 and 1999, as well as on the top 5 visited by the Britons countries in 1999.

Overall trands of the number of those who visit the UK and other countries are upward, having this as a similar feature.

A more detailed look on the graph help to reveal some striking points. Firstly, in the 1979 there were 10 million people visiting the UK and about 12 million British people travelling to other places – the number of members of both groups is almost the same.

But after a 20-year period both figures increased, reaching the points of 25 million and 53 million people respectively. 

In spite of the fact that both lines have gone up, it’s worth mentioning that the increase of the number of those who prefer to go abroad the UK has almost trippled, showing much bigger changes.

As for the top 5 visited by the British countries in 1999 it is France and Spain to be the leaders: 12 and 10 mln visitors respectively.

The least visited  were Turkey, Greece and the USA, greeting 2 ,3 and 4 mln people in the given order. 

Thus, the trands of those coming and leaving the UK are pretty similar: about 10 mln people in 1979 (at the starting point) and 30 to 50 (aproximately) mln people in 1999 respectively. The upward trand (despite the difference in numbers) is obvious. Besides, 20% of British travellers (10 mln out of 50) prefered France as an interesting tourist landmark and only 4% (2 mln out of 50) went to Turkey.
