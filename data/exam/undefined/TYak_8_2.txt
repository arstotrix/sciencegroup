For teachers monitoring the situation the only way out is to find ant the reasons of bad behaviour. That’s why it’s very important to try to reveal them. So what are they?

	First thing that should be mentioned is a student’s affitude to this state institution – school. They offen don’t take info consideration its importance and considerable influence on their future life.

	The features of social communication also can’t be omitted. Social groups formed by unsuccessful students can have an impact on offers leading to non-formal type of behaviour and low marks. Trying not to be involved in sush groups inmany cases causes to misudez-standingand different conflicts between all the participants.

	No matter what the causes of students bad behavior are, we should remember that the most difficult task is to present such kinds of actions and if it’s not succud to stop them. One of these solutions for solning the problems can be a popularization of healthy life style and conventional rules of behavior.
