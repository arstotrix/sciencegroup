Airplanes have made travelling much easiar. Every person having some amount of money can get almost everywhere to Earth. Such a great opportunity of modern world has own drawbacks, one of which is cotribution to air pollution and global warming. That is why some say that concrete measures should be taken to tackle this problem. They mention about introducing laws by government to reduce the number of air travel for business and entertainment. I can not agree on that most of air travel is unnecessary.
Firstly, air traveling is part of the world economic. It is business and it’s really high profitablle. Some countries make almost all of their GDP on tourism which is based on air travelling, that’s why it is irrational to get touristic countries into poverty  taking serious measures.
From the other side, we can’t close our eyes on such a tough questions like air pollution and global warming. The amount of poisonous gases in the atmosphere produced by airplanes should be reduced but with no decreasing the number of flights. Using the motivation not from but to, government should make better conditions to air companies that use more eco-friendly technologies, decreasing taxes and giving some grants.
In the conclusion, air travelling is undoubtedly one of the world’s joys, the step forward, and government should not reduce the amount of this good to make atmosphere more clear from the pollution. To solve the problem of global warming and air pollution government should decrease taxes and give some grants for eco air companies.
