Nowadays a lot of people argues, how to improve peopleâ€™s health. Some of them want to make more sport facilities. But will it bring to the headed effect?
   On the one hand, lots of people take care of their health. They usually do sport, for example, going to the youga classes, playing football or basketball or doing some morning exercises. Some of them keep healthy diet and eat only healthy food. When person do some sport, he looks and feel himself better. People should do sport not from time to time, but regularly and it must become a part of their life.
   On the other hand, the increasing just a number of sport facilities can not lead to needed results. Because some people do not like sport activities or it can help them to be healthy. If the people really want to improve public health, they will need a complex measures which will change every part of social life. For example, people can organize new fasion direction when fast food will be unpopular and because of it people will not eat junk food. So, if someone want to get people healthier, he/she must change the ordinary people behavior.
   In my opinion, the best way to improve the people health is creating a complex of measures which would have an effect on people. This measures will include sport facilities, healthy food and decrease of air pollution. In addition, I think that just increasing the number of sort facilities can help improve public health only in short run. But in a long run it will not lead to expected result.
