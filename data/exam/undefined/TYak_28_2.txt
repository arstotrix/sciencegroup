Nowadays bad students’ behaviour in schools issue is a kind of common problem around the world. This problem occurred practically in every school and class.

If we speak about causes of such behaviour, I believe that mostly it is because of students want to catch attention of their surroundings, of their friends and classmates. Something this kind of showing-off is the only way for students to look like independent and mature people. To my, sometimes this problem occurs not just because of sudents’ willing, but because of some problems in student’s family or health. Also I am sure that bad behaviour can be caused by the fact that student do not want to be under someone’s control. I believe that sometimes students can not deal with some troubles and control, that is why thay start to behave in non-acceptable way.

From my point of view, this problem can be solved only individually. I mean that sometimes teachers or parents just need to explain that student should not behave this way for some reasons. It is very important not to make student behave the way everyone like, but to explain why it is important and worfy for him of her personally. Moreover, to my mind, it is necessiry to be polite and patient with student, to be a good example for them, because I am absolutely sure that rudeness can do nothing good for a student. Furthermore, if the problem is connected with students’ behaviour at lessons, I think that in some way it is teacher’s guilty. I suppose that bad  behaviour is a sign of need of some changes in teaching process.

All in all, I am convinced that problems with student behaviour can be sowed, even though sometimes it seemed to be hard and impossible. I am sure that this issue should be changed by adults: parents and teachers, who should be very patient, polite and accurate.
