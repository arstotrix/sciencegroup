The first chart illustrates how many UK people traveled abroad at the period from 1979 to 1999 year and how many overseas residents visited the UK. The second chart shows the countries where the biggest number of UK residents were.

Overall, the number of trips was growing dramatically all the period, in the 1979 year the millions people who travel from UK and those, who travel to was equal. Then visits abroad became much more. The less popular country visited by UK residents from the chart is Turkey, while France is the most popular.

As we can see, in 1999 year about 11 million people traveled to France, about 9 million to Spain and only 9 to Turkey. The number of people who visit UK was 11 million in 1979 and it dramatically increased to 52 million in 1999. By the time, visits to UK had stable growth, from 10 to 28 million.

To sum up, the both charts are connected, because they give information about travel abroad by U&K residents, the first one also shows number of people visited UK.
