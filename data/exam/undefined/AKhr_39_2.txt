It is a long-lasting contradiction between free individuals and the government based on a lack of consensus about limits of public interference into private life. One of the issues is an allowance for any creators to cast their belief and attitudes without censorship. There is no obvious solution for that. On the one hand, creative people should have an opportunity to bring into life new pieces of art or somehow develop their personality. Government's primal aim is to make its citizens happy, and freedom to express ideas is essential here. For example, if government would pursuit all the critics who are arguing about the ways of living, it would have inevitably fall into new Nazi genocide nightmare. At margins, at least. On the other hand, sometimes people excercise their beliefs in a way of abusing society. They rarely fulfil the cultural heritage but rather exploit social cleaveges. Indeed, a rock band "Pussy Riot" always tried to make a provocative performance by desecrating traditional values. The essence of their art is to decrease a level of moral restrictions without respect to those who never wished it. To my mind, any valid sort of state always require decent restrictions. There are may be no universal values but there are always some social conditions which can help to solue each puzzle of modern art performance. To sum up, it takes a great effect to allow people act freely without restricting each others freedom. There are no easy solutions and society should judge each piece of art as an actual political (and moral) request.
