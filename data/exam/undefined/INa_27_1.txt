Writing Task 1.
   The given charts provide information on the age groups of Yemen and Italy populations in 2005 and also forecast the likely projections for 2050.
   Overall, here is a tendency in both countries that older age groups will increase their popularities dramatically, while the percent of younger people will drop.
   In particular, in Yemen the amount of people in 60+ year group will be 10  percent more than in 2000. This and the fact that the percent 0-14 year age group will drastically fall show that the life level in Yemen will rise. On the other hand the situation in Italy will remain more stable than in Yemen. The changes in Italy are not so obvious, though the tendency is the same as in Yemen.
   To summarise, the main trend is that the life level will increase, people will live longer and all in all there will be an older society than it is now.
