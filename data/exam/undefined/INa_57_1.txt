Task 1.
   These pie charts illustrate the percentage different age groups representatives both in Yemen and Italy in 2000. They also give predictions for 2050.
   If we look at the charts, illustrating figures in 2000, it can be clearly seen, that just over half of Yemenâ€™s habitants were under 14 years old, which is significantly larger, than those in Italy (just over 14 percent). At the same time a number of 15-5 years totals in just under 62 pecent, which is approximately 15 percent bigger, than in Yemen over 60 years old representatives may be met more frequently in Italy man in Yemen (24,1 % and 3,6 % respectively).
   A more detailed look at the charts showing the predictions for 2050, reveals that significant changes in age structure of both countries will take place. There will be much more elderly population in Italy in comparison with 2000 (24,1 % and 42,3 % accordingly), while in Yemen this percentage is expected to increase only by just over two percent. In addition to it, the percentage of under 14 years old will be approximately three times as much in Yemen as in Italy.
   To sum up it can be connected, that age structure will change significantly, and both countries will face these changes in near future.
