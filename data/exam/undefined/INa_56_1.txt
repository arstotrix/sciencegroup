Task 1.
   The pie charts illustrate data about the proportion of population of different ages in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and 2050.
  After a detailed look on the first 2 charts that present information on Yemen population, it can be seen that the number of people aged 15-59 years is predicted to rise substantially. In addition, this group of people will reach its peak by being more than a half of the whole population. Nevertheless,  the quantity of small children and little teenagers aged 0-14 years, being the half of population in 2000, in the 2050 will fall dramatically. As for 60+ years age group, it will practically remain stable in its proportion.
   A close view on the proportion of population in Italy in 2000 and 2050 is given in the 2 second pie charts. The percentage of people aged 0-14 is predicted to reach the same level as it was in 2000 with a slight fall. However, there will be a substantial rise of quantity of people aged 60+ from 24,1 % to 42,3 %. In addition, the group of population 15-59 years will drop significantly.
   Overall, the proportion of population in Yemen and Italy are completely different and no similarities are noticed. However, to compare population in these two countries the difference can be marked out. People of elderly age (60+) in Italy are far more widespread that in Yemen. On the contrast, children aged 0-14 have much more great percentage in proportion of population in Yemen than in Italy.
