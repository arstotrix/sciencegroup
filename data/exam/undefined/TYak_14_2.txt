In many countries schools have severe problems with student behaviour.

In our time it is very actual problem, because parents more often begin forget about their children and pay them very few attention  ? that’s why student behaviour can be bad.

On the one hand this problem is really serious, because student behaviour can be awfull from some physical problems. For example their bad childhood or situation in their family. Very often parents don’t spend enough time with children and after that they get angry and their behaviour is awful. That’s why students also often to do unnormal things at school and teachers can’t find solving this problems.

On the other hand bad behaviour of students is normal. Because all children like to play, shout, laugh and to do silly thing. And if kids don’t do all this and look like seriously and depressionly it is not well. It also can say about some problems.

In conclusion, I want to say that students behaviour should be bad and well similary, because all children must have happy childhood and know what does it mean “happy” and “funny” kid. And it is necessary for parents to pay their kids more attention, tell them what is bad and what is normal, then children will have normal behaviour, happy childhood and schools will not have to research solving this problem because it will be apsent.
