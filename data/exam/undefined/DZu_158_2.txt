Nowadays the problem of global warming and air pollution is widely discussed. There are different views on how to fight with that problems.
From my point of view, governments of all countries in the world are responsible for such tragic situation which we have nowadays. Of course, every year new laws should be created to prevent not only the air pollution, but also water and soil pollution. To my mind, many people do not realise with what problems we are going to face with in the next fifty years, for example. Such big countries like United States, Russian Federation, China and others should control the process of polluting the air the planes. I am absolutely sure that people do not need travel as much as they travel nowadays. But it they want to they still have a chance sometimes to choose other ways to travel (by train, by bus, etc.). But most of all should be banned frequent flights for people who travel for business. I understand people who choose the plane when they want to go on a journey. It is fast and they really enjoy their free-time. But if you travel for business you do not need such priveleges. In that case the main target of the person is to work, but not to relaxe. I have a friend who always travel by plane because he has a cancer, so it will be more difficult for him to travel by plane. For such people there should always be an opportunity to travel by plane.
In conclusion, I would like to say that high level of air travelling causes air crashes. Even if we control the safety, we will not be able to predict such occassions. But preventing the air pollution is the main goal of the whole world.
