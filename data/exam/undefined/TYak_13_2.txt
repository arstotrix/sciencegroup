	Lately there has been a significant debate over the terms of regulating the student’s behavior in schools and universities. Some people think that students are mature enough to be responsible without any restrictions while others insist on the number of rules to deal with them. So why do the students even start to behave in an inappropriate why and is thre any solution for this problem?

	The years in university is the new level of freedom for two basic reasons. Firstly, many young people more out of their parent’s houses and start living on their own. Secondly, the professors in academics do not have mach common with school teachers as their purpose is already not to nurture young son is but to let them focus on the subject. The consequence is that the sense of any control seems to be gone for the majority of students and they start misbehaving.

	 Another factor is perhaps that school-leavers are not adapted enough ti the world of grown-ups where relations are build on a different basis than they were before. Moreover, sometimes their mind stays childish that’s why some clear regulations can still help. For example it is proved that wearing uniform helps in organization of any community and also in building the common sense among its members. Such moments as usage of mobile phones also has to be regulated in case of possible inconvenience both for students and professors.

	To sum up, the best solution to the problem of student behavior is to teach them how to communicate basing of mutual respect and dignity. However, some simple rules may significantly help to improve this situation. 

	Students are neither children nor completely mature persons, that’s why a particular personal approach is required.
