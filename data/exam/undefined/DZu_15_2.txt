Nowadays, there is an opinion that the number of air travels should be reduced because air travelling is to blame seriously in air pollution and global warming.
As for me, I do not agree with this point of view. To my mind, air travelling is very useful and helpful for humankind, and the world society gets a lot of advantages from using it. For example, it is a common fact that the fastest travellings are made by air. Planes are irreplaceable in case of necessarity to get anywhere quickly. One more thing to be mentioned is that air travelling can be helpful in disasters and emergency situations. For example, fires in forests are usually stopped and striken down with the help of special air forces. It is also possible to evacuate people quickly from dangerous area by air. What is more, sometimes using planes for travelling can be cheap and useful to save money. For example, a lot of air companies accepts discounts for buying plane tickets in big passeger airplanes and for booking tickets in a big period of time before travelling.
On the other hand, air travelling can be dangerous. There were some big plane catastrophes with a lot of victims during the history of air flights. However, air travel harms to the Earthâ€™s nature and pollute our planet.
Honestly speaking, all kinds of travellings are dangerous and disasters on car, railway and water transport are met every single day. But it is possible to every kind of transport more secured and free of different risks, which is also done with air transport. Moreover, the same is about ecology: both air and all other kinds of travelling cause the nature pollution, but the level of it can be decreased by development of technologies and science.
To crown it all, I believe that humankind should hot reduce the amount of air travel because of its huge profits.
