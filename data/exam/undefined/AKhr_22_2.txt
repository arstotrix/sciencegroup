Nowadays it is a mainstream to think that government should provide full freedom of creation to talent artists. Many people suppose that only free art can be true art. But I disagree with this opinion. To my mind government should limit some artists. We live in the world where society have different traditions, laws, values. It is important to save these traditions and the art can help in this way. For example, we all know that russian people do not like people with other sexual orientation and I think that government should limit the exhibitions which show us nontraditional love. The other argument is that art is one of the most important institution of socialization. It directs the development of future generations. And it is necessary to control this institution by government. I suppose that government restrictions provide some safety in society. For instanse, if in society we will have fashism exhibitions and films it lead to broading this idea in society. But I am sure that government should provide different kinds of art in society, different styles of exhibitions, music, films. Individuals should have a choice between different art. To sum up, I would like to say that process of creation should not have any restrictions, but the process of public art should have. We cannot imagine our world in which all artists have exhibitions. To my mind, there should be no government limitations on what artists create, but they should be on what artist show public and society and public art should be limited.
