In my opinion, air travel effects environment badly and I agree that reducing amount of unnecessary flights using the law will protect us from greater air pollution and global warming.
Firstly, I would like to highlight the fact of enormous amount of unnecessary flights. As I fly a lot, I have witnessed many airplaines flying with almost no passengers on board. As I see it, waiting for all (or even half) tickets to be sold is not economicly good for airplain companies. Much more effort is gained while operating thouthands of half empty aircrafts.
Secondly, it is obviously that engine wastes pollute environment badly. It must be mentioned that planes consume tons of fuel and produce a lot of damaging elements while flying. The amount of damage cousing by one regular trans-city flight, as I heard, can be compared to 150 cars working 24 hours in a row.
Finally, I agree that some air travels are necessary. Goverment and citizents have a strong need in air plane flights because it is the only way to travel fast for a long distances which in our era of pernament lack of time turnes to be extremaly important for working, bussines or leisure activities, it i
Considering all the arguments, I can conclude that air travelling should be reduced using economical (higher fees) or law (restricting laws) methods or both. But air traveling definetely must not be banned totally.
