Nowadays health is very appreciated by everyone. There is an idea that increasing the number of sports facilities will improve situation. Some people have another point of view according to which this iniciative will not matter for public health. To my mind, growing in the number of sports facilities will affect public health in a good way.
   Firstly, sports facilities can be stated in yards or sports schools which are almost free. Talents of people can be developped and, moreover, some sportsmen may even become winners of different competions. This point matters greatly to the state. Secondly, not only children but also adults can use facilities. Children or teenagers look at adults exercising and think that it is a good example of behavior. They see that sports is more interesting way of life than destroying themselves with bad habits. Thirdly, the spaces with sports equipment will form public places where people can communicate to each other without problems. Urban scientists suppose that this point is very important in order to shape civil society.
   However, there is another point of view. People who have this opinion consider that sports facilities will not be useful. They think that people will not exercise regularly because they are very busy and, furthermore, the weather can not be always comfortable. Maybe, they will prefer fitness centre. That is why soports equipment is regarded as unnecessary development. More than that, the process of installation may become the reason of corruption among government representatives. This situation will probably had to the shortage of facilities of this kind.
   In spite of the fact that this issue is very discussive, I consider that sport facilities should be installed because the level of public health will increase. People who want to exercise will do that despite different causes. Moreover, corruption exists everywhere and this iniciative will not deepen this problem.
