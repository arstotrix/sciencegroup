Air travel is an essential part of humanâ€™s successgul well-being. This kind of travel os generally considered as one of the most perspective ways of travelling. However, it is often claimed that air travel is closely connected with air pollution and global warming as well. Consequently, some authorities suggest to restrict it. Nevertheless, I suppose that air travel is vital because of it provides fastness and comfort for its passengers. So I disagree with the idea that it should be banned by governments.
To start with, it is common knowledge that air travel is the most comfortable way of travelling nowadays. Moreover, its fastness should be also taken into account. For instance, I have a brilliant opportunity to spend no more than three hours on my trip to Chelyabinsk. Besides, during it I can sit alone and enjoy myself.
Speaking about air pollution, I need to mention that cars tend to be more harmful for air pollution than planes. Take, for example, the number of people who have cars and compare it with the number of those who can be able to travel by plane.
To sum up, I strongly believe that air travel must not be prohibitted.
