There is no doubt that almost all the countries have school education system. In many countries all the children must attend school classes. So everywhere ther is a question of bad behaviour among students. It makes us to ask why many schools all over the world have this problem.

There are some main reasons of such behaviour at school dealing with which society can solve the problem. Undoubtedly, there is strong pressure on students at school especially at high school, because pupils have to study a lot. They often are tired and stressed, so becoming aggressive, they niglect school rools. Furthermore, at some schools there can be problems with staff or discipline as a whole.  Spoilt relationships with teachers and traditions, habits to conflict with professors among students is a reason of permanent problems with teenager’s behaviour . Moreover, some schools are situated in poor districts of the city. Children from poor, uneducated families even don’t know how they should communicate with other people because their parents didn’t teach them.

From my point of view, the best way of resolving this problem for schools is to work together with parents. Teachers and family members should help with some problems of behaviour. Furthermore, school staff should remember how it difficult for children to pass through exams and enter university and try to resolve behaviour problems with kindness and advice, but not with punishment.

All in all, considering this issue we shouldn’t look for right or wrong side of the conflict. Society better should think about more appropriate means to change behaviour, discipline to better.
