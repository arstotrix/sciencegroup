The given bar chart provides us with an information about the number of children left with no access to primary school from 2000 to 2012 in different regions  and divided by gender. Obviously, education earned in primary school is the basis of an overall academic development of a child. Thus, this issue should be accurately examined. On this chart we can see an overall declining trend of the number of children with no opportunity get primary education in every single region. Moreover, a gender proportion of such children has changed through this period as there used to be considerably more such girls in every region while now it is quite even on the whole.
The next step after considering the overall trend is examing each region separately. Even after decreasing the number of children with no primary school access from 44 million to 33 million, which means a 25 per cent drop, Africa has remained its leading position among all regions. However, it is obvious that there has been a significant improvement through the considered period. Moreover, there are still more female kids who are left without basic education. Actually, this gap has remained equally the same compared to 2000. South Asia has managed to do the most impressive leap towards 100 per cent literacy among children. Decreasing this number by more than three times allowed this region to decrease this number by less than 10 million children. Rest of the world has slightly less impressive result, especially among boys. However, successful results among girls let this region reach an equal gender proportion in this issue.
To conclude, worldwide awareness of the importance of the access to primary school education is a strong and efficient (?) to fight this problem which results in providing more and more children with this opportunity.
