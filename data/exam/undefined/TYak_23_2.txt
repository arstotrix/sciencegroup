A human being – is a unique, intelligent creature of our planet. Nowadays there are about 7 billion people with different personality and behavior, who need an individual communication approach to get contact with. Now many schools face the problem of an unappropriate and violent behaviour of students that they need to solve, but thei must pay attention to the reasons of it and the possible ways of solution.

There are a lot of different causes of such type of behaviour – due to the family situation, connected with personal problems with friends or even with some problems of our modern world. First of all, the majority of behaviour problems depend on the way how children were raised by their parents – do they had some difficulties with getting on well with them, for example, a generation gap or just a misunderstanding problem. What is more, students can be under the pressure of their friends, that ask them to do some irrelevant things, such smoking or drinking alcohol, that person considers to be ??? or interesting. Moreover, nowadays a lot of students behave violent because of video games and some TV shows that “teach” them the wrong behaviour.

The possible solutions of such behaviour, on my point of view, is an educational communication with therapist who will suggest both sides of a behaviour of a student. Furthermore, parents also can have a talks with their son/daughter to understand his/her problem.

As far as I’m concerned, children with a violent behaviour should have a talk with some specialist to solve this problem, or he just need a person to follow in footsteps with.

In conclusion, I would like to say that to avoid this situation, and do not face violent behaviour in our society, we nee to avoid the causes of it.
