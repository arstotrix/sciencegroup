In our modern world people often face with different types of pollutions the environment. Air travel is becoming a significant problem, however I complitely disagree with this statement.
The first point is that air transports are essential for the goverment and society. It is one of the fastest way of achieving the place, moreover, it has a chance to provide enormous weigh of issues. For example, army’s equipments or large amount of art objects. The second argument is using other more dangerous technologies for contaminating air. Moreover, manufactories and companies, which are producing chemical materials, for instance fuel and TCFA, have a negotive influence on environmental conditions.
On the other point of view, planes and hellicopters cause terrible consiquences as global warming and destroying the up slice of atmosphere, which protects people from sunshine’s impact.
To sum up, air travel should not be banned, because these flights give more benefits for country as well as for each person. I am sure that science has an opportunity to find supplies, which will help to survive air and human’s health, avoiding serious environmental problems.
