Nowadays many people state that artists should express any ideas they want without any restrictions. Others believe that government should be in control of the situation.  I think that there should be ways to prohibit art if it can be consider harmfull.
First of all I’d like to mention that it is a very difficult to set a price for art but government often provides people an opportunity to study it. If private investors can’t pay enough money, government should be free to decide what forms of art it will support. We can not say if some piece of art will be valuable tomorrow and government can choose what will it support.  It can be seen that preservation of historical buildings and places is priceless.
Certain types of art can be very userfull for society. For example, literature can be make a person realize what is really important or to help some people deal with ethic issures.  On the other hand some ideas can lead to violence and destruction. We should prevent art from accepting such ideas because they can destroy our society. 
Some people say that freedom is the most valuable resource for artists. Moreover, they state that any restrictions are crimes against people. However, one of the reasons why government exists is that it must protect people. We know that violence and drugs are extremely harmful for any society but many artists can disagree and can convience people that drugs, for example, are socially acceptable.
All in all it can be said that it artist is actually a creator and makes a world a better place he should be allowed to do whatever he wants. But it a person just shares, destructive thouts, government should protect it citizens by any means.
