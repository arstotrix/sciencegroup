As nowadays travelling by air has been prooven to be extremely harmful for the enviroment some people state that governments all over the world should protect our planet by introducing laws which will help to reduce the amount of planes flying on business and leisure purposes.
On the one hand, the burning issues of air pollution and such problems as global warming should not be underestimated. In this case, motivating government to take it seriously and start acting for protection of the planet can be an important aim of the social community. As people will learn to be more accurate and reliable speaking and making decisions about enviromental problems it will become easier to for planet to survive. So from this point of view, insisting on introduction of laws that will reduce the scale of air travel can turn out to be beneficial for all of the spheres.
On the other hand, a serious approach to such big problem which influences not only enviroment but also global economy and travelling system all of the people are used to, requires science evidence that such significant decrease of air travel will be that efficient. Since there is no doubt that such radical decision will cause panic at the market, government should overthink the ways of stabilization and means of transport wich can partly replace planes. Due to such big number of drawbacks, it is a big question wether governement should make it legitimate to force the decline of travelling by air.
In conclusion, considering all of the benefits and drawbacks which introduction of laws reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure can cause it is rather a controversial issue if such measures are appropriate solution for the society.
