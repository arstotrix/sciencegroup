Nowadays a lot of schools have faced a problem of pupils’  behaviour.  students have become rude and impolite, they also can not interact with others correctly. This fact triggered a lot of social problems among the young people. But what are the reasons for such a behaviour?

Firstly, I suppose that the background of this problem refers to the family where the student lives. Family conditions influence significantly on person of young ages. For example, if the student’s parents did not pay attention to him, did not encourage him for his success, he can grow up a very closed and angry person because of lack of care in childhood.

Secondly, such a behaviour can be caused by the impact of Internet and social networks’ websites. For example, in Russia boys like to read such posts about role of women in the society. As a result, they do not consider girls as people who have right. Boys behave very impolite relatively to them.

I think that government and some social institutes should provide more information about the importance of tolerancy and kindness. Also school education can include some charity programs to bring up such qualities in young people.

To conclude, I would like to say that the situation is not very catastrophical. The behaviour is changing while we grow up. But still some aspects should be solved to predict the degradation of the society.
