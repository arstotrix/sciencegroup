   Public health has been the primary concern not only for humans but also for goverments all over the world. But there are always differents opinions, just like every coin has two sides.
   It`s a fact that not a lot of people visit sport centers to keep fit. The same situation could happend and with sport facilities – most of people will just ignore it. Also, it`s hard to combine sport and work. Most part of people just will not find any time for sport facilities. Finally, if sport facilities will not popullar and not a few people will visit it, that mean goverment will spend a lot of money for non-productive idea. And if goverment want to help their citizens, they must create something more effective than sport facilities.
   On the other hand, sport facilities will be very popular in younger group of population. Also, they have more time for sports than their parents, which work from 9 am till 9. Sport – is a new trend for teenagers. Sport facilities that are easily found and controlled can provide great convenience to people who have paucity to time to take physical exercises more flexibly. And you can choose every sport you like and find sport facilities. 
   Improving public health requires a combined effort and no single action can resolve the problem effectively. To resolve this problem, goverment need to create a complex of possible dessitions.
