The bar chart illustrates the dynamics of the number of children who could not get primary education due to region and gender between 2000 and 2012 years.
The general trend of the chart is a reduction of the number of children who didnâ€™t have an opportunity to get a primary education. However, the chances within boys were more dramatic. In the 2000 the highest rate of children without education was in Africa with 23.7 for girls and 20 for boys, while the lowest one in the rest of the world with 12.8 millions and 10.5 millions for girls and boys respectivelly. The most significant change happened in South Asia region where the number of boys and girls has fallen by four times and twice respectivelly.
