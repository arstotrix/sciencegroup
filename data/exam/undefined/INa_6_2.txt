Task 2
It is inevitable that the number of sports facilities available sis an important factor if the government is eager to improve public health levels. Nevertheless, it is more essential to take other measures into account, in particular sports education.
   To start with, it is arguably true that the ability to go to the gym, for instance, is one of the ways to keep in a good shape. If public can achieve an access to these kind of facilities provided by special government programmes, it will be very helpful, especially for socially unprotected strata of society. It is not obligatory to open auxiliaury sport clubs. It is enough to provide public schools with equipment required so that everyone could do sports there, both youngsters and adults. 
   On the other hand, all the measures which were mentioned above, will not give any positive results if people are not give any positive results if people are not intended to do exercises. That is why the primary objective of any public officials should be the advertisement of the healthy way of life. It includes not only gym attendance, but this is also about healthy diet. People often are not aware of the harm that fast food causes. Healthy life style education may improve the situation as right nutrition leads to a good physical and then phychological condition.
   To sum up, population on health rates are one of the governments dominant concerns. There are a lot of various measures that could be taken to increase these levels but people need to get interested first. And that is a real challenge.
