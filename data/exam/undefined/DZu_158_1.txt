The bar chart gives the information about the changes, concerning the number of children who donot have access to primary school education. The research was taken between 2000 and 2012 by gender and region.
There are six bars, which include the data about both boys and girls. Only two regions are presented on the graph: Africa and South Asia in comparison with the “Rest of World”. It can be surely said that tendention in making children an access to primary school is growing. It concerns all the regions. It also does not depend on gender. For example, in Africa in 2000 23,7 million girls and 20 million boys did not have such an opportunity to study. In 2012 6 million boy and 6 million girls more had that chance. A very interesting fact that the level of non-educated children in Africa in 2012 is approximately the same as in South Asia in 2000. The difference between South-asian level of children is very high (16 million for girls and 6 million for boys) in 2012 in comparison with 2000.
It is necessary to say that there is no discrimination of girls and boys, instead. What about Rest of World, the fact is 8 million children more in 2012 in comparison with 2000 have an access to the primary school in summary.
