Task 1
   These charts provide a breakdown of the proportion of various ages in Italy and Yemen in 2000 and predictions on their future situation.
   As we can see, a half of Yemen population is children aged under 14 years, whereas there are just under 15% of them in Italy. On the other hand, the percentage of the elderly is extremely low in the first country (3,6%) , while in Italy the figure coasist about a quarter of its population.
   Projections for future tend not to get change in a conciderable way. Nevertheless by 2050 there will have been just under 40% of children in Yemen, whereas the number of the people over 60 years will have increased by almost 2%. Italian population, conversely,will come across the decrease of youngsters and the significant growth in numbers of the elderly.
   To sum up, there is a clear tendency in population rates of Yemen and Italy. The Italian overall population age is ricing, while Yemen citizens will only saw a slight fall in children numbers.
