Writing task 1.
   The given pie charts show the proportions of populations falling in three distinct age groups in Yemen and Italy between 2000 and 2050.
   Firstly, as it can be seen the youth group, aged from 0 to 14 years old, took the biggest proportion of inhabitants in Yemen in 2000, representing around a half of the population (50.1 %). Meanwhile, the same age group in Italy represented only 14,3 %, that made it the least percentage at the same time. According to the predictions, the group of population, aged under 14, in Yemen will decrease with a significant fall of 13 %, while in Italy the same group will remain quite stable, just loosing less than 2 %.
   Secondly, it should be noticed that the middle-age has the positive trend in Yemen: starting with about 46 % in 2000, it will reach approximately 60 % in 2050. An opposite trend can be seen in Italy, the same age group will drop dramatically to the point of 46,2 % in 2050. However, Italians between 15 and 59 years old remains the largest group of inhabitants in these two years.
   To sum up, the growth of young people and decrease of elderly ones can be noticed in both countries.
