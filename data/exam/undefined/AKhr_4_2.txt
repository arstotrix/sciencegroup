Creative people are always trying to show the others how different they are by trying strange on, wearing bright coloured hair, making tatoos. All of these measures do not hurt someone's rights and couldn't be forbidden. But there are also such cases of expressing, which effect the society siriously. Should a government restrict the laws for such creative people or do they need not to be taken siriously. That is a problem I want to discuss in my essay. Many people say that it is normal for artists, singers and so on to be free in their expressions. Although, as for me, I do not understand this position. They especially need to demonstrate to people an example how to behave and what to do. Taking or selling drugs should not be forgived to some people only because the are creative. I think that we all live in society and have our own values, which could be not distroed by someone. Although, there are some cases, where the government restrict the laws even more for creative people. This is a case of "Pussy Riot", whos aim was to show creatively their position against governmental rule. As for me, there is no doubt, that their performance in a church is not something really intelligent, but such restrictions, arests also do not affect real hurt of that performance. So, I think, that we all are equal and all our actions have to be judged also equally. And it doen't matter if you are rich, creative, popular or something else.
