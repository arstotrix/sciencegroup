As everybody knows, going in for sports proves health. And now, it is needed to discuss, if it would be a good idea more sports facilities.
   On the one hand, it would be more convenient for people to have a lot of sports centers near the places, where they live. So, citizens would have more opportunities to go to gym or to visit swimming pools. Moreover, not only older people can spend time in sports centers. Teenagers and even children would also have an opportunity to visit sports facilities, such as stadiums or professional playgrounds. Because it is necessary for them to grow up heathier. Plus, nowadays professional sportsmen earn a lot of money, so doing sports could be a job.
   On the other hand, building sport facilities would have no effect on public health. For example, people just can ignore the increased number of fitness centers. In fact, nowadays people have not so much free time to spend. Plus, doing sports is not a cheap way of spending time.
   It is unlikely to be truth, but nowadays teenagers, who are doing sports professionally, are involved in taking drugs and drinking alcohol. As for me, I am a professional swimmer, and I know a lot of m teammates who smokes and drinks alcohol. In fact, those people who really work in the swimming pool are more likely to become successful.
   To sum up, I have discussed two points of view of increasing the number of sports facilities. I have noticed all advantages and disadvantages of this measure. To my mind, it is not necessary to build more sports centers, because it is enough number of them in our city. In fact, it would be better to use other measures, such as creating new laws.
