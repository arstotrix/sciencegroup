Task 1.
The charts show changes in the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy according 50 years from 2000 to 2050.
   The situations in two different countries are not similar. There are a lot of differences between proportions of ages in Yemen and Italy. There were just over 50% people from 0 to 14 years in Yemen in 2000 and only 3, 6% people older then 60. Whereas in Italy in the same time there were only 14, 3% people from 0 to 14 and more than 20% people older than 60.
   More significant figure to look at is how will be increase the percent of 60+ years people in Italy in 2050 in comparison with 2000. It will rise in double. In contrast, there are will be only 5, 7% of old people in Yemen in 2050. This percent just over more than the percent of old people in Yemen in 2000. The same stagnative situation in ages from 0 to 14 in Italia. Nevetheless there is a rising tendention of people from 15 to 59 years old fron 2000 to 2050 in Yemen.
   In summary, charts give us different information about ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050. There are two most important figures: rising the quantity of people from 15 to 59 in Yemen and rising the quantity of people older than 60 in Italy.
