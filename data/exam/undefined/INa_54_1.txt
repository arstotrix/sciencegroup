Task 1.
   The chart shows the real age in 2000 and predictable age in 2050 of Yemen and Italy citizens.
   In comparison with the year 2000 the number 15-59 years old Yemen citizens is going to grow from 46,3 % to 57,3 % of population. While the younger groop with the age of 0-14 is going to become smaller in the future. The number of people, who are over 60 years old is going to become bigger. This age groop with contain 5,7 % of population in … of 3,5 %, that it did in 2000.
   However, Italy shows a different situation. In this country the nomber of 15-59 year olds is supposed do shorten. Whereas, the nomber of elderly people will rise almost twice, from 24,1 % to 42,3 %. The nomber of children will be 2,8 % smaller than it was.
   To sum up, the percantage of each population groop will change and in different countries this change won’t be the same.
