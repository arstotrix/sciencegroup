   There is a growing concern about public health and its improvement in the world today. There is many ways to do it and one of this is creating new sports facilities and increasing their number. The purpose of this essay is two discuss two different views on this problem and outline of sports facilities for health of population.
   Nowadays there are many types of sports facilities, which are offered by government and they all are open for population. It can be clearly seen that the football stadiums, running facilities, basketball and volleyball places are in almost every yard of housing sectors with the same in central part of cities, special programs in schools which is taught children different sports activities, organizing sports team among them is also an attempt to improve their health. Increasing of sports facilities and opportunities is the right way to attract people’s attention about what have been done, but not improve their health.
   In contrast to this it can be said, that the question of using the sports facilities by people, which were built for them is the personal choice of each man. Due to this, the method of increasing number of sports facilities can be not effective. If public is passive these attempts will not lead to good result.
   For my opinion, increasing the number of sports facilities is the best way for creating access for those who interested in it and ready to use it with further improvement of own health. On the other hand, it will be not effective for those who doesn’t like sport or doesn’t know how it works.
   Taking everything into consideration it can be outlined that providing more facilities for sports activities is a good idea but not ever effective. To improve it in relations to take the main result – improving public health, it must be connected with another performances which must attract the attention of people to their use.
