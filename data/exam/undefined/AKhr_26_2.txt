Nowadays, there are a lot of ways to express yourself. However there are those who believe that there should be some rules that in some way should restrict the people in expressing their own vision of the world. First of all, I strongly believe that making restrictions on the artists work in some way will decrease the possibility of making masterpieces for artists. As I am sure that really talanted artists see the world in a very specific way and only such unusual expression of the world can be really valuable and can become the greatest work. Moreover, if we understand by the word "restrictions" the government wish to say what subjects and issues should not be talked about then it is ideology. I think that such types of restrictions can lead to the appearance of hundred ordinary art works. On the other hand, I can say that there should always be a control by the government in way that people should know that they cannot afford themselves to do everything they want and call it an art. For example, I was told about a man who used to paint his body with different colours and go naked to the park. He called himself a "child of nature". There is no doubt that he scared people around him. To conclude, I believe that there should be one main restriction - not to make harm to other people while expressing your own ideas.
