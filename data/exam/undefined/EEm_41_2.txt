Nowadays a lot of people are travelling by plane all around the world. The reasons are different - from just a holidays to business and leisure deals. But there is a question what is more important to save a planet or don’t change a number of air travels. As for me, the quantity of air travells should be stable.
The first reason for my opinion is the fact that a lot of important meetings are made by people who are living in different countries. They don’t have another way to get a special place. But these deals couldn’t be canceled because the economy or other important spheres of life depend on it.
Secondly, it is more comfortable to travel by plane. It doesn’t spend a lot of time. For example a boss of company “X” has to be in 5 hours in other side of the world. Logically he will use a plane.
There are people who stand for another opinion. They think that people have to care about their travels some time before what will help to reduce the number of air travels. I actually don’t agree because there are some situations which you don’t expect when you need to fly to other (?) emidiatelly.
To sum up, I don’t recommend to change something in airplane industry, like a reduce of air travel, because it can lead to bad consequances. Specialists at this sphere can change some inside details of plane to reduce air pollution and global warming.
