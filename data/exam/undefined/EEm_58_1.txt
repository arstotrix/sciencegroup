The bar chart represents the amount of boys and girls who were not able to get primary education in different parts of the world in 2000 and 2012.
The general trend is quite obvious: as the time passed, more children have had access to acquire basic knowledge in primary schools. However, there are some main features that should be mentioned. As for Africa, 23.7 millions of girls did not get primary education compared to 20 millions of boys in 2000. There was a moderate decline twelve years later but the trend concerning the proportion of young males and females remained the same. One more interesting point is that in South Asia more than 21 millions of girls did not have a permission to study in comprehensive schools and it is twice as much as boys. In 2012 there was a dramatical change and the amount of children who got primary education increased in several times.
In general, during the dozen years more and more children got the access to primary school education. Despite some noticable changes, the tendancy is almost the same in Africa, South Asia and in the rest part of the world.
