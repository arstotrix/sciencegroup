Writing task1.
   The pie charts show the demographic situation in Yemen and in Italy. We can see the percentage of age categories living in Yemen and in Italy in 2000 and predictions presented in the pie charts too for 2050.
   According to the data, half of Yemen population were under 14 years old in 2000, and people from 15 to 59 years were close to 50 percent. However, projections for 2050 provide quite different proportion, a percentage of young people is expected to decrease, and a part of  older categories will rise. As for Italy, almost two-third of residents had working age from 15 to 59 years in 2000. At the same time, much larger percent of above 60-year people lived in Italy, 24,1 percent against 3,6 percent from Yemen. Consequently, young Italians occur little part of population, just 14 percent. So, prediction  for 2050 demonstrates not good demographic expectations. Over 40 percent will be above 60 years old, a percentage of working age residents will fall by 15 percent. Furthermore, young category will have less part in proportion.
   Thus, we can see negative tendention of increasing part of population and decreasing of young in both researched countries Yemen and Italy. Projections for Italy may call dramatic to economic view.
