I think that government should reduce the amount of air travel for business and especially for leisure. Because plane engine and all related mechanism produce a lot of fossil gases that has a great negative effect on our environment.
Firstly it is important to note that air traveling are very popular nowadays, so it has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. Millions of people use planes for leisure or business every hour, but a lot of planes have empty seats that give an ability to reduce the rate of air travel significantly.
Some people like like travel by plane because it safety fast & fichets are about equal another types of transport or just little more expensive, but they are don't mind about environmental problems and all what it takes. The strongest example is Global warming.
This environment disaster worryed sciencist around the world since early zeroes of 21 century. Because of Earthquakes, Tsunami,, Tornado and floods. All of this natural disasters are related to Global warming. So government may introduce some laws to regulate the amount of air travel. For example they may have a negative with all big airlines companyes for refactoring air rates simultaneosly.
To sum up. Global warming is a great and terrifying disaster, but governments may help world and all of us introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure.
And I totall y agree with this point of view, because our environment can't care about itself while people are changing our planet every second. So simple people, children, parents whole countries should take care about our environment — our Planet — our Home.
