Nowadays air pollution and groball warming are the main issues in the world. Some people think that the cause of these problems is air travel and goverment should anounce laws to reduce the amount of air travel in some cases. I personally disagree with this statement for two reasons.
First of all, it is true air travel has influence to these problems, but I think the main issue id people, who can not take care of our nature and polute air through cigarettes, cars, rabbish on the streets of the city. People have many different reasons do not keep our city in clear, so many children and adults have many deseases in this reason. Thus, in our world we have some organizations such as “Green peace” and others, which provide the idea to save and support the solving air pollution problems in the world.
With respect to the second reason, I believe that plane is the most comfortable and fast transport when people deal with business and leisure. Moreove, I have a private cause why I think so, it is because I study in Moscow, while my family live in another country. Also, there are many families, which was separate for different causes and air travel can to solve this problem. Nevertheless, it is true that sometimes there are some accident, which reduce the level of population.
In conclusion, the goverment can reduce the amount of air travel but it is not the solving the problem totally.
