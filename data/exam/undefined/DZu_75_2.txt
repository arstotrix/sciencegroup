Our world has a lot of advantages and people have different possibilities. They can travel, can visit a lot of different countries. In our days air travel is more popular than bus travel or train travel, because it is more comfortable. But air travel is harmful for environment. I agree that it has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming.
Air pollution is a global problem which should be resolved. The development of our society is high and people can do what they want. I think that it is very bad because they do not think about our world. Some people think that a lot of air travel is unnecessary, but I can not say it. I do not think that governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. I think that all people can use air travel when they have a necessarity for it, It governmnets should introduce laws, it will not resolve the problem of air pollution and global warming. Only people can resolve this problem. If all people will protect the environment, we will not say about these global problems. In our time people a lot work, they are very busy. There are a lot of people who have business and they have to use air travel very often. There are people who like to travel and it is hobby for them. All people sometimes use this means of transportation and it is necessary for them.
In conclusion, it is right that there is a lot of unnecessary, but air travel is not sphere in which government should do any changes. Governments should not introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure.
