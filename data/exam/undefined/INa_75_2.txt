In the modern world there is a concerning problem regarding to the public health that is needed to be improved. So, there are different views on this problem and its possible solution.
   Some people believe that only by increasing the amount of sports facilities public health will reach the higher level. Of course, doing sport every day may have a positive influence on person`s health. Nowadays it is seemed to be that people do not have enough time for any sports activities due to very stressful and crazy lifestyle. They are so exhausted after work that they preface a passive rest, like watching TV or simply liying on a sofa. In this case, people need to move actively for being healthy. On the other hand, there is an opposite opinion saying that the increasing number of sport facilities is not the best way to solve such problem. The argument is that not all the people are able to do sport and have efficient time for it. So, it should be done something more for improving public health.
   Personally, I agree with the opposite view because I believe that most of people will not be encouraged and motivated to do sport, if the government offers` more sports facilities. I think that people should focus not only on sport but also be encouraged to adopt a healthy lifestyle.
   They should eat more vegetables, fruits and meat accept of sweets and junk food. Also it is possible to reach their, for example, workplaces not using private cars but going there by feet.
