A bar chart below demonstrates us the educational situation in Australia in 1999, comparing man and women. On the x-axis we can see the percentage of men or women, who has a special level of education, namely, master's or bachelor's degrees, postgraduate, undergraduate and skilled vocational diplomas, which are demonstrated on the y-axis. From the graphic, it becomes understandible, that the women are tending to receive school diploma, or bachelor's degree more often, than men. So, undergraduate diploma has twice so many women, as men. But we can see a controversial situation in the case of postgraduates, where one-third of females has it and almost two-third of men also. Although, the most dramatic difference could be seen in case of skilled vocational diploma. 90 per cent of people, who receive it are men, and only 10 per cent refers to women. Nevertheless, we can notice a tendency of receiving more serious diplomas by men, because females are not trying to take master degree so often.
