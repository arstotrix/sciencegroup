The chart shows some information about post-school qualifications which men and women chose in Australia in 1999.
The most popular qualification for men was skilled vocational diploma. There were more than 90% of men. However the number of women studying for undergraduate diploma and Bachelor’s degree was bigger than the number of men. It was about 70% of women on undergraduate diploma and 56% on Bachelor’s degree. To say more the proportion of men and women studying on Postgraduate diploma is similar with proportion of people studying on skilled vocational diploma, and the difference is only about 15% in amount of men and so in women. The last degree is Master’s degree and the percent of men studying it is 60, so there are 40% of women.
We can see that difference in proportion of men and women are very big on all qualifications except of Bachelors’s degree, the proportion of men and women on this qualification was practically the same .
