Childhood is a very difficult period of time for everybody. The problem of children’s behaviour is very popular now because the type of life of children changed and their behaviour became worse. So, schools stay face to face with this problem, because where are a lot of children. Below I will mention some causes and desisions of this problem.

First of all, the changing of the society lead to changes in pupils lifestyle. Modern adults are big children. So, pupils copy adults’ behaviour, don’t go on rules line burglars, thievs and others. The invention of TV also changed the overall surrounding, because TV is another source of “bad information”, which can be copied by students.

I tend to think that government should control the Internet content, computer corporations should produce new programmes, which can save pupils from violence and unappropriated  behaviour.

Moreover, the changes in the education system, which we can abserve in many countries, like in Russia, also made situations with the problem, mentioned before worse. It happens because new system gives pupils too much freedom. Children have a lot of time for leisure activities, like computer games (where a lot of violence), watching TV.

So, if we want to solve this problem, government should return some old educational programs, which allow to control behaviour of students in better way.

To conclude, we should change the whole situation in the world, if we want to improve the way how children behave, because children are the mirror of the adults. So, surrounding is the main thing, which influence on children.
