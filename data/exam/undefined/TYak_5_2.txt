Nowadays in our fast moving world the problems connected with students’ behaviour become more and more severe and indispensible. Of course there are several causes of unappropriate behaviour. To my mind that issue has to be solved because otherwise it can cause other more serious social problems. 

	There are several causes of the problems connected with students’ behaviour. To start with, in many modern schools students sufter from lack of sleep and rest that can lead to destruction of nerves’ system, making students behave themselves in a wrong way. What is more, it is a common knowledge that, in our world of high-technologies, students easily get addicted to new games and brand new mobile phones and gadjets that can also cause unappropriate behaviour. Last but not the least cause is that parents just can not find the right way to grow up their children, they let them do what they want that is a crucial mistake. As a result there are students without any respects, thinking that they are the centre of the Universe.

	Some things must be done to solve that problem. Firstly, parents have to spend more time with their children trying to make them abide all the main social rules of behavior. Secondly, they have to control the time that their children spend using computers or mobile phone because it seriously damages their phycology, causing the problem of behaviour. 

	To sum up, the main aspect of stated issue can be easily solved by students’ parents giving them possibilities to grow up as intelligent people. In that case, schools will no longer suffer from problems with students’ behaviour.
