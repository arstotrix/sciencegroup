So, in my country artists have not enough freedom to express their own ideas nowadays, and we can see that russian music, films and other art-production is not so popular like art in foreign countries. May be it is not only because of government restriction, may be we did not have genious artists, but i think the main reason is deficit of freedom in their minds. For example – “Mosfilm”, who do not give grown up talented producers and writers, they only accept Nikita’s Michalkov films, because he does, what government says him to do. 
From the other side, some artists can start doing something ammoral, if you give them too much freedom. They called this art for elite, and said that you can’t understand so wonderful art. People don’t like this, they feel sad if they don’t understand, they start to think that they are worse then other. I think it’s useless art which only can make you depression. Government know more than me, so i think they have better reasons for their restrictions on “artist way”. So, in my opinion genious artists can make their “creatures”  with or without this thing, what you called the “freedom”.
