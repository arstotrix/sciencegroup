This graph illustrates the situation with post-school qualifications in Australia. We can see the difference between men and women education levels. Only eleven percent of females have vocation diploma. The number of men much more. It is about ninety percent. In over categoryes the difference is not so big. Bachelor's degree have the equal number of people. Postgraduate diploma have seventy percent of men and twenty eight percent of women. Sixty percent of men have their master's degree. At the same time only fourty percent of women have this degree. It is very interesting that number of women with their undergraduate diploma much more than men. Seventy percent of females have this kind of education. And we can see that only fourty percent of men have it. There is only one category with such resaultes. So this chart shows that there are a lot of women with some lack of education in Australia.
