Nowadays more and more teachers are facing student behavoural problems. There have been suggested many ways to avoid them, but there is no one which could watch every student, so everything depends on the exact situation. Speaking about causes of behavoural problems, I would say there are two main causes: parents are teachers themselves. Conflicts appear when there are completely different atmosperes at school and at home. At home parents sometimes can be not strict enough and at school, vice versa, teaches can be too strict to pupils expect to be treated everywhere. There are also many cases when student have difficult situations at home (for instance, bad relations with family members), and at the same time too kind teachers who can do nothing with pupils bad behaviour caused by negative emotions from home.

 But also there are situations when everything seems to be perfect, when parents take care of their children, they get high marks and do not have any serious conflicts with teachers. Though suddenly such students can let the emotion do off. Such cases are happening more and more often. Recently such kind of situation has taken place when a successful pupil took a gun and shot down a teacher. That pupilâ€™s stres.
