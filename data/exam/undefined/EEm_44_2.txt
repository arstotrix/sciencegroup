Nowadays there is a great problem all over the world connected to the air pollution caused by planes. As everybody knows travelling by plane is most comfortable and convenient way of reaching any place. However, more and more people vote for government to make new laws against air travelling. Personally I am for travelling by air for numerous reasons.
First of all, not only planes pollute the atmosphere, both trains and cars do the same. In addition to this argument, it takes more time to get to your destination by car so it produces more oxygen. Secondly, there are places on our planet which are unreal to get to not by air. So some people who have a desire to visit new places wpuld not have such opportunity. What is more, government, can introduce laws agains wasting, which also lead to serious environmental problems on the Earth, for example, water pollution.
Contrary to my arguments, sometimes air companies offer too many flights per day to one destination, so that some planes fly almost empty. In this case, I think, governments can make some laws which would not allow planes with small amount of people fly.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that I strongly believe that governments care about our planet and want to do its best, but some thing are not real. For example, everybody enjoys travelling and flying on plane and for many people it is inreplaceble part of leisure activities. I hope that government would find better ways for solving such a big problem as global warming and air pollution.
