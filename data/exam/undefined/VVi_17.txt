To begin with, there are many people in Russia and in the world which believe that very artist should have the freedom of expressing his thoughts and his view on the life. However, people who opposw this idea think that government should regulate the creations of different types of artists. As far as I am concerned, there is no one right answer to this question. Some points of supporters and people who oppose them are close to me. So, looking at both sides are very important.
As matter of the fact, creative people have other viewing of life. They try to express their thoughts and opinions by writing poems and novels, painting pictures, dancing or singing. As far as I know, there are a lot of people, who were pressed by government by their creations. But some of these people are really very known today, for example, Vladimir Vysotsky, Osip Mandelshtump, Nikolay Gumilev and others. So, time came and know we realise that their place in our culture is very high.
Speaking about people, who believe that government should control the artists, they are right in some points. Of course, we live in the country of “modern culture” when people have no boundaries in their thoughts. There are some topics which are very popular today but which should be controlled. I speak about sex and erotic, for instanse, or about cruel and violent creations. Public shouldn’t see it.
To my mind, It is very difficult to see a broad between things which are normal and others. As far as I understand, every artist should think about his responsibility in front of the face of society for his creations.
To sum up, the question about the amount of the freedom that should be given to creative artists is really disputible. There are two groups of people which will argue and argue. Speaking about me, I have no one steadly position. To my mind, I should more experience and knowlage to make a undoubtable conclusion.
