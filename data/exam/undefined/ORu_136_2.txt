To begin with that there is a problem of modern families. Nowadays children spend less time with parents than they did in the past. There are two opinion about this problem. Some people think that it is true and often children spend thire time alone. But other people consider that children spent time with parent in the past and spend nowadays. I agree with the first opinion. We can see that modern generation forget their parents. All days, when both parents go out to work their child stay at home alone or with computer. Many of us understand that out parent stay more older, but we want to spend our time with father or mother. How to say modern generation, “it is not interesting for us”. But we can see other hand this problem. Many parents, when go out to work, they take their children and go to cinema, theatre or some other places. I think that problems conse. Such as children not to understand their parent, they spend a lot of time  with friends, in computer games. They stay more stupid. As you can see, our generation. In many families children all day alone. I think that it is large mistake for parents. To sum up, I want to say that our parent must to take part in our life and spend their free time with us.
