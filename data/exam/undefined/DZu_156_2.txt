Over the last few years the problem of air pollution and global warming had an essential influence in global regulation and air travel too. I agree with some extent withe the position to reduce the total number of travelling by plane. This is due to the fact that our world today is global and some international law tretings or agreements in this sphere will proceed a new global problems in business and leisure kinds of everyday people’s life.
In my point of view, the air transport has a very significant role in our world’s life. This is because people moving from state to state in significant dimensious today. This could result in a greatly air and water pollution that’s enceolues an important international issue of temperature decreasing. The fact is that these processes are influenced in global warming point. It follows that air transport’s teeh involves oil and other materials that effects on environmental area. A common opinion that governmental policy in different states must provide an effective strategy to declined the number of businesses and inquel air moving is not real and succesfull in my personal point of view. On my opinion governments must realised a infinsificative scientific researches to dedide this problem.
