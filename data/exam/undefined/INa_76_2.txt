   It is certainly true that people need to improve their health all the time. One of the possible solutions is to make more sports facilities. However, other consider that it will not help to solve this problem and there will be other methods for improving public health.
   On the one hand, increasing the number of sport facilities is a good way for making peoples health better. Boys and girls could visit different sports sections and play in their favourite games. The time spent on watching TV and sitting in front of the computes will definetely decrease. For example, when my brother began to visit the football playing computer games. Moreover, he became stronger.
   On the other hand, not all people have got enough money for visiting sports clubs. For instance, if the government and businessmen open more fitness clubs, there will not be much more women visiting its, because abonements are rather expensive. Futhermore, old people can not visit sport sections because of their health.
   Hence, there will another methods for improving public health. I consider that the government should think about making more medical services. Increasing the number of competent doctors is another way for solving this problem. Besides, all medical tablets should be available for people.
   From my point of view, increasing the number of sports facilities is not enough for improving health. Competent doctors, available tablets and good medical services are required.
