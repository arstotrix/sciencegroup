The graph illustrates the dynemics in the number of kids and teenagers who were not able to receive education in primary schools from 2000 to 2012. The chart also compares accessibility of primary school education among boys and girls from different regions.
Generally speaking, the amount of kids who live without access to school education has decreased from 2000 to 2012. It is important to point that in all regions the number of girls for whom learning in schools is impossible due to the lack of access mainly outweigh the boys who has faced the same situation in 2000. However, things change completely in 2012 and our world face the situation when the percentage of non-educated boys and girls is nearly the same with a minimum difference.
To sum up, the situation with primary school education has changed dramatically and more kids in 2012 are able to learn in educational institutions. What is more, girls have more access to the process of learning in primary schools.
