   Nowadays huge interest in improving the public health is rising. While the majority of people around the world have the same aim, there are arguments about which way of improving the public health is more effective. Increasing the number of sport facilities is one of the solutions, the effectivenece of which became a point of a large discussion.
   There is no doubt, that high amount of sport facilities will have an effect on public health. The more facilities that public can choose from the more significant grow of attention to sport will be. My personal view is that there is a suitable kind of sport for everyone, but the promlem of choice stays.
   On the other hand, people that have doubts about the effectiveness of sport make sense. As a man, who went in for different kinds of sport, I saw another situation. Half of my friends who took part in professional sport spoiled their health rather than improved it. We also shouldn`t forget a big amount of people that are not interested in sport, they will have no use of this facilities at all.
   To sum up, I would like to say that sport facilities are necessary for people who like sport. But it is important to make sure that there are also other ways of improving health for those who don`t like sport, or cannot take part in other for reasons.
