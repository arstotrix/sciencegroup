The pie charts describe situation in different age groups of two countries: Yemen and Italy in two periods â€“ 2000 and 2050.
   In Yemen people at the age of 0-14 have 50.1% in 2000, this is the biggest percentage in 2000. Then goes people aged 15-59 with 46.3%. The smallest percentage is for people who are 60+ years old. If to speak about predictions, the situation may change and the biggest percentage will be for people at the age of 15-59.
   If to compare with Italy, there is another situation. People at the age of 15-59 have the biggest percentage in 2000 (about 61.6%). Then goes age group of 60+ years, the last place takes people aged 0-14. Projections show great changes in two groups: percentage of people aged 15-59 may cut down to 46.2%, percentage of people aged 60+ years will rise and almost double to 42%. The third group will change a little and will have 11.5%.
   To sum up, the population of Yemen is becoming younger and younger. On the other hand, the population of Italy is ageing and getting older.
