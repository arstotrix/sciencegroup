Writing Task 1
   The information on charts shows us the portion of ages of population. This charts include population from 0 to 14 years, 15-59 years and 60 and over years. As we can see information is about two countries: Yemen and Italy. So, charts indicates ages of population in 2000 and planned for 2050. In Yemen, age of younger population has the bigger percentage than other older population, it`s 50,1%. 
   Besides, the portion of people 15-59 is also huge and plays important role in this chart in 2000 year in Yemen, Its 46,3% Also, in 2050 population of people from 15 to 59 will increase and may bigger ,than the people of  0-14. The chart in 2050 shows 57,3% , and this is majority of  all the population, and the percentage of  0-14 years will decrease in 12,9 until 2050. And, how we can observe in first chart in 
Yemen, the smallest percentage of population is older people from 60 and higher, so, we can say with no doubt that this category of people have not so many changes at all.
   Another situation we can observe in Italy, where age of people 15-59 years is considerable. Amount of people in 2000 from 0 to 14 is scanty, (compar) if we compare with older generation. And, in 2050, generation of people, who older than 60 will increase and reach 42,3% , and plays important role in population. The bigger quantity of people from 15 to 59 in 2000 will decrease in 2050 in Italy, and younger generation will decrease too, but no so considerable.
