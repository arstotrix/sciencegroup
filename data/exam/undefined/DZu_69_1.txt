Millions of Children are not able to gain access to primary schools in their regions. This issue was partly solved, but yet huge amount of children remain without a chance to enter the school. Africa was one of the most undeveloped regions on planet Earth, and still undeveloped even today. But, according the graph, we see something that can be called “progress”, from 23,7 millions boys without access to schools to 18,2. For girls – from 20 millions to 14,5. And that is a result of 12 years development. The most significant and the most rapid change in the level of access to primary schools can be seen in South Asia. In the year 2000, amount of boys without access to schools was 21,6 millions, allmoust like Africa at the same year, But 12 years later, this number lowered, I would say dropped, crashed. From 21,6 millions to 4,8. Girls in South Asia experienced the rise of opportunities to enter primary school. Numbers dropped from 11,1 millions in 2000 to 5,1 million in 2012, allmoust twice. Rest of the world shows us mediocte results. During 12 years of development we may see the dropping numbers for boys (from 12,8 millions to 7,6 mill.) and girls (from 10,5 mill. To 7,7 mill.). If I had to make a comparison, I would say, that in percentage the development level of Africa and rest of the world was the same.
