Which one of us did not travel with an airplane? There are not many people who will answer “Yes” on this question. However, some people believe that there is more disadvantages than advantages in air travelling. Others are sure that there is no need to reduce the amount of air travel. In this essay, the positive and negative aspects surrounding this issue will be discussed.
Firstly, it is necessary to mention that our world has become really united by business, families and friends for the last 30 years. Many of us have siblings in other countries, some people work in international companies or even own them. They all can not imagine their life without airplanes as it is the most comfortable and fast way to visit friends or to go to a conference.
It can be not very obviously, but air travelling is the safest type of transport. Many people are afraid of travelling by airplanes because there are many shocking news showed on TV about crashes. However, it is a fact that there are much more people who died in their cars or while travelling by trains. So air travelling is really can be called the safest way of travelling.
On the other hand, air pollution and global warming is much more important problem as it can be the reason of a catastrophe and destroy everything on our planet. And if air travel has been proven to contribute to this great problem, maybe goverments should really care about this and reduce the number of flights. At least, they can prohibit almost empty airplanes to fly.
In conclusion I would like to say that, in my humble opinion, there should not be a great decrease in the number of flights, because it can be a reason why many people will not be able to see their family and friends or to do their job.
