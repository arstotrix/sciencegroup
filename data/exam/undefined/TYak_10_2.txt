Nowadays more and more schools face with problems of student behaviour. Some people think that the reason for that is bad school programmes.  But other people don’t share this point of view. They think that children’s behaviour depends mostly on family. But who is right? Let’s discuss different options.

School programmes have a lot of disadvantages. This thesis can not be denyed. But can school programmes lead to problems with student behaviour. I think it can be one of the most segnificant cause of this.

Firstly, school shedule pay more attention to academic subjects and ??? to different activities. But children who can’t waste their energy on different activities such as football, tennis and other kinds of games have more problems with behaviour. Secondly, schools are considered students to be patient and silent and don’t give an opportunity for children to show their emotion. This is totally wrong because children have to be active. Moreover, schools often punish students for doing mistakes. It leads to growth of aggression among children. Students have to make mistakes because mistake is the most important part of learning process.

On the other hand, we also have family as an important part of socialization. Problems in family can affect behaviour of students badly. So, I supposed family to be the cause of behaviour problems. First of all, children spend most of their time in family which influence children different ways. If family are not friendly it is hard to see them friendly and happy in school. Furthermore, parents sometimes punish children severely for bad behaviour. It can result in problems with students’ behaviour.

In conclusion, It has to be pointed out that there are a lot of causes of bad behaviour. It is very hard to struggle all of them. But we have to pay more attention to children and love them. Also the most important point is to give children more freedom. We also have to try to understand children despite all complications.
