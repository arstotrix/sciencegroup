The issue about freedom of arts is rather controversial. On the one hand there are those who claim, that there should be no obstacles for artists to proclaim their viewpoint on any aspect of life. On the other hand, some people think that this extreme independance could get out of moral or even legislative borders. As for me, I'm sure that government shouldn't influence the sphere of arts, if it doesn't contradict the current law system. First of all, the freedom of speech and self-expression is a key point in development of so-called "information society", where all views and opinions are taken into consideration. This will allow people to know some stance, alternative to their own one. The second argument is that if some government consider itself as a "democrate" one, it should keep to democratic principles and do not restrict artists in doing what they want to. The most obvious, but nevertheless strong argument is that interruption in "the process of creating" is a direct violation of Geneva Convention rules, which state about personal independence and thus right of speech too. Despite this, there is surely another point of view on this problem. Some may think that certain works, for example those which are created by radical artists, can be beyond any morality, and that is unacceptable for them. I can only halfly agree with that, I guess, if some film or music is violent and aimed at setting conflicts among individuals or between social groups then it should be banned by the government. As for my experience, I know a lot about neo-nazi hardcore musical bands whose songs are really aggressive toward sexual minorities, this is an example of "artists" that should be banned or even prosecuted.
