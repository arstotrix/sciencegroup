Facing problems with student behavior is rather crucial trend in schools of many modern countries. A lot of psychologists, sociologists and people directly related to this question, such as teachers or parents, argue on what are the causes of such misbehaviour and what solutions can be suggested.

First of all, according to my personal experience, the most burning cause of misbehaviour can be the problem with socialization. Under that I mean a total misunderstanding between individual and his classmates or his teachers. The only solution of this question I see in providing every school with a professional psychologist, who will help such children to pass the process of socialization and to overcome difficulties, which they are facing in this field.

Moreover, dull and not interesting classes, each of teacher’s confidence are, also, the obvious causes of children’s misbehavior. If student is not surprises that he distracts his attention on other things, such as chatting, playing e.t.c. that is why, to my mind, modern teachers have to find all the possible ways of attracting students’ attention and interest otherwise they will face with problems of misbehaviour.

Overall, no doubt, there are some “bully” Children, whose inborn nature is misbehaviour and in that case it is really hard to find the solution. But, the fact is, that overwhelmingly the main causes of behaviour problems lie in the socialization field and there the both sides of the process (teachers and students) have to do their best to overcome difficulties and to reach harmony.
