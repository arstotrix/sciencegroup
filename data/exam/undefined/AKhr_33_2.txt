Nowadays great number of people are sure that creative artists should be free to share their ideas an views with society. This thought is quite controvercial and I agree with it only partly. From the one side, there is no doubt that there should not be any government limits or sanction for artists. Their free creativity allows them to make wonderful peaces of art, music or unpredictable multidimentional instalation. There are many examples of creative artists who made a breakethrough in understanding of art and became famous, i.e. Kazimir Malevich, Olga Rozanova, Vincent Vangog. Otherwise, if artists have no freedom to express their ideas, we cannot see any development but many fairless fates. Let us take for example the histori of Soviet Union art. From the other side, I consider that the government should limits some contemporary artists to prevent different scandals. We can remember the action of one artist from St.Petersburg on the Red Square. There was much nioce about it. Moreover, some restriction can help art to develop by setting frames which artist should override. I am sure it is doubt lessly positive trend. To sum up, I consider that the government should find a suitable proportion between restrictions and artists freedom which help art change and develop and limit lack of morality of contemporary art at the same time.
