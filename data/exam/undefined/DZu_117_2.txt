Some people claim that air travel is one of the reasons of air pollution and global warming. It is not significant part between the reasons, causes global warming and air pollution.
Planes do not pollute air too much. Earth can recycle it. Air travel give some troubles for the planet, but it is not huge amount in contrast with others. For instance, different fabrics and electric stations pollute air much more than air travel. Other source of air pollution is cars. Some megapolises like Moscow, Pekin or Mexico have strong fog which contains gases from cars and fabrics. It is not provoken by air travel. Moreover, air travel is essential for modern world. Laws, which some people want from government , will stop international tourism and international business. Thesis about unnecessary of air travel is false. Modern life cannot be without using planes. If government introduce laws to reduce amounnt of air travel, citizens will protest.
On the other side, some air companies use old types of planes and they can contribute greatly to air pollution. Air travel is quite expensive kind of transport and it can be replaced by cheaper transport like railways or long-vehicle cars. Government can introduce new taxes for using air transport. Money from this taxes can be used on the desense from air pollution and global warming.
To sum up, air travel has own problems and can cause it, but in general, modern world cannot reduce the amount of air travel and refuse to planes. It is big money and very significant role in life of every person on the planet. Air travel cannot be reduced.
