Nowadays we live in the overpopulated world. Each day personal and public transport are used, houses are built, useful objects are constructed on factories… Undoubtedly, all those actions result in various kinds of pollution. The most sevear kind of it is air pollution, because all humans need fresh air to breathe. Governments see the increased amount of air travel as the major reason for that, but is it really so? Should we really restrict the number of air flights, or it is just a common failue?
As far as I am concerned, planes are the best way to travel in our constantly moving society. First of all, most air carriers earn huge amounts of money annually, so they can afford to buy up-to-date planes with special filters and other features to prevent pollution. So, if we restrict the number of flights, companies’ revenues will reduce and they won’t simply have enough money for modern planes. What is more, with reducing the number of air flights, the frequency of using other types of transport will certainly rise dramaticaly, because people will still need to travel on work and for pleasure.
Nevertheless, smaller amounts of air transportation have it’s advantages. For instance, the amount of noise will be certainly reduced, there will be less fuel used. In addition, this may lead to a possibility of inventing a new eco-friendly, fast and convenient means of transport in future.
Taking everything into consideration, one may come to a conclussion, that the issue of the link between minimazing the level of air pollution and restricting air travel may arose mixed feelings, but as far as I see it, there is no direct correlation.
