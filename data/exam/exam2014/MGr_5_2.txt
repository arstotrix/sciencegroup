There is no doubt that almost all people living on the Earth are aim to be happy. But who can give the right definition to the word “happiness”?
In my point of view, nobody can suggest it for some reasons.
To beging with, this term “happiness” is difficult to define because people have different opinion about how to become happy. For example, some of us want to have a lot of money and power. However, others prefer think more about health of their relatives and friend. Thus, we all have differents priorities in our live, to my mind, it forms our percieve about happiness.
What about factors, which is important in becoming happy. As far as I am concerned, that people should follow the phrase: “Do what you like. Like what you do.” It means that we ought to chose our way in life taking into account our interestst because you cannot be happy if you do not like your job. Secondly, if you want achieve something you should do the best for it. To my mind, laziness kills happiness. Another factor is the support because people who have close friends with whom they can talk about problems, they are able to do everything. Friends give some advice and help when you need it. In my point of view, if a person have friends, he or she is lucky and happy.
To sum up, I strongly believe that people define the word “happiness” different, however, all of us should to feel support to achieve what we want in life and to become happy.
