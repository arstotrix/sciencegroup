These pie charts present data about the ages of the populations of Italy and Yemen in 2000 and predictions for 2050.
The first two charts illustrates changes in percentage of Yemen people in 15-59 years. In 2000 its percentage was close to the percentage of children from 0 to 14 years, and in 2050 it will rise to 57.3% while children will be 37% of Yemen population.
The situation in Italy is quite different. In 2000 there were 61.6% of 15-59 year-old people and only 24.1% of people who are older than 60 years. In 2050 the percentage of 60+ year-olds will rise to 42.3%, while percentages of other ages will go down. These changes in Italy are more significant than in Yemen.
The data that provided by the pie charts shows how rapidly the population in Yemen and Italy would become older and the percentage of children would reduce in 2050.
