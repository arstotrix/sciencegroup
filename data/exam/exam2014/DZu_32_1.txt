The table below represents the general information about railway systems in six cities. These table consists four blocks, which are: the name of the city, a date, when the underground railway was founded, the amount of the kilometer of route and the last but not the bast one is a quantity of people using the railway.
According to the table, the underground railway system, which is located in London, is both the longest and the oldest one. However, London mentro is famous for its age and sixe, while Tokyo is know as one of the most over crowded cities in the world. Obviously, that underground in that capitol is used by a lot of people: to be clear there are almost 2000 million people, who are moving though the city by metro, in a year. Furthermore, the Los Angelesâ€™s underground system is just starting its history: it was founded only in 2001 year. and it is not a huge one yet and little amount of people uses it (comparing to Paris, for example), what may be caused by its length.
Anyway, each underground railway system is special, just like the city it is located in.
