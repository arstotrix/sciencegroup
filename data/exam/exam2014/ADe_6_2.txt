It is common opinion, that the earlier you pick up foreign language, the better. For this purpose parents try to choose special schools for their children or even hire a personal tutor.
  I have a strong doubt, that it all can work efficiently, if a child doesn’t want to study foreign language. I can prove it with some arguments.
  First of all, learning foreign language consists not only from the class work. There are lots of things, students must do at home. But it is common when a child does not like a subject and quits doing homework, reading extra material, etc. In this case, if a child is completely against the subject, making him to learn it is just a violation. It’s better to wait until secondary school, and things will probably change.
  Then, no one can persuade a child to learn something by heart. And in learning any foreign language learning by heart is extremely important. But at primary school a child can be just unprepared to learn big amounts of material. He can just lack ability to do this because of his or her young age.
  And the final point is that in primary school a child has no idea of who he is going to be in future, exept dreams. So it is not known, whether he or she would need a foreign language or not. In secondary school student’s attitude towards himself is much more clear, he can start to think seriously about a sphere to work in.
  To sum it up, I can say that it is better to wait with making a decision when to start learning foreign language with your children. Otherwise you risk to spoil school years of your daughter or son.
