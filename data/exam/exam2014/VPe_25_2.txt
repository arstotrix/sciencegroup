Nowadays there is a problem of young people who decide to work or travel for a year between they high school have finished and are going to entire at university. Of course, there are some advantages and disadvantages for this action. 
Of course, it is a very good time for travelling, because at this age from 17 to 29 years old, young people at this age have no problem with free time, they do not think about it. They have no children, who need a lot of attention and much of time. This year could be exelent, because they can meet a lot of new interesting and nice people. They can visit a lot of countries and may be fall in love with somebody from another place. 
Unfortunately, despite that there some consequances. It could be just wasting of time. This year can be essential because if young people after finishing high school want to be encouraged to work or travel for a year befor university studies, it could be complicated to enteir at the university later. That can happen because they can forget some featurs that can be useful and important at the university and it could be hard to get it again. 
In conclusion, I would like to say that everyone has freedom of choice. Of course, it is really difficult to come back for studing, but this time of travelling must be like a miracle if you will not spend it with no aim. But, of course, there is another university studies, and it allows not to lose some knowladge or skills that you got in high school.
