The information provided illustrates the proportion of people aged 65 and over from 1940 to 2040 in Japan, Sweden and USA.
It can be deduced from the graph that the amount of old population in Japan is the biggest in 2040 year, demonstrating approximately 6-time growth from 1940 year. In contrast, proportion of population aged 65 and over in Sweden does not show such rising: the percentage of old people rises from 7% in 19040 to 25% in 2030, demonstrating only 3-time growth. Similarly, the proportion of amount of old population in USA demonstrates approximately 3-time growth from 9% in 1940 to 24% in 2040 year.
Overall, after analysing the graph given it can be said that percentage of population in Japan is the biggest at the end of the period provided, though USA and Sweden demonstrate the same rising of old population.
