Nowadays there are a lot of different subjects in universities that people are allowed to choose. Some of the subjects are more likely to be taken by male students, and others are interesting for female students. So, there is an inequality between the number of them.
On the one hand, universities can solve this problem by accepting equal numbers of male and female students in every subject. Firstly, there would be an opportunity for all students to study the subject as a person must be openminded and develop every side of his or her personality. Secondly, social life can be more interesting and different with a number of different kinds of students.
On the other hand, there can be a problem when some of students are not keen on this or that subject. They all have own hobbies and interests, so there would be more logical to allow students to visit lessons they are fond of. Moreover, uniwersity is the place where students prepare to be professionals, so it means that there must be a choice what subject to take, no matter equal numbers of male and female students are or not.
In conclusion, I want to say that it doesn't really matter how many male or female students learn every subject. They have to make their own right choices, in case to express themselves or their ideas, especially if they are sure about their future career. So, even if only girls or only boys learn the subject, they should be enjoying the lessons.
