Nowadays universities can accept male and female students in different specializes. The problem of sex is a controversial issue worth discussing. I am partly agree with the proposition of equal numbers of male and female students.
Many people argued that in the modern society it should not be any differences between men and women. Firstly, this hypothesis was accepted by constitution and that do it right. Secondly, many psycologists considered this question from different angles and they said that women could be more strong than men and they could be as active as men. Thirdly, if female students are interested in education the universities should not isolate them from the science because it could damage their health.
On the other hand, there are some points that could stop the female activity. For example, the biological differences between women and men are reasonable when it concerns harmfull work. In addition, the education takes a lot of times and women could not have some possibilities to do their personal work at home. Furthermore, the equal number of male and female students in the one subject could provoke different conflicts and it is not good.
To conclude, it can be noticed that the distance between women and men should not be as large as it was in the Middle Age. Personally, I believe that government should found a good resolutions because it is a very important question with positive and negative sides.
