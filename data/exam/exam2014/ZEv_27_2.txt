In our modern global world education plays an important role in socialization process as a key to a successful career. However, sometimes students in schools do not behave appropriately and that causes much problem. I’d like to talk about the reasons at this phenomena and suggest some possible solutions.

As fas as reasons are concerned, I do believe that such bad behaviour can appear only in a certain age, when student hasn’t entered university. It also may result from relationships with parents or from the poor quality of boring classes. To my opinion, if student is interested in what he is learning he will not attempt to interrupt teacher and so on. On the other hand, if student is not occupied and if lesson is boring, student will try to find some entertainment and may cause some obstacles during the educational process.

Concerning the solutions I do suppose that educational system actually already uses a lot of good methods. For example, I think that what we call “parents gathering” may be a good way to let parents know about their child’s behaviour and make them try to improve this situation. I would also suggest to let students choose educational courses in the beginning of such academic year. This, I believe, (would) allow to prevent a lot of cases of inappropriate behaviour, because students would become more involved in and encouraged by learning.

To put it all in a nutshell I would like to emphasize that the importance of education of any level can not be overestimated and we should try our best to improve it.
