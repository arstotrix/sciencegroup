Nowadays it has been considerable debate over the question about the sex. Some people think that quantity of male and female students should be equal, others prefer just male or female recruit of students. Personally I fundamentally agree with the first position for several reasons.
It is believed that the confluence of man and woman is an unique and perfect form. To begin with, it is clear that they should communicate with each other, because they may create new family in future. Thus, everyone from childhood should know which behaviour is appropriate between man and woman. Moreoverm equal numbers of male and female will be encouraged to harmony in study process, which will not allow to develop just male or female features with students.
There are a lot of other benefits for this idea. One needs to look  at historical esamples. It is known that unequal relation between man and woman has led to wars of genders. Everyone considered to defender its rights and minded any discrimination. Therefore it would be better to contribute to good relations between girls and boys starting from years of school and university.
In conclusion, it can be stated that the relation of male and female plays important part in our life. Whether to choose equal or unequal numbers of men and women is a matter of personal choice and preferences of university. I have been convinces that our goverment should organize the recruit of students with the same quantity as men as women. At present, it is the best way for building harmonical and ideal society.
