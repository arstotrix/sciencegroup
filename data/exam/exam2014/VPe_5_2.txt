Positive and negative aspects of a gap year.
A gap year is a year between graduating from school and going to university, which ise very popular among American students. However, in my country, Russia, it is considered to be just a waste of time. So is it worth taking a gap year before you continue your education.
First, letâ€™s look at advantages. To start with, it gives you time to think about what university or college you would like to go to. Secondly, for those who travel, it is a good opportunity to see the world and make friends with people from other countries. What is more, you can also get work experience during the year, try your hand at various occupations. And finally, it helps you just to relax and have a good rest before going on with your studies.
However, taking a gap year has also a few disadvantages. Firstly, you will have to spend more time on your education. As a result, you will be able to start working and making money a year later. Secondly, there is a great risk to waste your time instead of spending it usefully. This is especially true for lazy and unenthusiastic students. They might even break the law because of having nothing to do. They need to be controlled all the time.
To sum up, a gap year is a great opportunity for self- development if you use this time wisely.
