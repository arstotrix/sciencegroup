Nowadays there are a lot of universities which offer different subject in all spheres of life. Usually women prefer certain subjects as a men, that is why there are not equal number of men and women in each subject. However, same people think that the number of male and female students should be equal. In my opinion, men and women have the right to choose the subject what they want to study. 
On the one hand, in the Earth much more women than men. Due to this fact the number of female students is much more in any groups; if the subject of the interest is equal for each sex. For example, in schools the number of female students are doubled in comparative with male students.
On the other hand, there is the main difference why in Universities there is such a great unequally number of male and female students. This is a specialization of university and subject. For example, in technical universities accept more male student,  because female studens do not give the documents to university. Men are better in maths, physics or astronomy. It will be silly accept, for instance, 2 women and 2 men, if it would be better accept 4 male students with the highest score, than female students who have minimal results.
To sum up, the idea to accept equal number of men and women in Univerities are unreal, because the following system do not give an opportunity to go to university due to studenâ€™s sex.
