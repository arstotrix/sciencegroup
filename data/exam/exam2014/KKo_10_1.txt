The pie chart shows the number of people of different ages in two countries: Yemen and Italy for the year 2000 and for the year 2050.
Talking about Yemen, significant changes can be seen. The percentage of 15-59 years old men and women will grow up from 46.3% to 57.3% to the year 2050. But the percentage of people who are from 0 to 14 years old will went down from 50.1% to 37%.
The opposite situation is in Italy. The number of 15-59 years old population will fall from 61.6% to 46.2% during the 50 year period. Moreover, the number of 60+ years old people will significantly increase.
The overall trend in both countries is that in projections for 2050 year there will be less children. The big difference which can be seen is that in Yemen the number of children will prevail the number of children in Italy, where the biggest part of population is people from 15 to 59 years old and old people, who are more than 60.
