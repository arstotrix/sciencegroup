Much could be said about different ways to punish student because of their behaviour. People all over the world face this problem when teachers can not control their student and the point is to try explain why young people act like this and to try to find the possible and effective solution.

As for me, I could call the family as the main reason. If a child is not taught to act the right way he or she will not understand what the reasons of punishment or angry are. Also, problems with behaviour may be connected with teenagersâ€™ desire to go against the system, to stand their ground inspite any troubles, even if they are not right. This origins from the feeling that the way somebody treats them is unfair. Moreover, problems with student behaviour may be caused by taking care by their parents to much. In other words, since childhood little girl or boy always has everything he or she could ever wish, is never punished or never knows that there are some things which are not allowed to do. All of these factors way become crusial in future.

Nevertheless, as any other problems this one, in my opinion,has its solution too. One of the possible but not always effective way is to try to influence the parents of students which are trouble-maker. Also, it is worth talking to students trying to explain why and what for they should improve their behaviour. And, I think, the most important one is not to argue in order to warn a student that he or she is not right.

To sum up, I would like to say that even though the first and the main step of socialization process is a family, it does not mean that schools and universities can not try to communicate with students in order to solve problems with behaviour by comforting and supporting.
