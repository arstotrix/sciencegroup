There are two different points of view on a problem related improving human’s health by increasing the amount of sports centres. Some people believe that it is good idea, however, others disagree with that statement. People, who do not agree with these improvements explains that it is not enough do a lot of sports facilities, because people not interested in sports. Government should solve that problem in another way, for example, give motivation for doing sports. Children and adults coming home and turn on their TV, but they do not want to go to the sport centre and start training. They do not understand that keeping feet is very good example for spending their leisure time. I strongly believe that increasing of number of sport facilities will not solve problems with the people’s health. There is another point of view on a problem. People, who support this idea believe that with increasing amount of sports facilities will lead to improving human’s health. Also they explain that persons who in favour of sport and fan of spending time in sports centres will be an alive example for the fat people and who like spend time in front of TV on the sofa. Moreover, new sports equipment will attract human’s interest and they will want to try it by themself. In conclusion I would say that sport should be very important part in everybodie’s life, because sport is the same as health, they are synonyms. People who in favour of sport are always healthy and calm. But people who believe that spending time in front of the TV are strongly wrong. I belive that government should do more than increase the number of sports facilities.
