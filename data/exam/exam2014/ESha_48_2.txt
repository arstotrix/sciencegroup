Nowadays a great amount of people is becoming more and more concerned about their health. There are a lot of supporters of the idea that improving sport facilities can lead to an increasing level of general health of the population. Whereas others incline that such an improvement will not change anything and we need to think over other measures to solve the problem of low level of health.


From my point of view, developing sport facilities in the country undoubtedly can make things better. Firstly, sport activities stimulates blood circulation. So that people, who will use the opportunity to go in for sports will reduce the risk of heart deseases significantly.  What is more, physical activity can present body from fast ageing. That means that people can live longer and can be healthy, when they are already rather old. It can lead to the decline in the level of mortality in the country and as a result that will increase its well-being.


On the other hand, a great part of people think that there is no sense to invest money in sport and incline that there are more considerable problems, that need money to be developed. The point in favour of this position is that finding cure against serious deseases is much more important. Investing money in this sphere is a fight against the real problem, but not the attempt to prevent potential problems.


Furthermore, more effective measure to improve the health level of population can be vacination. Deseases canbe prevented in such way but people are sometimes not enough aware of benefits of vacination and ignore it. Sport can help in such causes, but medical measures can.


All things considered, it is only for government to decide what measures to introduce in order to rise the level of health, but in my opinion it will be better probably to co-operate both medicinal and sport improving measures.
