The line graph demonstrates the percentage of citizens of Japan, Sweden and USA which are aged  65. The main trend is that the number of people aged 65 and over increased from 1940 to 2040.
First of all, there were only 5% of population in Japan at the beginning of this period which were older than 65. Then we can see a slight decrease in their number from 1940 to 1960. The proportion of the citizens aged 65 and over was stable between 1960 and 1987. However, the percentage of Japanes aged 65 and over rose from 1987 untill reached the stage of near 7% at 2014. It is predicted that the proportion of old people in this country will rise in the nearest 26 years.
As for the number of the population aged 65 and over in Sweden and USA, there was a steadily rise with slight falling and some flactuations. So there will be almost 26% of citizens in Sweden older than 65 in 2040 while the proportion of Americans aged 65 and over will increase more than twice in comparison with their nimber in 1940.
