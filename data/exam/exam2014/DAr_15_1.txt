Four pie-charts below illustrate the population ages of Italy and Yemen in 2000 and projections for 2050. First of all we can see a big difference between young population of Italy and Yemen in 2000 and 2050. People of age from 0 to 14 are half the population of Yemen in 2000. In the future this percent will be reduced to 37. To compare, in Italy the percent of yong people is much less than in Yemen. It is 14,3 per cent of the whole population in 2000 and 11,5 percent in 2050. People of age 60 and more takes 3,6 per cent of population in Yemen and 24,1 percent in Italy. In 2050 the situation in Yemen will not be changed significantly, but in Italy it will be almost doubled. People of age from 15 to 59 takes two thirds of population of Yemen. In 2050 this part of population will reach 57 per cent in Yemen and 46,2 percent in Italy. Finally, we can say that Yemen and Italy have different proportions of population and the same situation will be in 2050.
