For many centuries art was an important part of our life. Nowadays it is also not the exclusion: every day we admire it in different forms: we listen to music, watch films or even watch some advertisings. To this point it is believed that for persons, who made these things, artists, freedom is needed to express their creation. However, some people believe that government restrictions plays crucial role and can improve our life. In all areas of art freedom to express own ideas is needed. For example, we can consider music spere. All composers or music players make some awesome works. There they usually express their own feelings, own attitude by composing these songs or works. If they are restricted by government, they won't be able to make these marvellous creations truly from their heart. It is like to be a wild animal behind the bars, in the cage near to their natural home. However, it is also believed that it is a big mistake to give freedom to artists to express their own thoughts. Many of these ideas can be really harmful for government. For instance, one statement can lead to a disagreement between different peoples which can cause a conflict and in bad case will lead to a revolution. In 20th centure Soviet Union have the policy to restrict the artists: the ones, who allow themselves to make some contraversial works were prisoned in order to make the nation more "clean". Without creation our life will be dark and not interesting. Artists help us to admire the beauty not only of the art, but of the whole world. As for me, I think that it is crucial to give freedom for artists to express their thoughts. Only in this case we can fully understand all circumstances and conditions of the problem. And of the art, of course.
