The graph, which is offered to me, vividly represents the quantitative alterations concerning the high-aged social group (65 years old) during the period of 100 years (since 1940 to 2040) in Japan, Sweden and the USA.
It could be deduced, that the so-called “Country of the Rising Sun” experiences the most sharp changes –both past and future ones. For instance, the outline starts at the comparatively low index (only 5% in 1940), than reaches the bottom mark in 1960 and remains stable over the next 30 years. However, it is probable that in the third millenium Japan would became an ultimate leader of the named comparisson.
The vectors of Sweden and the Unated States have generally corellating courses: both of them begin under the rate of 10%, gradually increase and possess their evident future marks around the bar of 25%. Still, an outsanding period should be mentioned: the 2010’s are remarkable for the rushing increase of the “Swedish-vector”, while the graph of America stays in its “platau-phase”.
Overall, the aging-statistics of the three described countries are clearly illustrated by the graph.
