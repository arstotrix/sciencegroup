Some people argue that creative artists are given too much freedom nowadays, while others think that self-expression can't be limited with any kinds of rules. I suppose that artists should be able to create whatever they want. Nevertheless there have to be some restrictions related to showing it publicly.
First of all, some artists don't have any boundaries and a lot of people love their works. However, these pieces of art can be harmful for children, because they are very sensitive and they percept everything they see. That's why it's reasonable to prohibit children to watch some films, visit some exhibitions and listen to some pieces of music.
Secondly, I have mentioned earlier that these restrictions should not be too serious. It means that artists should have their right to create anything they want. If a child gets access to prohibited pieces of art it's not the fault of an artist.
Also I believe that the grown-ups are able to decide themselves whether to read a book or not, whether to go to an exhibition or not. Even if they are shocked by the way an artist expresses himself they can deal with it. That's why the adults shouldn't not be restricted from getting acquomted with this or that piece of art. The only limit has to be the dignity of other people. I think that it concerns some kinds of installations.
All in all, it seems to me that people are free to express themselves. On the other hand, they need to remember that they are not the only ones who will see their creations. The restrictions are to focus on protection of children and dignity of other people and not on some political matters. These restrictions should not be similar to censorship.
