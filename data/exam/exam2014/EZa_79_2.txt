There should be no government restrictions on ideas of creative artists. They should always have freedom of expression.
As for me, there are only few sections in society that should be under government restrictions. For example government’s regulation is needed for economic or science. Without regulation and restrictions that it mades some spheres of human’s life could not exist. Speaking about art we should understand that its development clearly depends on new ideas that could be revolutionary or misunderstandable by the government, so some restrictions could provide gradually fall in art achievement of any countries’ artists. For art-workers restrictions on what they do is restrictions on their freedom. It is more than necessary restrictions. When murders are not allowed by government it is necessary, because of danger for citizens. But when some literature, paint or other art are not allowed it is another situation. Art could not make danger itself and those restrictions are aimed on creating of ideological pressure that would help government to reach its own goals by restriction on human’s freedom.
To sum up, I think that the idea of restriction on artists’ ideas could not exist at all, because it breaks human’s rights. Only the damaging art such as terroristic could be restricted by government. The USSR is a great example of those restrictions for artists.
