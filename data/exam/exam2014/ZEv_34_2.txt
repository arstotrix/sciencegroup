In many countries, in the big number of schools teachers suffer from bad behaviour of some students. There are hooligans who break the glass of windows in classes, who talk to teachers rudely, and using sometimes dirty, inappropriate words, who kick their classmates. Parents and teachers ask physchologists for help hoping that these specialists will give answer – why do some students behave not so great?

A variety of different researches had given some results, and now specialists explain the reasons of bad behaviour in next ways (which, I agree with): for example, they say, hooligans are victims of their personal problems – being heartbroken, experiencing the parents’ divorce. Physchologists note that young girls and boys (especially, teenagers) go through such problems with difficulties – they give full or anger, hatred, sorrow and etc. speaking about example for this, we can remember the frontman of rock-group “Nirvana” who became angry at the people around, cynic after his mother and father had broken up.

Another reason which is noted by specialists is a wish to seem better, stronger for somebody (boys fight, girls look at the winner). If you want an example, we can remember the film “Back to Future” – Marty Mcfly’s father was threeted by his classmate, Biff Tannen, who wanted to be the strangest boy for girls around him and his company.

How to solve this problem? In my opinion, mothers and fathers should speak with their children and try to help them instead of ignoring. They are ought to anticipate the risk of turning into hooligan and don't let kids solve any difficulties with fists, kicks, weapons, murders. And for kids… They must believe to their nearest and dearest.
