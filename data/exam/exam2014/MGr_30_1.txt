The first bar chart shows two reasons which students choose to continue the study and their interests depend on age groups. This chart shows that 80 percent of student under 26 years old tend to study for career and only 10 precent for interest. During the time students change their reasons and chart shows us that elder students tend to work for interest.
The second  bar chart shows employer support for student with different reasons for study by age group. The most successful students supported by employer are people under 26 years old, and the least are student from 30 to 39 years old.
Reffering to summirise information about two charts, employers support young people who aims to make a career and  be successful in their work. Moreover students from 30 to 39 are least supported by employers. Perhaps in this age students should have some work experience and tend to continue do their career and it is harder to help these people to start for employer.
