It is a well-know fact that sports is one of the most efficient ways to keep fit and healthy. Therefore a lot of people consider that there should be increased the amount of sports facilities, while the other claim it would be inappropriate. As far as I am concerned, I believe public health should be improved with the help of other measures.


Firstly, the process of improvement of public health requires modern  infrastructure that provides hospitals and other related services. Undoubtelly, only professional doctors are able to ensure our health. Secondly, public health is dependant on the food that we eat, that is why the government should care about its quality using certain measures.


However, people that follow the alternative point of view, are convinced that the best way to make people stay healthy is to provide more and more sports facilities. Furthermore, they suppose that organising special contests and events like the Olympiads would help a lot to improve public health because a lot of sports centers are built for such kinds of events.


To sum up, due to the fact that there exist two absolutely different points of view, it remains a contentions issue. However, the opinion that states sports facilities is the most effective way to improve public health can be easily refuted: if people do not have a will to stay healthy, sports facilities will not help. At the same time my arguments appear to be quite logical, unbiased and fair.
