Nowadays there is a great number of universities and faculties, teenagers could choose to enter. Each university has it’s own way to invite puples for further education, giving the possiblity to attend different classes, but if it shoulf let to study subjects to equal numbers of male and female? I don’t think so, to speak frankly. 
First of all, some subject some subjects are not popular for males or females. I mean spheres are so different now to be studied by all of people. As a rule, driver is likely to be a male profession, but a teacher is usualy a female ; that is why it would be hard to attend such classes without interest, it wouldn’t be popular just because of sex. What is more, it is not nesessary to my mind, I believe males would be more succesful doing “male work”, but not attending classes to study the way to do “female work”; that society make you obey.
One more option is the way people think: men and women have different logic and method to overcome problems and to do work well. Females are always too emotional, that is why subjects concerning stress is not for them.
What is more, to enter the university person have to pass special exams, and those who has a greater point is to be given a chance to study in university. Obviously, it is impossible to have the same results between males and females to have equal entering chance, that is why groups form without paying attention on sex (just exams results).
To sum up, I believe it is not necessary to accept equal numbers of male and female because of many reasons.
