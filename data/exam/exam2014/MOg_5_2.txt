The scolars claim that the characteristics we get from birth have much more impact on our personality and development than life experiences we may achieve.
On the one hand, the nature gives us the body with its own particularities. Someone is a healthy man, someone is born with illness. Moreover, it is believed that people’s brain opportunities are different, for instanse, some people have no problem with Maths, other people have to make an effort to solute a mathimatical task.
On the other hand, our experience we may get during our life much more influence on our personality. Firstly, society where man is situated influence his personality. His family and friend have a huge impact on man’s character and his behaviour. Secondly, man can change his characteristics getting education. Sometimes one book may change reader’s mind and make him overview a life situation.
To develop this issue better, John Lock had a theory that a man looks like white paper and the life experiences write on this paper. However, John Lock disagreed with his idea latter because his research shows an another outcome. If all people were similar from the birth, they would have a similar success in their development. However, we do not see this result in our life.
In conclusion, the characteristics we are born with have a significant influence on our personality and development. Nevertheless, we cannot refuse the majority of life experiece. During whole life we can change our personal features under the social circumstance or we can get essential for change knowledge. Thus, it is difficult to say what has much more influence on us.
