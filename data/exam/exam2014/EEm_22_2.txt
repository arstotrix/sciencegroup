There are different views whether it should be a balance of male and female students in every subject or not. I completely disagree with the idea that universities should accept equal numbers of men and women.

The main argument of opponents would be that balanced proportion of males and females in subject lets create balanced society with differentiation of labour. However, I believe that natural proportions could help to see tends in studentsâ€™ choices. Moreover, they would be able to realize in a sphere they want. So students can spend their time doing things they are good at. Thus, we will get escelent specialists at different sites of our life.
