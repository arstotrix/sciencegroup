The chart shows information about people's qualification in Australia and diving of males and females who held them in 1999. 
It seems from the chart that most part of men had skilled vocational diploma. But only one part of men had undergraduate diploma in comparance to women, because two part of three of who held this diploma were female. Nearly half of bachelor's degree keepers  were males. Oppositing to undergraduate diploma, the number of male postgraduate diploma keepers was twicely mote than female postgraduates. And number of men who had master's degree were on a half more than number of women. 
This information means that there was big gender  proportions difference between different degrees keepers. Most of master's degree, postgraduate diploma and mainly skilled vocational diploma keepers were men. And men are generally more educated, because there are more male than female in most of educational degree held in 1999 in Australia.
