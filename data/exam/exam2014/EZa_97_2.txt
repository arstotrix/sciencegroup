Throught hundreds of years there have always been arguments about the degree of freedom artists should be given. And this problem is still  very actual nowadays.
On the one hand, the freedom of action gives an artist an opportunity to express his own feelings and fully reveal himself. But at the same time some of there throughts and ideas can be unaacceptable in there society and some of there works way irritate and even hurt feelngs of other people. and the only way to solve this problem is to restrict the artists actions in there works by the government to introduce censorship.
But in this case the problem is that such arrangements break the freedom of will and action which is so actively propogandized in the modern world. And most of democratic countries can not allow themselves to make such cardinal steps as it may cause even more disturbance from there population.
Talking all this into cansideration, I must say that my oppinion is that, despite the fact that it may offend the artists and some of other people, there should be some government restrictions in artists actions as some things should not be shown on publics.
