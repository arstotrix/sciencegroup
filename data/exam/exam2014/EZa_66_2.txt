Nowadays a lot of talented people are restricted by the government. More creative artists are appearing in the community and as far as I know the only one problem in modern society is censure. 
In my opinion, it is right that, government is controling this part of the cultural world, because some of newcomers in art are trying to use inappropriate content for their work such as enormous nudity, unmannered words and phrases or even scenes of violence. I suppose tgat there must be some age sectors for artists like children picture artist, 12+ age artist, 18+ age artist and so on. However, there must remain forbidden themes or genres: for example a child pornography or an over-caution violence. 
Although, in our technical era art isn't existing like it was century and further ago, today a lot of artists are trying to create art on their own personal computers or laptops using wide variety of drawing tablets or even simple mouses. And of course government can't restrict everyone, because of internet and its laws. In internet yoiu are able to do whatever you want without a risk of being caught or even a risk of being recognised. In this case it is impossible to trace every art work appearing in network. 
In conclusion I would like to say that in 21st century art become more aviable for artists as well as for everyone else, who would enjoy arts. And for every talented artist there's two ways: to work according to rules and censure restrictions and if your art is good enough you have chance to become famous or yoiu can go another way and become an anonymous artist and never reach success.
