Nowadays, a lot of people want be health. Therefore there are many view to improve public health. Some people think that increasing the number of sports facilities can help to improve public health. I agree with this way, because sport is an important part in the health. Sports can help be energy and happy. To my mind, the mein part of health is health-food, for example, vegetables, nuts and fruits. Every people should not eat fust-food and prefer vegetables, because there are a good elements for health in there. Also, I think, that governments should produce TV program about health, for instance, “How to be health” or “Yoja”. So, people could do exercise in home near TV. For example, in my country there is a good TV program “Jivi”. This channel shows how to do some exercise in sports and also talk about health-food. It help my famaly be okey. In the end I want to edd that there are of the best ways to improve public health. So, this problem is very important nowadays and not only people, but and goverments have to build more hospitals in countries, to help will health and energy.
