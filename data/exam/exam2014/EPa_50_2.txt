Sport has always been an essential part of our lives throughout the history. It is not surprising that, many and many people have started to go to different sport clubs in order to keep fit. In view of this, there are many disputes concerning the improving of public health. Many people claim that it is nessecary to increase the number of sports facilities and different sport clubs. However, their opponents believe that it would not have big effect on public health. What is more, they support the idea that other measures are need. Who is right? The way I see it, I do not agree with opponents` point of view. To begin with, nowadays, it is not a secret that there are lots of sports facilities and variety of gyms. Every one who want to keep fit can choose any varient of sport clubs and go to there. However, a large amount of sports facilities does not matter that it would influance largely on public health. For instance, if people want to look well and keep fit, they should not limit themselves by only going for the gym. Moreover, you can go to there every day, but it would not lead to satisfies results, whereas people who mix the sport and resort may have the best ones. 
On the other hand, sport is a way to express your feels and look very well. Firstly, sport is indeed popular in many countries, especially in USA, consequently, there is a demand on it. Thus, the increasing of number of sports facilities will improve public health. Secondly, every one wants go to the gym, which is near by his house; so, increasing the number of sport clubs would be a good way. Thirdly, people want to corect not only their stomack, but also lags, hands, etc; thus, it would be great to have a big number of sports facilies, too. 
To sum up, there are different opinions about improving public health. The way I see it, we can do it if we will have a large.
