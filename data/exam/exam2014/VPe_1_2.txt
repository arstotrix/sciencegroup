Studying at the University is always demanding process. Sometimes it is better to take a break after school and have a rest for a year. But the results of this decision are not so evident.
On the one hand, having a gap year could be really helpful for some reasons. For example when people were stressed all the time during their school education they can benefit from such a gap year, to improve their physycal and menthal health. Moreover, seeing some new places of interest could give people the opportunities for cultural self-development and help to wide the range of their interests. All these features can be really useful in University studying process.
At the same time, some people can say that this year can be really harmful for studying process. First of all, such a gap year can destroy the working tempo which was taken during the school time. People can even forget all the material which they have learned. Furthermore, travelling abroad for a year can be really expensive and demand some extra features. If person decide to have a work this period it is important to remember that it could be hardly well-payed. Moreover, this work experience can produce some extra stress which can influence on future education process. 
In spite of all these disadvantages I still strongly convinced that people should have this opportunity to travel or to take a job for a year. It could give them unforgettable experience and encourage them to work harder successfully at the University.
