Nowadays there is a great concern about the health of people due to the way of life, slow physical activity. Therefore, some people state that a rise in the figure of sports equipment will definitely lead to resolution of the aforementioned problem.
Personally, I agree with this opinion.
To begin with, some people do not consider the growth of sports facilities value to be a solution of the problem. They suppose that innovations in medical sphere would give much more benefits. However, medical improvement will not be as productive as improvement in sports, since the cost are too large.
Moreover, boom in the number of sports equipment will lead to increase of physical activity attractiveness because a great deal of people want to take up playing some sports game but they just  do not have a possibility to do it. In addition, doing sports with friends will promote social relationship and vice versa, since doing sport together is a great pleasure. What is more, large amount of people will be motivated by the possibility of improving their own body, making it more attractive and stronger. The aspect of sport culture also must be taken in to consideration because it contains such notions as refusing from junk food, giving up smoking and others. This way of thinking will obviously have a positive effect on health of every person.
To conclude, rise in the amount of sport equipment will certainly cause improvement of health. This innovation will be beneficial for our society.
