It is known that happiness is integral in our life. People all over the world may have positive or negative experience. They might go through big troubles. That is why each person wants to achieve moral satisfactrion.
It is necessary to start with the reason of difficulties with giving a definition to the term “happiness”. Thus, everyone understands it in relation with personal aims and priorities. This means that if the man dreams of being wealthy his happiness is lots of money. By contrast, in case someone loves his family his happiness is healthy children. Moreover, people tend to categorise this term as a long or short process.
Consequantly, there is a need to think about possible factors which influence on happiness. First of all, a social states is very important for most of people. Therefore, if the man is repectable by the close circle of communication he feels happy. Secondly, a family and friends who support the person can help him to be absolutely satisfied. Finally, such factors as weather and mood sometimes stimulate smiles or tears. For example, according to researchers people in moderate climate conditions tell more frequently about themselves as happy.
To sum up, in my personal opinion, happiness is a short moment when there is an awarness that thothing can be better. Besides, the life is too short, so the person should try not to lose time.
