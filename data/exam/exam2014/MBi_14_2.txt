Nowadays a disproportion of male and female students studing in universtities can be noticed, particularly in some subjects. It is argued that universities should control this situation. Whether the universities should accept equal numbers of boys and girls in every subject is a question worth discussing.
First of all, it is undisputed that some professions and subjects are more likely to be chosen by male students and the others â€“ by female students. Which subject to study is a personal choice of everyone and this is his personal right, so universities should not deprive the students of it. Furhermore, this choice is not made by chance: it is known that men are usually more talented in technic subjects and women are more often skilled in humanian studies. It would be not reasonable to forbid someone to study a subject in which he or she is talented the most.
Besides, the sutiation in which, for example, the most part of audience is male of female contributes sometimes to a better studing. For example, in the past there were special schools for girls. It was done not only because the list of subjects for boys and girls was different, but also because boys separated from girls and other way around behaved much better and listened the teacher more carefully. Speaking about university, it can be said that the situation of equal numbers of boys and girls may also lead to relations between them, which may disturb the process of studing.
In conclusion, I totally disagree with the opinion provided and I would like the universities to accept the students regardless of their gender.
