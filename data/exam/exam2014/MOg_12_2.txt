There are two alternative opinions about inborn characteristics and life experience of human. It is argued which of the characteristics have the major influence.
On the one hand, it is believed that the characteristics we are born with have the major influence on our future lives. It can be proved by the scientists who study the genom. It is obvious that children get their characteristics from their mothers and fathers. In addition to this, there are people, who believe that the day and time of baby’s birth also has great influence on his or hers future life. There is no scientific proof that astrological characteristics are absolutely true but there are a lot of people who strongly believe in it’s importance.
On the other hand, some people think that life experience influences more on our personality. Firstly, it is clear that while children are treated in different conditions, they have absolutely different behaviour. There was a research, in wich twins were kept to different families and as the result they have growed up with absolutely different personalities. Moreover, it is proved that children, whose childhood was quite difficult, cope with problems in their adulthood much easier than those who had no difficulties in their childhoods. And last point but not least is that there are a lot of examples in psychology why people absolutely changed their behaviour whyle they were put into different social and living conditions.
In my opinion, life experience has the major influence on people’s personalities. Of course, genes play also a big role but the conditions in which a person lives make this person’s personality.
