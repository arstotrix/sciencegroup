This diagram shows us the a comparison in proportion of population aged 65 and over in three countries which are Japan, Sweden ane the USA. Obviously, we might point out that proportions all over the countries flactuate during 100 years (from 1940 to 2040). The tendencies of Japan and Sweden are partly similar while the tendency of the USA is considerably differ from them. We notice that there is a gradual growth in persantage of people elder 65 in Japan and Sweden while the USA tendency is quite stable from the year 1940 to 2020 and there is a huge bust in the year 2030 when the proportion reaches the point of 25% after 10% which was in the previous year.
The most attrective predictance is seen in the USA future, because their proportion is the biggest and it reaches a pick in the 2040 at the point of 27 persents. At the same time the maximum of Sweden's proportion is 25,5 persents and Japan's maximum is 23,5 persents.
