Many people in foreign countries prefer to have a gap year before entering university, which has its benefits and drawbacks. Obviously, studying process is very hard and very long, so as people might well tire of learning something every day. However, it is considered by some people that having a gap year is a waste of time.
Firstly, waiting a year before entering university ma give you so much new emotions, as you are able to visit foreign countries, experise new activities, meat interesting people and make friends with them. Moreover, while this free year somebody can settle down: marry, have children.
What is more, the gap year provide people with time, which could be spent on gaining knowledge, skills they will need in the university. For example, when a person whant to be a programmer, he should be developed in terms of Maths, Phisics, should know at least one of the languages. Unfortunately, school does not give opportunities for gaining these skills. Therefore, a person needs time to improve his level.
However, there could be some problems with a gap year. For instance, a financial problem, which might well prevent a person from spending a gap year beneficially, as special courses and travelling, cost a lot of money.
Also, there might well be a problem with changing interests and requests during the year without studying, For example, being upset with his faults, when a subject is too difficult, a person can change his mind about becoming a programmer. 
Summing up, a gap year is worth trying, although there are some drawbacks. However, I consider them to be not so important, as if you want to benefit from a gap year, you will do it without any money and you will cope with other problems.
