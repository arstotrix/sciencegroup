Some part of people think that unpaid community service need to be made as a course in high school. It could be helping homeless people or cleaning polluted environment.
For the one hand it’s a great idea to help teenagers to understand importance of free services. They will not waste their time for bad things, for example smoking. It will be a very big source for help to government. Teenagers will teach other people and study how to care about others, how to help to environment.
But in the other hand, everyone have a right on a decision. Pupils of high school are experienced enough to know do they want to offer a free help or they don’t.
I think that unpaid community service shouldn’t be a necessary part for every student, they need to have a choise.
