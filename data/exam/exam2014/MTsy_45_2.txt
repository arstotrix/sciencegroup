It is undeniable that health has always been playing indispensable role in any society. Sport is considered to be one of the efficient methods in improving individuals health. However there is also a claim that effects on health caused by sport activities are not as virtuous as it seems.
On the one hand, raising the number of sports facilities in the cities may provoke an increase in number of individuals doing in for sports. Sport activities can help people to ease stress tension and to be full of beans. More than that, children are more likely to take up an active life-style while spending time with their main role models - parents in available sport facilities. Due to this step, a dicrease in a number of overweighted people will be surely evidenced and and plenty of diseases caused by exceeded fat will almost disappear.
On the other hand, even if and individual is envolved in sport activities it's not garanteed that he or she will not face health problems caused by ecological problems, accidents, living conditions and so on. Therefore it is necessary to empasize on the improvement and availability of medical services. More than that, it is significant for governments and manufacturers to consider and solve ecological problems that are the top reason for incurable diseases.
In the end of the day, I would like to claim that health problems are more sophisticated and complex as it might seem and they can not be solved only by means of sport. That is why I am totally convinced that a special system of steps should be designed, aimed at improving cinditions in all aforementioned areas.
