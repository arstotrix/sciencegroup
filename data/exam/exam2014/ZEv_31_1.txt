The two graphs provided with the task display the tendency  of visit to and from the United Kingdom and show where UK residents went most in 1999.

The first charts clearly shows that there are more visits abroad by the UK residents than visits to the UK by overseas residents. In 1979 the difference was comparedly small â€“ 14 millions  versus 10 millions, but over the 20 years the difference became drastical. In 1999 over 50 million people went abroad, while only a little less than 30 million foreigners visited Great Britain.

The next chart displays where exactly those 50 million went. The least visited country is Turkey which was visited by 2 million British residents and two most visited places are Spain (9 million) and France (11 million). Also, some people went to Greece or the USA.

To sum up, over 20 years from 1979 to 1999 British began to travel more, especially in the near countries such as France or Spain, but some far-located resorts are popular as well.
