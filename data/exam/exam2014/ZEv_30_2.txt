Some people think that in many countries schools have severe problems with student behaviour. Let’s consider about it.

Of course it is one of the main problem in our modern society. It is very pity but some teenagers in their age of adults can be nerveous, angry, cruel and so on. And they try to appeal attantion to them and show their closer people they are cool and mature. But it is not true in fact. 

In my view parents must to teach their children to be kind and be polite with them, to help someone and of course parents and relatives must to give a good behavior to their children.

The different important problem which is connected with student's behaviour is disrespect to teachers in schools and universitys. In particular the examples of such behavior among the yogurt is in schools in USA, Germany, Canada and so on. 

I’am absolutely believe that these countrys have very democratic rules and behaviour in schools. Students there are free. They can do during the classes all what they want. The could laughing, eating, jumping (if it is hard to sitting on chair for them) and different.

And of course all aspects of such behavior are absolutely normally for their surrounding. These children don’t know different.

In conclusion I would like to said that the govornment could try to teach modern teenagers a good behavior. They could create some kind where yought could meeting and learn some new rules, feel some polite relation on them.
