The bar chart indicates the amount of males and females involved in studying certain types of higher education programmes in 1999 in Australia.


According to the chart, there is a significant gender difference in every area except bachelor's degree. For example, only about 10% of women decided to take skilled vocational diploma, while more than 80% of men did so. Another areas with the higher percentage of males are postgraduate diploma and master's degree, 70% and 60% respectively. Nevertheless, women were more appealed to have undergraduate diploma, as the number of them made up 70%. In comparison, the amount of men was only half of that.


To summarize, it is obvious that men were more involved in higher education than women. Although there were some types of degrees that interested females more, the overall trend is reverse. We can see clearly that the amount of males in almost any other area was double as the females' one.
