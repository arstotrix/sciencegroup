Nowadays a lot of studies are held to find out whether the characteristics we are born with have the major influence on out future life and personality on the whole or not. This is a matter of debate with several strong points both for and against. However, in my opinion, people can not deny that those characteristics have much more influence of their lives than any future life experiences.
Firstly, it is important to take into consideration both aspects: physical and mental. Speaking of physical characteristics we are born with, those can be changed during life, while it is much more difficult to change mental characteristics. Of course you can try to change something in yourself, make yourself better, nevertheless it is extremely rare for a person to change entirly. There are some exceptions talking about extrodinary life experiences, heavy emotional dramas, mental illnesses, but those took place very rare in peopleâ€™s life.
Another fact I would like to draw attention to is that we often are guided by the characteristics we are born with while going through any experience, even if we do not notice this. (As a fact, people can change a bit when going through adolesense, but after that if we do not feel the desire to change we usually do not.) Thus the characteristics we are born with influence even our life experiences sometimes.
To sum up, I suppose that the characteristics we are born with have a great influence on us and our lives. However, there are some exceptions when other factors become more important.
