Health is an inherent part of our lives. Nowadays there is a big challenge of keeping and improving it. People try to improve their health by doing sports. On the other hand an increase of sports facilities does not have enough influence on the level of public health.
It is generally accepted, that sport is an foundation of health. It is no coincidence. Sport activities have a positive effect on our physical state, cardio-vascular systeme and so on. Undoubtedly, a rise of sport facilities such as sport centers, stades o sport schools will lead to health improvements of people using them. In addition, providing possibilities of doing sports will attract teens. It may have a favorable impact on public health because it`s firstly teens, who damage it, by smoking or drinking alcohools for instance.
In opposite, increasing of the amount of sport facilities may have a little influence on health of population. At first, a lot of people have illnesses wich may not be changed by sports. Moreover in our world the majority of people are so lazy to do some activities, they are not willing to improve their health. 
As for me, increasing the amount of sports facilities may be just one of tools of improving public health. Apart from possibilities of doing sports it would be a good measure to provide a high-quality medical support and do it free of charge. Also, an access to things damaging our health such as cigarets as alcohool shoul be limited. 
To sum up, health is the most important thing we have in our lives. It should be improved not only by providing possibilities of doing sports, but also by a set of other measures.
