The charts provide information concerning the number of people who took travel to the UK and about UK residents who travelled abroad, as well as about the most visited countries.

In general we can notice that the number of both visits by residents travelling abroad and overseas residents travelling to the UK was gradually increasing during the period from 1979 to 1999. We also can see that five popular were: France, Spain, USA, Greece and Turkey.

Looking more closely at the first graph we can notice that visits by UK residents and overseas residents accounted for approximately 10 million in 1979. However, the number of visits by UK residents was increasing more rapidly, reaching about 53 million in 1999, while there were only about 25 million visits by overseas residents.

Secondly, (judying?) by the second graph we can understand that the most popular country visited by UK residents was France (more than 10 million in 1999).

All in all, it can be said that visits abroad and visits by foreigners have risen in numbers and the most popular country for UK residents was France.
