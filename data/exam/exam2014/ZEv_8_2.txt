Many countries all over the world face the problems connected with student’s behaviour at schools. There are some causes which leaf to this situation.

The first cause is that the most students do not see the practical realisation of the knowledge they study at school. Moreover the lectures have become really boring in most cases. All these causes lead to the fact that students mostly don’t  what to study at all, and this fact is always followed by the bad behaviour of students. This bad behavior act like a kind of the rebeling against the teacher or lector, who cannot involve the group of attenders into the subject. Another words teachers and lectures have lost their authorities for the most of students.

However, inspite of the fact that this problem is really difficult to solve, there can be some ways of getting over this issue. First of all teachers should always try to variate the ways they explain something. For example instead of simple using the desk, they can perform a presentation or show a film if we are talking for instance about history. Another way is to give an individual tasks according to the interests and hobbies of each student. It will be the great combination of favourite activity and nessesary task. Also teacher can use nontraditional way of teaching like a changing the place of performing classes. This can help teacher to gain the authority amont the students and make them to behave better, because they will be involved into the interesting process.

Overall, there can be many situation of this problem, but the most problem is that most of the teachers do not really desire to change anything in their methods of teaching. Teachers should begin with themselves to solve the problems of bad behaviour among the students. In case they desire to do this the best way is to involve students into a process and gain the authority, they have lost because of boring studies.
