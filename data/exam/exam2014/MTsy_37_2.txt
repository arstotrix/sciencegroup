There is an opinion, according to which the growth of sport activities is the main possibility to increase the level of public health. Although, this way has a range of disadvantages, I am strongly convinced in positive impact of it.
Nowadays a lot of negative factors for our health are existed. It is connected not only with enviroment pollution, but with bad habits and incorrect life style. Smoking and drinking alchohol drinks are popular yet. Work often becomes a cause of stress. People spend a lot of time sitting in offices and at home, because they have not free time for laisure.
There is a nive expression: "Sport is movement". Movement is one of the main things, which often lack in our life. Sport provides it. As a result, due to doing some sport activities, our health will improve. Take, for instance, morning jag or visiting fitness clubs. Legs, muscles, all our body becomes stronger. We feel tideness less.
However, in some cases sport can have bad influence on public health. Sportsmen and other people, who devotes their life for sport, often obtaines a dangerous traumas. We can even see that they detroyes their health and becomes disabled.
Nonetheless, in site of some damage to health because of sport, this way is really improve public health. People should not to do extreme activities and must be careful within doing sport. A lot of sport games can provide the strong health for people. i can give an example from my own life. My cousin suffered from different deciases in his childhood. So that his parents enroll him to the voleyball seccion. As a result, he so strong and never ill now. If parents continue to give some medical treatment, he would stay weakness. Therefore, sport is really the best way to improve health.
In conclusion I would like to emphises that people should find time for going in for sport. Because they can relax after work and obtaine a lot of benefits for their health.
