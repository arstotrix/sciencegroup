The charts given represent data about the ages of the citizens of Yemen and Italy in 2000, including predictions regarding the ages for 2050. It can be clearly seen that the majority of people, living in Yemen, were teenagers. In sharp contrast, just over 14 percent of Italians corresponded to this age category. Nevertheless, according to projections, the amount of Yemen citizens, who are children and teenagers, will decrease by approximately 13 percent, while the share of Italian young people will reduce insignificantly. What is more important, the middle aged population of Yemen and Italy took a large part of all citizens in both countries. However, it was predicted that most of people, living in Yemen, will be in this age group by 2050 in comparison with Italian population, whose age will be shared almost equally between middle-aged people and more older. It is also necessary to notice, that amount of retired people in Yemen took a very small part of population in 2000 and, according to predictions, this situation will follow a similar pattern in 2050. What about Italians, the percentage of their older people reached just under one fourth of population and this fraction will be even greater by 2050. 
Summarising preceding arguments, the population of Yemen will be mostly middle-aged by 2050, while the part of older people will remain stable at just under 6 percent rate. At the same time, Italian`s age will be shared between 15 - 60+ years equally and a small part of population will be teenagers.
