It cannot be denied that happiness plays one of the most important roles in people’s lifes, but there is big amount of ways to become happy. Unfortunately, only few people fell themselves really happy. It is important to understand how to become happy.
It is considered that the happiest people are those, who have hobby. It is important to have a place, where you can enjoy free time, doing something that you are interested in. Moreover, people, who share your interests can make you feel happier. Of course, spending time with relatives and friends can also influence on person’s mood.
Moreover, some people are quick to point out that happiness depends not only hobbies and free time. People should  mind on what they are doing at work, in school or university. Large amount of stress can mamke a person angry sad. Such fillings does not make somebody happy at all.
Unfortunately, people spend too much time on thinking on unimportant problems, they do not notice that they can be happy right now. From my point of view, such people dream too much. They wait for ideal amount and do not notice that things, that could make them happy are all around: friends, family, pets, sunny day, interesting book, and many others.
In conclusion, I would like to stress that our life is not very long, we can not sit and wait for magic. We must do our lives, makes ourselves happy. We should try to smile at simple things, then our world will be brighter and happier.
