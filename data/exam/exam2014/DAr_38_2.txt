In our days public health is fastly decreasing. There are a lot of reasons for it. For example, air pollution in big cities, new technologies, that makes our life more easier, passive style of life: watching TV and sitting by the computer and other reasons. Some people think, that the best way to improve public health is increasing the number of sports facilities. I think it’s the good idea, but it cannot be enough. There are a lot of  more better ways to increase public health. But the most effective way to increase –is show to people the positive moments of sport by children. In our school sport activities were very popular, boy played football twice a week and girls always played a tennis on fisical culture lesson. Also there were a big tournament of volleyball between schools. A lot of people came to see games of strong teams. As the result in that period of time sport in a huge area were the most popular thing in their life. The second most famous game after olimpic games are tournaments between universities of whole world, it’s called “Universiada”. My best friend watches that tournaments and he always speaks about the sports, so all people of our group and parents also interested in that. In conclusion, I have to say, that in our days it’s difficult to increase the public health. However, children can show to other people how it’s important to tace care of health is not serious forms.
