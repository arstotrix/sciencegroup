The graph illustrates the rate of Australian post-school qualification between females and males in the 1999 year. 
The level of proportion is rather different for the every kind of qualification. It is noticable that female respondents prefer undergraduate diploma and Bachelor's degree. In contrast, there is over twice as many males who would like to get a postgraduate diploma, than females. Moreover, males also want to get master's degree. The main feature is that about 90% males have skilled vocational diploma as post-school qualification. The proportion of men and women whob want to get the post-school qualification is not balanced. Males are more likely to get the future education than women: the chart shows that there are about 300% of males and 200 of women who held the qualification in 1999. 
The main tendency is that there are some kinds of post-school qualification, which are extremely popular between each gender.
