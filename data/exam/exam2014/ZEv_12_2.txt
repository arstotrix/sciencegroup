There are a lot of countries where schools have some problems with puple and student behaviour. It is a difficult problem, and only serious methods will help to find the solutions to this problem.

Firstly, family as the social institute can be a solution. Parents must teach their children not only what is wrong and what is right, but also make them feel comfortable in the family, convinient. This is the first step, that will solve some problems with children behaviour. 

Secondly, school as the social institute can help with several problems. For example, every school must have a psychologist who will work with children, their problems and their solutions. Sometimes some teenagers want that someone will listen to them and hear them and it will help to confine  the emotions. 

Thirdly, the causes of the problem with the student behavior as I have mentioned are living in problems in the family and with the classmates. So, hobby sometimes can solve some problems. That is why some parents are trying to make their children feel in the team, and it also help to keep feet. Swimming, football, hockey and also computer games this is what can help to solve problems with the teenager behaviour.

To sum up, children are in need and their behaviour shows us that school teachers and parents must help them to find a solution.
