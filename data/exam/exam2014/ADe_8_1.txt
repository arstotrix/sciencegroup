  This table presents different ages of work-people in some spheres in the UK, between 1998 and 2006. 
  To begin with, it’s clearly seen, that the highest numbers of people we can observe in sector of education (112559; 124776; 125345; and etc). So, education sphere is the most popular sector for working than sphere of hotel and catering (hotel and catering – 17666; 15223; 8201 in the same year and the same age than in sphere of education). In sector of building we can underlaine that the popularity of this work is down in 8 years (for example in 1998 it was 112565 of people and in 2006 just 86430). But the smallest number of employers use can see in sphere of technology (800 in 1998).
  At the end, I would like to say that the difference between some chiffres is really huge (3090 and 54888) but we can’t see the unique tendence of growing numbers share with popularity of some sectors.
