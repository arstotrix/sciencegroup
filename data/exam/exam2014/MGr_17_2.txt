Everyone in the world wants to be really happy. No doubt, that, happiness is a necessary aspect of life. Happiness can be the main issue of discussion about what it really is. It is because of nobody can clearly explain is and suggest ways how how to achieve this. However, there can be some problems which are connected with difficulties and some factors whic are important in achievening this feeling.
There is an arguement that defining happiness is inconpenenseble. Personaly I think that the main difficulty is misunderstanding of hapiness. People donâ€™t know what the want! Basically hapiness is entirely about privacy. To find its meaning and understand their wishes, a lot of people try to do something new, change their mind and lifestyle or even fall in love or make new friends. Essentially, view of the hapiness are dissimilar. In other words some people find happinesse in their family, however others prefer to be alone. There are a lot of examples, but overall, everyone want to know a magical way how to reach happiness.
From my point of view it depends only on the person, his character. Behaviour and desires. Some people probably have a consideration that money as the majoc factor that provides hapiness. So, according to these desire, people are encouraged to have a great job which erandies to pay them a high salary. They believe that wealth will fulfill their dreams.
Nevertheless, others think that health is the most valuable factor. In addition, love is the main and necessary aspect which can make people happy.
To sum up. There are some pros abd cons about the real happiness. I believe that only a mix of all aspects brings people the unlimited happiness.
