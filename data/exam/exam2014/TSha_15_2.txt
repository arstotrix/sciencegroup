Education is the one of the most essential things that is needed for successful career. That is why a lot of young people tend to enter the University. Of course, some direction is more favourable for males and, on the contrary, some â€“ for females. Some people suggest that the equal numbers of males and females should be accepted in every faculty or subject.
According to my view, I totally disagree with this statement for a number of reasons. First of all, there are a lot of examples in the history of humanity that all occupations may have both males and females as specialists. The tendency to some activity is not dependent on the gender characteristics.
The second argument against is the fact that University will have more benefits if they accept the best students rather than just equal amount of males and females.
Finally, it has a place to say that modern society does not have any gender priorities. Nowadays the gender differences become less and a lot of business woman, for instance, appear, though, 50 years ago it was an exemption. Therefore, the plenty of occupations that were not feminine in the past today are changed and become unisex proffessions.
In conclusion, it is likely to be repeated that I totally disagree with the statement that universities have to accept the equal numbers of males and females. I provided my opinion by three reasons against, however, some people may find it, to some extent, good idea for a range of reasons. Inspite of this possibility I cannot even imagine their arguments.
