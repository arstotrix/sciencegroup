It is commonly accepted that crative people should be given the right of freedom in their work. However, there is also a widespread  opinion that government must control their work. 
It goes without saying that artist people such as painters, writer, actors, have a very special view on the world. They create masterpieces on the basis of their talent and inspiration. Moreover, they are said to be very sensitive and their emotions and feelings shouldn't be affected by any restrictions otherwise they can lose their artist spark. 
However, a lot of people think differently. They say that art belongs tto the society, so itmust be controlled by its government. Furthermore, they believe that not all forms of art can be correctly understood by different people. That is why government should define what kind of art is acceptable. 
In my view, artistic people should not be influence by any outer circumstances. Firstly, their work cannot be compared with other material things. Secondly, governments should not influence the development of culture and put pressure on people who create it. 
In addition for example listening music is most  interesting habit to all clases of people. Apart from the negative side, artists can keep traditional culture by making attractive music on native culture. In this sense, they are the wealth of a notion. Many historical books are taught as an academic lesson in school and college. It artists have more freedom in terms of writing may be encouraged of their creativity in art fields. 
In conclusion, artistic world is really sensitive and if it is controlled by governments orany restrictions are made, they certainly should notruin inspiration and destroy the ideas of talented people.
