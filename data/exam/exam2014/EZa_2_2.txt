What is happiness? Many philosophers tryed to define this word. Why it is so hard to do it? Because every person is a large system and there is a considerable range of factors that may determine the feeling of happiness. There can be some factors in order to achieve this feeling such as having an interesting work, family and the aim to be happy.
Firstly, the interesting job is very important in everyone's life. Knowledge of the fact that your work is very important and you really have a chance to somehow change the world shows that work is very interesting to you. It gives a lot of emotional energy back to person and help him feel amazing diring all the life.
Secondly, having a family is very important if person wants to be happy. If someone loved and doesn't feel himself lonely, he will be more happy than lonely person, for sure. 
Thirdly, there is a very significant factor in achieving happiness such as an intension to be happy. There are a plenty of examples of disabled people who are happy, so that it can be concluded that happiness is not something thet surrounds you, it is something in the mind. Consequently, those people, who  hope to become happy without having this kind of aim never do it.
To conclude, happiness is the most important thing in everyone's life and is very difficult to define. There are some factors that may help people become happy such as interesting work, family and mind's intention to be happy. Every person live his own life once, so I think we all should try to be happy and to share our happiness with others.
