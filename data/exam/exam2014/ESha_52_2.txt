There is a wide spread opinion that the rise the quantity of sports issues can provide people with possibility for making better their health. Nevertheless, there is a interesting idea that this policy would have small impact on citizens welfare.


First of all, it is obvious that the public health is inexorably linked with the possibility of doing the sports. It is almost impossible to overestimate the importance of sport facilities nowadays. The research maded in 2010 by harvard, explains that than more sport opportunities in the country than public welfare is better.  According to this research, the amount of sports centres and clubs correlate with the number of sportsmen in this country. That is why, the increasing the quantity of sport centers, can provide to the country more healthy citizens.


Not with standing this fact, many people believe, that such programmes are not closely connected with citizens' welfare. The key argument for this is the possibility of having a great impact on health by bad habits. Smoking and drinking alcohol are cause people illness. The main solution linked with this problem is alcohol sell banning. On the one hand it can improve public health, on the other it can cause the new problems, such as economic decline. It is obvious that our export closely connected with alcohol and sigarettes sell that is why this measure can cause tall in GDP of this country.


To sum up, from my point of view, the improving of welfare system due to increasing the quantity of sports facilities is a really good idea. Nevertheless, we should understand that this also depends on peoples' bad habits.
