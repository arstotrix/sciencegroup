Recently, there has been considered discussion of acception male and female students at universities. Some people reckon that equal numbers of men and women should be accepted in every subject. I don’t agree with such statement and think that universities should not put the gender framework. In my essay I will try to show the main reasons to support my point of view.
First of all, we can say about different opportunities of male and female students. I mean that generally men have tend to technical subjects, whereas women have tent to arts subjects. In addition, every person has own talants and hobbies and can chose any direction. I mean that if majority of male students would like to choose arts subjects, but they can’t do it because they have limited number of opportunities, while other subjects remain empty. What is more, exist such subjects which are not interesting for male students.
In conclusion I would like to say that universities should not accept equal numbers of male and female students, because students have to decide themselves which subjects they would like to study.
