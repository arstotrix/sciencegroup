Some people think that people who are in creative professions, such as artist, should be free and do not have any government's restrictions on what they do.


Creative people have another structure of work than people who are, for example, work officer, engeneer or doctor. They must have a lot of time for their work, because if government wants a good film, a good concert, a good library with a lot of beautiful books, a brilliant exibition or another art event, it takes some times. For example, if people need to open art gallery, they will found of artists, whose picture will be in this gallery. And this artist must preper ther pictures for it and he need in time. Also singer must preper some list of song for a big performance.


However creative artist must have some restrictions. They are people of art and they must give a good example for people who are not creative, but want know something about art and also for children. Creative people shouldn't use bad actions and words or something else in their arts that can have bad influence on people who are interested its.


In my opinion, creative people have very big influence on local population, local culture and foreign people. They must give a lot of good information which can do people more kind, clever, developed and creative, so they must have some restrictions.
