Some people tend to believe that the government should give freedom to creative people to express their ideas in any way they want. Others, however, assume that government should act to restrict these artists.


In my opinion, creative people should not have a complete freedom in expressing their views. First of all, if people will have the right to speak freely, other groups of people may suffer. For example, the racism may be created because of the complete freedom of people to say what they want. On the other hand, some diplomatic problems between countries can be caused by disrespectful and inappropriate films, pictures, music; in other words, it can result in important and even dangerous political issues.


Nevertheless, there are some people who think that a complete freedom should be given to creators so they can express their thoughts. They assume that in the free society people should have right to speak out loud their ideas. Moreover, some argue that there could not be any creativity if there are some rules for artists to follow. However, they failed to realize that lack of respect to other people resulted in any type of creation. Sometimes can cause a serious problem connected with nationalism.


All things considered, although many people think that creative people should express their thoughts in any way they want, I strongly believe that some restrictions should be made for people creating any artwork; people should respect each other and do not doubt each other's rights, even if they have different views on any issue. Any artistic creation should be a piece of pure art, not the proposal.
