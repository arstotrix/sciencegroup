Nowadays with modern conditions of life including polluted air, water, fast pace of life and too much fastfood people need to think a lot about their health and take some measures. Some are sure that it is enough just to increase the number of sport facilities for improving our health, others claim that it is a waste of money and it will not really influence people. So, who is right? On the one hand, sport clubs and other sport events and activities made more people to keep themselves in a good form. It is becoming up-to-date to have a fit body and to visit sport clubs. Furthermore, more and more people refuse smoking and drinking alcohol because of its sport-addiction. Finally, different kinds of public facilities is a very convenient way of doing sport for those people who can not do it professionally, but they have an ability to loose some energy after their job. On the other hand, any sport facilities can change peopleâ€™s minds. There are so many people who can use sport facilities and eat fastfood, have some other bad habbits such as smoking at the same time. Apart from that, it can not decrease air, water pollution because of which people suffer so much or cure cancer. I also support the idea that sport facilities is not the only measure we need to take. It must be complex and include as lessons at schools about healthy way of life as prohibition of smoking in all public places and many others. In conclusion, I would kike to say that of course implanting of different sport facilities in our daily life has some results and more and more people care about their health and about the way they look. But it is not enough anyway. The measures must be complex and they should influence mental part of our life, as well as our appearence.
