Creative artists must always show their works. They must have freedom to express themselves without any government restrictions. As for my opinion, I agree with this statement.
The First argument is that artists can create new fantastic and amazing ideas in words, pictures, music or film and so on.
It can be a new step in development of arts of this country and, of course, in development of international of arts. And some government restictions can lead to the dip of arts. For example, it's the USRR in 1950-1960.The government didn't give to develop new kinds of arts and that's why soviet artists couldn't show their works in the World. They were unmodern and boring.
The second point is that it is getting not only the development of arts, but it's getting the development of all society.
New ideas in arts can be new schools in arts and it can lead to new educational programs for people.
The third point is the pluralism of values. The freedom to express their own ideas is a value of liberalism and democracy. If we want to live in free and safe society, we must have such values. Moreover, liberlism as ideology, wins other idedogies.
Another point of view is that artists can decrease a role of government for people and citizens of this country. I think, that it can be a bad consequence and it can lead to political unstability. But, if we have liberalism, and if we believe in liberalism values, we can be sure that all people are rational people and they will be protect their government too.
All it all, I would like to underline, that in my opinion the freedom of express is good value for society.
