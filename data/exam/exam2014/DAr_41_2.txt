Today many people are trying to keep a healthy lifestyle. They think it helps them to be fit and healthy. Sports is one of the essential parts of the healthy life style, in their opinion. That’s why some people think, that increasing the number of sports facilities is the best way to improve public health. Is it true, or people who support the opposite point of view (that his would have little effect on public health and that others measures are needed) right? On the one hand, many scientists say, that sports really helps to be healthy. And many people agree with it, but they have no chance to take up some sports activities, because of shortage of time or money, for example. So, if some organizations will open gyms on their territory, it will give a lot of people an opportunity to make some physical exercises during the working hours and for free. And as a result, workers will become stronger and healthier. On the other hand, there are a lot of people, who hate sports. They don’t want to keep a healthy lifestyle. In this case, a great amount of sports facilities will not help. It means, that people of this kinds need other measures to improve their health. To sum up, the answer for the question will be “It depends”. It depends on people. Some of them will be happy by getting a lot of sports facilities and will improve his/her health. However, there is another category of people who can not or what is more do not want to improve their health by sports. And for such people, other measures are required (for example, making food with lower fats or annual visiting doctors, making computer scanning). In my opinion, the best way to improve public health is using different kinds of measures (not only increasing the number of sport facilities).
