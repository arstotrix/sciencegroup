Nowadays a huge number of people work more than 8 hours a day and they do not have enough time to do sport. Also people can not choose their own kind of sport is due to they want to do something special and interesting.
On the one hand, the increase of the amount of sports facilities can bring some improvement to people's health. Firstly, people will become more motivated if they have an opportunity to do an interesting and funny kind of sport for example, grass hockey or golf. People will spend more time with their friends and relatives doing sport activities and their health will improve. Secondly, the big number of sports facilities needs more sports centres to be opened. So that people will visit them more often.
On the other hand, a lot of people do not believe that such a measure can help to improve public health. A lot of people have a possibility to buy a membership card in fitness centres but they do not do it because they are lazy and prefer to watch TV or play computer games in the evening. In this case, the change in the number of sports facilities will not increase the level of people's health. More than that, new sports options can be rather expensive and people will not be able to pay for it.
To sum up, I think that the rising number of sports facilities can really improve the health only if they will be interesting and convinient for people. However, new opportunities should be adopted for all people and should be situated in suitable parts of cities.
