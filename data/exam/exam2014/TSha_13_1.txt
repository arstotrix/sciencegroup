The line graph illustrates the percentages of people aged 65 and over during one hundred years. The data relates to population of three counties between 1940 and 2040.
In 1940 the proportion was almost the same with 5% in Japan, 10% in the USA and approximately 7% in Sweden. Movewer, by 1980 the huge difference has established. In Sweden and the USA the percentage was almost 15% while in Japan this indicator was below 5%. Approximately in 1990 there was a great rise of population aged 65 and over in Sweden, whereas in the USA proportion was steadily since 1980. As we can see the proportion in each of three countries is predicted to go up after 2020.
To sum up, it can be clearly seen that during the whole period the proportion of population aged 65 and over has risen. In addition, it is predicted that by 2040 this amount will rich almost 25% in every country.
