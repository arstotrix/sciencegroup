The diagrams below show us the situation of populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and predictions to 2050 year, depending on ages of people.
On the first graph we see that 46.3% of population of Yemen were 15-59 year old people. Half of the population were 0-14 year old people and only 3.6% were 60+ year old people. But if we look at the second graph, which shows us projections for 2050, we can see that situation will change. The number of 15-59 year old people will increase for 11% but the number of 0-14 will fall and become 37%.
Another situation we can see on third and fourth graphs which are devoted to Italy. Here we see that in 2000 61.6% of population were 15-59 year old people, 24.1% were 60+ year old people and only 14.3% of people were 0-14 year old people. In 2050 the situation will not dramatically change. The number of 15-59 year old people will fall for 15.4%, but the number of 60+ year old people will increase less than for a half of the population and the number of 0-14 will fall too and become 11.5%.
