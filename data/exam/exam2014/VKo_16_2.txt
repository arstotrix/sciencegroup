Nowadays the issue of the degree of freedom is extremely important. Artists and other creative people raise this problem rather frequently as their activity is close to freedom, self-expression and fantasy. I strongly believe that government should not restrict this part of our life.
First of all, the contemporary world is connected with politics and there should be such a sphere of our life which is free from obligations and other biases. If we do not have it, we will be under the risk to go back it the days of totalitarism.
Also, the art is the only sphere where people are allowed to express all their feeling ang emotions. Government has not the righ to interfere in a human's mind.
What is more, the quality of art may suffer from restrictions. If artists do what they are told to, their activity will not have any sense as it will be just a government's order.
On the other hand, some artists express the wrong ideas, which are immoral indeed. The creations of some people are full of propaganda of violence, drags and unappropriate behavior. So, government should control it.
In conclusion, artists should be free in what they do, if it is not offensive for anyone and distructive for the society.
