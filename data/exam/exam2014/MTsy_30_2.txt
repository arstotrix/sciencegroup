In todays world an opinion that sports facilities should be deviced for public health improvement exist. In spite of this, other people suggest that there is no point for developing this side of issue.
It is obvious that sport plays significant role in health of people. Average person should does some sports regularly, if he/she want to stay fit and healthy. Some people are not able to do some sports because there are just a few sport centres in the area, where they live, moreover, this gyms can be very expensive. If government provide a big number of sport facilities, people will have more opportunities to improve their health by doing some sports. As we know, sport can normilise blood pressure; help your heart work and prevent the development of obesity.
Despite these facts, some people think that creating more sports centres will not be enough for health improvement of huge numbers of people. Other ways of solving the problem should be invented or devised. Creation of sport facilities does not automatically foster the people to do sports. in modern reality people sometimes do not have time to attend gym or swimming pool Moreover, people can bring harm to their health by eating unhealthy food, drinkink alcohol and spending long hours behind the computer screens. That means that some measures should be implemented in that direction. And some kind of healthy way of life propaganda should be done.
In conclusion, I want to say that increasing the number of sport facilities has positive impact on peoples health only in case of co-working with other measures, which should be brought. Overall, some steps should be done towards the awarness of people about their health and way of life.
