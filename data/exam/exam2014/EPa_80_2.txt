Sport has always been considered to be a part of healthy way of life. That is way there is an opinion that being of new sport facilities is the best way to improve public health. Nevertheless I think that everything is not so clear about that. 
There is no doubt, that sport is the best way to keep fit. More than that some people improve their health after serious injouries by doing  sport and it helps quiete good. There is a common practice for disabled people to start doing swimming, which helpes them to coordinate their movements in a better way.
On there other hand there are sports that are dangerous for peoples health. Sometimes this danger is not such permament thing like broken bone or twisted leg, but ones that appear in older ages like problems with heart or ackhe in your knees. There lots of proffesional sport veterans suffering from health problems connected or specified with their sport discipline. 
Also there are more obvious ways of improving public health. Ways that are generally connected with health like medicine and health industry. Building new medicine centres and promoting health care programms could be more efficient ways of rising peoples health level. Sometimes people, who have health problems, forget about caring for themselves even if they are doing sport regulary. Alexander Pluschenko, for example, had injured himself during last Olympic games, despite the fact that he knew about his health problem. 
In my opinion sport is a good thing to keep your health at a good level, but if we are looking for the best way of improving public health, we should look at another things. I consider promotion of health caring programms to be a good place to start.
