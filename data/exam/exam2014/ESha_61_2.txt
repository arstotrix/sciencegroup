Nowadays there is a point that the growth of sport facilities will certainly perform public health. However other people do not believe in follow result and argue that the situation is needed different measures to be done.


First of all, wide-spread sport clubs and other sport departments partly influence the public health. What is important to say is the diversity of sport facilities is not a reason of improving the people's health. To be honest it is only a result of modern tendency. The affect of such sport centers might have an addition to the tendency that provides the idea of healthy lifestyle. Hence, I generally believe that the setting up a new sport facilities does not affect the general situation with the health.


The government and mass-media should deliver the right informaton to do the nation more healthier. If  different sport events which take place every week or month will be discussed in public and on TV channels we would have a strong ability to rise the level of health. However in recent years there are much more on-line translation of such events as Olympic Games, World Football Cups and so on but it still not  abundant.


The other point of view should be proven as undoubtedly the diversity of such sport centers can retrieve the popularity among the coming of age auditory. Moreover, it is convenient to people who can afford some rich clubs to choose the available one. As we can see it has some pluses too.


To sum everything up, I can state an opinion that it is more effective to do more advertisement and to try to make believe the people that the health is one of those targets that they cannot achieve without their desires and their own stimul.
