Nowadays when the dozens of factors influence on people's health governments try to improve public health by increasing the number of sport facilities. But some people say that it wouldn't have much effect and that goverment should provide other measures.


Firstly, I would like to mention that it is important that every person took care about his health by itself. If we would count on government this duty that wouldn't have any effect at all. That is why it is important to use complex measres to solve this problem.


It is necessary to provide the ideas of healthy way of a lits to the children since they are in school. Government should make popular to be health and being a member of different clubs which provide healthy way of a life. The general goal of these measures is to create a generation which has a stimule to be healthy.


Since one generation of people with such kind of stumules grew up there will be no such urgant need in supporting this advertisement of health lifestyle, because those children with the ideas of improvement their health, probably will make their own children to stick such kind of lifestyle. And the only important purpose for government will be only to create new sport centers or sport grounds for them.


In conclusion I would like to say that it is not enough just to provide the population of coubtry with necessary sport facilities, it is far more important to populize the healthy lifestyle among citizens of country, that they had a wish to be healthy.
