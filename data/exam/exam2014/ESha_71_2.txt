The problem of increasing of nation's health is one of the most valuable nowadays. There is an opinion that more will be the improvement in public health only by including sport in our today's life. Others claim that another solution should be found.


Firstly, one of the advantages of increasing number of sport facilities is that people will start to move. Active life style is one of the best way to increase the level of healthy population. The action that could be made for this is to increase the number of hours of Physical training in school, colleges or universities. It will have a positive effect on the youngest age group. Outdoors activities for workers. That will take place monthly or the corporative gym that will be free to use for workers would help to make sports move popular.


Other measures that will affect people health could be lectures or seminars in schools or colleges about healthy life style. People will know more information about harmful products or activities. To low prices on sports equipment or activities, like swimming pool, will increase the public health.


As for me, I guess that the increasing of sport activities in our life is the most effective way to improve people's health. But there could be no global changes without other measures too. So to conclude, government should try to change the people's mind and up.
