On the graphic we can see an amount of people aged 65 and over from 1940 to 2040 in Japan, Sweden and USA.

Firstly, the most dramatic changes can be seen in Japan, where the proportion of old people increased from 5% to 27%. The line, that is dedicated to this country, will sharply rise in 2030. Secondly, the most predictable line is the one, that stands for USA. There was less then 10% of this particular age group in 1940. In 1960 the situation changed with 10% and in 1980 the proportion reached a peak of 15%. In addition, the number of old aged people in Japan has some falls, comparing to the other graphs, where the numbers are only rising.

To conclude, there is a tendency of growing in number of people, who are 65 and older. This tendency is occurring in all of the countries that are shown in the graph. However, changes in proportion, that are soft and calm for USA and Sweden, are sharp for Japan.
