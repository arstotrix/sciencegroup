Freedom of artists is an issue that generates debates among public and government.
On the one hand, artists are really unusual persons, having amazing abilities or skills. They have special mind, outlook and they can not be as usual person, because artists have their world.
On the other  hand, it is claimed that all people have equal rules, rights. It seems impossible to make special laws only for artists. And especially government could not give them opportunity to do all what they want. 
Thus, possessing absolutely freedom artists can damage freedom of others. Maybe not all of people are inspired by their pictures or music. Also some amateurs among artists have unsocial ideas, another draw bodies of people. It is not suitable for childrenâ€™s mind. In such case government should safe part of society from this art making some restrictions, for example for age group of children and others.
But it does not mean that all result of art should be only kind, suitable for children, artists have freedom for their imagination. They can do any pictures or films. But not everybody person could see it.
Thus, all of these restrictions, doing by government lay not on the artists mainly, but on the visitors of different exhibitions, cinemas, museums.
Taking everything in account, artists possesses a huge freedom, but their freedom ends, where beginning freedom of another person. And main restrictions lay on amateurs of art, because government create many rules and laws for visitors.
