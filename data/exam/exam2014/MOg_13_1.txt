The table shows underground railway sistems in six cities: London, Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles. There is an information about date opened, kilometres of route and passengers per year (in millions).
The first metro was opened in London in 1863. It is also the longest underground among the listen cities, its length is 395 kilometres. In 1900 the underground railway systems was built in Paris. Then this type of transport was opened in Tokyo (1927), then in Washington DC (1976) and Kyoto (1981). The youngest underground was built just 13 years ago in Los Angeles. Because it is constructed rather recently, it has a small distance in kilometers, only 28. However the shortest route of underground is 11 kilometres in Kyoto. This city has a little numerical flow of passengers, over 45 million people per year. But in Tokyo more than one billion people used the underground.
To sum up this information, it is possible to draw a conclusion. Older the underground is than longest kilometres of routes.
