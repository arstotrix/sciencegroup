The question of government restrictions was especially important in the 60s in the Soviet Union. By knowing the history, I absolutely agree with the statement that the art should be out of any political or ethetical broadens.
Today in all civil world books, films, singles aren’t restricted by the politicians. For example, there are some singers in Russia who aren’t afraid to speak about the injustice of the Russian law. From the other hand, the incident of Pussy Riot became known to the whole world. In the human’s history the development of art reached the peak during some historical events. The famous writer of the Golden Age of russian poetry Pushkin was a dekabrist, for example. In this way I consider that sometimes the restrictions develop the Art, make it more innovative. When some people do not like the situation in their country, they always speak about it in their songs, films, books, pictures and etc.
But the government is a great power, and it is necessary to remember about it. And sometimes the influence of the government can be so distructive that the art would be almost killed. 
During the repressions of Stalin not very many artists were brave enough about the things which had happened in the country. So the art was innatural; it was a lie for looking like good and right soviet man. In the 60s, after the death of Stalin, all these things that had not been spoken about began to appear with enormous intense. In this period the type of artists named abstagonists appeared at the stage. But their pictures weren’t understood by the government, so the restrictions began again. It was not in their power to strike with this great force, some of artists went abroad, other stayed to their sorrow.
The art will always alive, but in some situations the restrictions can make it poor, can make the people suffer.
