The problem of public sports is widely spread nowadays and seems to be essential. As far as I am concerned, there is a plenty of methods aiming to solve this issue. Moreover, every method has its own pros and cons. Increasing the number of sports facilities is one of them and this method is concerned to be quite arguable. Some people believe that this method will dramatically increase the level of health of our society. They are deeply convinced that sports facilities will inspire citizens to do some physical activities. For instance, football, fitness and so on. It could be said about both types of facilities: free of charge like public stadiums and facilities you must pay for, like fitness clubs. On the other hand, there are people who are convinced that this method is not effective. Obviously, a large number of facilities is not enough to motivate people. Undoubtedly, there must be a better source of encouragement to make coach potatoes move and become active. For instance, it could be some special social ads aiming to inspire everybody to do some sports. These ads must be effective enough to make people burn the candle at both ends while doing fitness or something like that. Therefore, a plenty of sports facilities will not do all the job on their own. I am deeply convinced that the only way of solving this problem is a proper combination of methods discussed earlier. Apart from that, I suggest the majority of sport facilities must be free of charge. There is no doubt, that not everybody can afford a membership in elite sports club. Goverment must make an effort to make sports a significant part of life of any citizen. To sum up, I would like to mention once more that the issue of public health needs a complex of different that problem could be solved in a nearest future. If people really wanted to be healthy, they would already have been doing sports daily.
