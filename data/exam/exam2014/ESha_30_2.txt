Nowadays there are many people who think that the government should give creative artists more freedom, because only on this way they can express their feeling. Let's us discuss about this problem. 


On the one hand there are people who think that the government should restrict artists, because they change the way of thinking not in good way. For example, museums and galleryes open their's door for teenagers and if young generation see this strange pictures, they can loose interest for other traditional art. Moreover, there are many awful film which people can see switch on the TV. People just waste their time because they can't see healthful TV programmes. Some people say that more and more traditional museums are closed because for people it becomes uninterst and unpopular.


But there are people who think that artists help us to know more about modern art and our culture. For example, there are many modern art galleries in the world where you can see beautiful pictures, watching amazing film and hearing unforgetable music which can open your eyes for new feeling. Moreover, creative artists can help you developing your skills and knowledge. It is also important to find something knew for yourself. Most of creative artists are younger people and the government should help them to improve their way of feelings and thinking which is really important.


In conclusion, I think that government should help creative artists improve their knowledge and skills because it can be interesting not only for young deneration but and older people too.
