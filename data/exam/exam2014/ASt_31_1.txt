This table shows us some data on big cities especially underground railway systems. Information includes such positions as "date opened", "kilometers of route" and "passengers per our".
 Generally speaking, we can underline leaders in cach point. The oldest metro is located in London. This metro is also the longest compare to others. It is opened in 1863 and it is 394 kilometers long. But from anoter point of view London subway is only at the third position by popularity. The most popular metro is situated in Tokyo 1927 million passengers are using this railway every year. Now let's move to another "records". The newest railway system is opened in 2001 in Los Angeles. The shortest metro is in Koyoto. It is only 11 kilometers long. This could be a reason of low popularity of this system. 45 million passenger compare to 1191 million in metro in Paris is rather small number. Washington DC metro is more popular than in Koyoto and Los Angeles but with number 144 million per year it is clear that this underground is not a leader.
To sum up, it is impossible to draw any tendency between these data. These numbers could be used only like an information. This table gives us main points about railway systems in London, Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC, Koyoto and Los Angeles.
