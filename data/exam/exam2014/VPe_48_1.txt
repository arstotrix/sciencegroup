The diagram illustrates the changes in percentage of old people ( 65 y.o. and older) in Japan, Sweden and USA during the period : 1940 to 2040.
Overall, it can be seen that in all countries the proportion of population aged 65 and over has increased in recent 100 years. In detail, as for USA and Sweden – they have quite a similar dynamic: the number of “older” population in these countries rose steadily till the begining of 1980 and then was exchanged by a period of stagnation : in USA this period was a bit longer, than in Sweden: till 2020 (compared to 1985 in Sweden) . After that these countries had a dramatic increase of old people which peaked in 2040 by 25% in both USA and Sweden.
As for Japan, its dynamic differs between 1940 and 2025: there was a big dip in percentage of old people during this time which was continued by the period of dramatic increase.
