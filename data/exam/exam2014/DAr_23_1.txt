These diagrams show us the changes in the populations of two different countries on 2000 and in 2050. Looking to the graphs of 2000 year, we can see the huge difference beetween the ages of people in Italy and in Yemen. Yemen is a young-populated country, about 50% of people are children. According to this fact, we can make a conclusion, that Yemen hadn’t demographic problems in the beginning of the 21th century. There are only 3,6 percent of old people in Yemen, and their number won’t be much bigger. In 2050, the number of middle-aged people will rose, and will be approximately 60%. The other situation can be noticed in Italy. Unlike Yemen, this country has strange demografic problems. The small number of children in 2000 years will decrease and will be only 11,5% in 2050. Also, the number of old people, that was about a quater of all population, will rose and should be 42,3%. I think, Italian government should do something to solve this problem. For example, they can make a social programs like in our country, to make the population younger.
