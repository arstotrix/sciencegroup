The bar-charts illustrate the ages of the populations of two countries (Italy and Yemen) for the periods (the year of 2000 and projections for 2050). Overall, there can be observed a slight rise of the elderly population in both countries and the significant decrease of the young one.


While there is a marked increase of the middle-aged population in Yemen (46% in 2000 to 57% in 2050), the same cannot be said about the people of 15-59 years old in Italy, as their percentage plummets (61% in 2000 to 46% in 2050). However, there is a trend for both countries in the rise of the elderly population, although in Italy it is much more significant than in Yemen. Finally, the decrease of the young population is seen, but it is much bigger in Yemen than in Italy.
