Nowdays people are constantly chasing after happiness, it has become the main goal in everyone’s life. But the question is what is happiness?
I don’t think there is a proper way to define happiness. You don’t know what happiness os until you experience it and each time it can be caused differently. Some say money brings you happinness, some say love, but is it truly this simple?
First of all, let’s not forget that all human beings are different, with different values and backgrounds, we were taught differently. So some believe that happiness is something that can’t be bought or made it’s not materialistic – something you can reach or achieve in your life. Love, family, harmony. On contrary, there are people who strongly believe that happiness is in their job, in money they get, in many many houses they can have. Maybe these new shoes will make you happy so you go and buy it.
Another thing is that people of different cultures see happiness in different ways. While the West world is more self-centered, the Eestern is all about collective values. Westerns think of happiness as something that can only be achieved if you succeed in life, Easterns though find happiness in belonging to a community, being a good mother or father, for example, they live as their parents expect them to.
Furthemore, there are different religions with their own perception of happiness, their followers have to agree with these perceptions.
There’s no such thing that can define happiness in a simple word of sentence.
In conclusion, I’d like to say that happiness is a very tricky topic to talk about. It means different things to different people and each one descides what it means to him and finds his or her own ways of achieving happiness. But clearly it is one of the main goals on lives of almost everybody.
