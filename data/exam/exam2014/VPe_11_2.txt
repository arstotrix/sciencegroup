Nowadays, there are a lot of opinions about young people’s work. In some countries they are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies. Let’s discuss all prons and cons of it. 
First of all, I want to say that a gap year it’s a really good help for young people after school, because , usually, they don’t know what university they want to choose or what they particularly want to do , besides , it’s the best opportunity to get an experience , to meet new friends and to earn some money.
On the other hand this year can interrupt people’s education, because travelling and well-paid work very attractive for young people. It’s generally agreed that now many people have a dream to earn a lot of money without efforts. We have some examples , when the young people reached a success without university education and even without high school education, but it’s only a story , a fairytale. We should pay for all in our life.   
In my opinion, a gap year it’s very good thing only if your parents have possibilities on it. So many young people can not afford themselves , university education and they need to find the job. When I was finishing my school , I did not know what way I want to choose and I was very afraid . 
To draw the conclusion one can say that we should only think about our future.  A rest or a work can disturb or can help, it depends on us.
