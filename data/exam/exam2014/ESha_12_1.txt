By contrast, the smallest percentage for males was for those who desided to hold undergraduate diploma, but for females it was the greatest number (near the 70%). The same percentage of men got postgraduate diploma, but for women it was only 30 percent. However, more females held Bachelor's degree than males (around 55 percent for first ones and 15 percent for second).
