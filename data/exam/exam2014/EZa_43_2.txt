The most creative artist need a freedom to fully disctose their inner world, talent and quality. And government must not introduce their restrictions which can prevent artist's creation. 
I believe, theat there are alot of talented artists who can upend our world. Thge modern society are buidt on culture-books, classic musics, theaters, arts and etc. If we lost it we lost the basis on which the world stands. Artists who wont to express themselves, they need a freedom, but government administend a huge amount of sanctions, because of this many ingenious work do not appear ordo not go to people. 
But if government stops to administrate restrictions it can bring bad influence. For example, the existenceof such works which contain discriminatry wiews, may result that there will be civil wars and different kinds of it.
