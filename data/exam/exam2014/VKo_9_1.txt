This diagram illustrates different stages of education after school in Australia. This is a complex process which consists of five levels.
The chart gives us information about the gender in 1999. It can be seen that males got more past-school qualifications than females. The males were leading at skilled vocational diploma, postgraduate diploma and master's degree, while females were better at undergraduate diploma and bachelor's degree. The graph shows that the most popular post-school qualification among females was undergraduate diploma and the most unpopular was skilled vocational diploma. Moreover, there was a contrast situation in males post-school qualifications where skilled vocational diploma was the most relevant. As we can see from the chart there were big differences between females and males preferances in qualification in Australia.
The noticeable fact is that more than a half males and females got post-school qualifications in Australia in 1999, but they chose different stages of this education.
