We live in the modern, high-technologycal world with rapid and free access to different kind of information. However, it is quite difficult to define what happiness it.
From my point of view, it goes without saying, that tastes differ. According to this, there is not only one answer to the question revealed in the introduction.
Nevertheless there are some stereotypes about the success, but has nothing against with the happiness. Somebody consider that the main goal in their life is creating the family, others think it is a good job. As for me, I suppose, happiness is not achievement, it is a feeling of freedom, love or looking for you child. Hapiness is something light, something that you can’t describe as new flat, for example.
The main features of achieving these emotions are smile and kind, in my opinion. We should take it more seriosly, because happiness ensures the success. As for factors, which have influence on our feelings, I’d like to pay attention to family, weather and health. These are the basis of hapiness.If you have lovely people, see sum and you are healthy, there is no problem which you can’t reduce.
To sum up, I’d like to reccommened not forget that majority of us is happy. “You don’t lose your smile, you forget to use it”. It is very good principle to achieve happiness.
