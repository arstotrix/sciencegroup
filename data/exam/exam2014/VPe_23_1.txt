The first chart Mustrates how the reasons for study among students depend on their age. The chart shows five age groups. It is not hard to see that the thing which interests the youngest group most is its usefulness for their career. On the contrast, the eldest group finds their own interest in studying for more reasonable then its career use. As it can be seen on the chart the elder the age group is, the more reasonable it finds the interestin studying and less reasonable to study just for future career. These two reasons become approximately equal for 40 - 49 year age group, and the "interest"- reason engages another one only for over 49 year age group.
The second chart shows the employers supportment depended on the some age group. The largest supportment is required for the youngest group, and the least on - for the middle - age group ( 30-39 years). Employers' supportment goes down from the youngest group to 30 - 39 year group, there it meets its minimum, and then rise to the eldest group, but it is not higher than for the second group.
