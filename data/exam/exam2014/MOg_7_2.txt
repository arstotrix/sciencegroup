Scientists say that the characteristics of our personality depends on both our genes and socialisation during our life. Besides, genes have much more impact on our personality and development.
As a student of sociology faculty, I can not agree with the scientists completely although I admit that both the characteristics we are born with and experiences we may have in our life have some influence. In my opinion and the sociological point of view, the socialisation during our life and especially in our childhood plays the leading role in forming our personality characteristics. There are a lot of examples when two twins who lived in different families could not understand each other when they had met because of differences in their values and life understanding.
Not only sociologists, but also psychologists strongly believe that it is very important for children to live in a good family and communicate with kind, polite and intelligent people while growing up, because it will influence and enhance his life in the future. In addition, I have to tell that most children who were socialised in the streets and communicated with bad companies in their childhood could not became successful and wealthy people. Meanwhile, children from poor families who communicated with children from wealthy families had more chances to enter the university and had a better job later. So the genes can be a bit neutralised by a good socialisation tactic.
In conclusion I have to say that, in my opinion, both the characteristics we are born with and the experience in our life have a great impact on our personality, but our personal experience and the society we live in influence more considerable.
