We live in the age of dominating of liberal ideas and values of freedom and democracy, that is why many people believe that creative artists should have the freedom to express their ideas in any ways. On the other hand, there is a popular opinion that government can use some restrictions to prevent bad impact on the society.
In free states and democratic countries everybody have the freedom of speech and expression. Unfortunately, a lot of people understand this freedom as a possobility to say and do whatever they want. Our society grounded not only on rights but also on responsobilities. If somebody transmit his/her ideas on big audience he/she should be ready to be responsoble for his/her activity, if not government can use it's power, to protect citizens from somebody's actions.
On the other hand, people argue that using a power of a government can influence democracy and human rights. If governmental officials start using its power to destroy basic democratic values it can bring more serious effect that just somebody's ideas transmitted to society.
Finally, I can also express my own opinion: to my way of thinking we should find a compromise between governmental protecting and freedom of expression. Only high-developed civil society can judje what level of freedom for creative artists should be esteblished.
