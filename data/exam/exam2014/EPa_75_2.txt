Nowadays there are a lot of discussions about puplic health, and people always argue about methods of its improving. One people believe that it is better to provide more sport activities. Others think that this way has not lot of influence and other things should be done.
Firstly, let us consider the advantages of increasing the number of sports facilities. In modern world more people start to care about their health by doing some kind of sport. Lots of new facilities are being developed by for example sport comitees. Moreother more fitness centers appear. Finally, there is a huge improvement of conditions for disabled people. And a good example of this are paralimpic games. 
However, there are a lot of people who do not accept this poing of view. They are convinced that all these things have no huge influence on people`s health and other methods are required. May be they think not about facilities, but about improving the conditions of their life like doing something to prevent air pollution and enviroment damage. In this case, I think, both of ways of improving health are possible, so they can exist together that is way peopl with second point of view should not be agains the first. 
In conclusion I would like to say that to my mind there is a really good situation with sport in lot of countries and if people want to do something for their health they should not blame their government and say that it is not enough methods and facilities. But may be something new can be done in order to saticfy these people.
