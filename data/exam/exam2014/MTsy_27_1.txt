The pie charts show the information about the age brackets of Yemen and Italy populations in 2000. Besides, they gives predictions for 2050.
As it can be seen from the charts, there was more Italians at the age of 15-59 than Yemen's in the 2000. However, 0-14 Yemen's year-olds trebled the Italy one's and reached just over 50%. The percentage of people from Italy aged 60 or more was 24,1%, when the same group in Yemen was only 3.6%.
The projections for both cathegories follow by different patterns. It is predicted, that Yemen population will consist of a bit more than one half of 15-59 year-olds. 1/3 of 0-14 year-olds and only 5.7% will be occupied by people aged 60 or more years old by the 2050. The Italian population will be resulted in the next figures: 46.2% of people aged between 15-59 years old, 42.3% of the eldest group, 11.5% of 0-14 year-olds.
By observing the charts, it can be concluded that there is a marked tendency to become 'old' population for Italy, when Yemen will save the balance between 0-14 year-olds and 15-59 year-olds, while people, who aged 60 or more, will remain stable enough at a low.
