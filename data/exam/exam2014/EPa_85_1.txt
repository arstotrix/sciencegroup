These pie charts show us an information about the percentage of people of 3 age categories in Yemen and Italy in 2000 and 50 years later.
In both cases we can see that part of yong people in ages from 0 to 14 will be decreased in 2050, but the percent of people older than 60 years will raise within 50 years. It might be connected with development of medecine and decreasing in the number of borned children.
Also these charts show us a difference between first world country Italy and third world country Yemen. Level of live in Yemen is very low and only 3,6 percent of people are older than 60 years, but there are a lot of children are borned, now there are more children than adults in Yemen. But 50 years later situation in Yemen is predicted to change percent of adults will increase, while the number of children will decrease. Italy in 2000 has different situation.
