The graph presents the information and predictions about the part of old population (65 ages and more) in Japan, Sweden and USA over the period of 100 years from 1940 to 2040.
To start with, the trend of Japan will be regarded. In 1940 only 5% of the population was older than 65 ages. Untill 1950  this amount decreased to around 3% and stayed at this level until the middle eighties. However, after that the proportion of old population had a start to grow. In 2030 10% of population is predicted to be over the 65 ages. Moreover, there will be a rapid increase of 15% over the period of next three-four years. In 2040 this figure probably will be even more than 25%.
The other two countries have almost the same trends to each other. Over the period from 1940 to the middle ninties the trend of USA was always higher on 2-3%. These proportion had a growth from 1940 to approximately 1982. The next ten years showed decrease to 14% in USA and 13% in Sweden. After that moment trend of Sweden started to dramatically improve while the USA old population remained at the stable position. Taking prediction into account, until 2040 both USA and Sweden will have around 25% of aged 65 and over population.
Overall, it is crearly seen that the population of these three countries has a tend to become older. The most significant point, according to the prediction, will be 2030 because after this year fast growth of the proportion of old population is possible.
