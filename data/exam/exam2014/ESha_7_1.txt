The line chart shows the percentage of males and females who held the post-school qualifications in Australia in 1999.


As we can see from the line chart, the most popular qualification for males in 1999 is skilled vocational diploma, the 90 percent of men have it, and the less popular is the undergraduate diploma – only 35 percent of males have passed the exams.


In comparison the first place between qualifications for women was given to undergraduate diploma, 70 percent of females have it, while the last place is skilled vocational diploma – the line  chart shows what only 10 percent pf women have it.


If we look to the postgraduate diploma we can see what percentage of males which have it is 70%, and females have 30 percent, so the percentage of men is twice more when women.
