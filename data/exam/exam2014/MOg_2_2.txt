Some research shows that the characteristics we are born with have more influence on us than experience that we have in life.
I consider experience the major influence on our life. Characteristics we are born with are the basis of our personalities but experience can heavily influence on this basis. Basic characteristics can make studying of some subjects easier or harder. Some specific skills can be taught only if you have characteristics that make studying of this skills easy.
Life experience make people do some amount of choises in their lives. People can choose different ways of living, different works, different houses and different behaviour. Choices that people do in key points of their lives can affect their personalities in different way. People can develop some of their characteristics and change their lives. Rules of society can be very strict to people that have characteristics that can’ be somehow applied in society. Society can restrict actions of people with characteristics that can’t be used without bad consequences for other people. Choices that people make in their lives define their way of life.
