The table given illustrates the data on underground railway systems comparing the information of six cities all around the world.
Generally speaking, there’s a noticeable connection between the size of the city and the amount of passengers per year. Thus, Tokio figures are approximately ten times greater than those in Washington DC due to the fact that Tokio is one of the biggest megapolicies. Moreover, the data of the opening corresponds greatly with the route length. According to the factual evidence London is the leader on this factor having his underground system opened in XIX century and being the pioneer at this. It’s no wonder that the route length of this city exceed two times this of Paris that is being the second best at length feature.
On the other hand, the number of route kilometres doesn’t in any way correlate with the number of passengers over the year. Tokio with nearly 2000 passengers have only 200 kilometres of routes which is worse than in London when for 775 passengers there is around 400 kilometres of route.
