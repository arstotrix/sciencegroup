The graph illustrates the change in the number of old people in the USA, Sweden and Japan between the period of the 1940's and the 2040's.
As can be seen the proportion of the population aged 65 and over in the United States was the highest comparing with other countries in the middle of the twentieth century. From 194- to 1960 the number rose steadily in both countries: in the USA and in Sweden , while Japan experienced a slight fall in the number of old people by 4 per cent. However, from the 1960's it remained stable till middle 1980's . During the period from 1960 and 2000 the percentage in the United States and Sweden went up and down and currently is around 17 per cend in the Sweden and 14 per cent in the USA. The next 25 years it is predicted that rate growth will be faster and by the 2040's reaches around 25 per cent in all countries in question.
In conclusion, the number of people reached 65 and over will increase dramatically in developed countries.
