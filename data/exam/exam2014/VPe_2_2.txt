In some parts of the world students tend to follow a tradition of a so-called «gap year» between school graduation and applying to the university. This trend is believed to have its drawbacks as well as benefits. 
On the one hand, it is undoubtedly stressful to start university studies just after the passing high school graduation exams. The «gap year» allows students to take a necessary break and get prepared both mentally and in terms of study organization. A lot of students spend this time travelling , volunteering, exploring the world and society around them thus broading their mind.  Besides, a «gap year» can be used as an opportunity to reconsider some aspects of your future study and career, to make up your mind. Some students may be not mature enough to decide which course in the to take in the university. In such cases a «gap year» can make a difference as soon as these students try their hand at different kinds of occupation and see what fits them best. 
On the other hand, some specialists argue that a gap year can work as a disturbance in the process of study. Some students, who used to be consentrated on study at first, during a gap year may be discouraged from going to the university, ruin their social bounds and etc. Moreover, some people claim that a gap year is a waste of time which students rather spend on mastering their course, developing skills and other practical things, which are relevant for their future. What’s more, the situation in the educational system and career market is constantly changing, so students may miss or lose an opportunity to enter a good university with a prospective of a well-paid job if they take such a long break.
In conclusion, I believe that each person himself needs to decide taking into consideration his interests, aims and current situation, whether it is worth taking a gap year or not.
