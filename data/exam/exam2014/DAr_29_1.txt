The charts give information of populations of two conties: Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050. Let us summarise the information and report some of the features making comparison. Projecting for 2050 both Yemen and Italy show decrease in the population of children. A huge 50,1% of children aged 0 – 14 years in 2000 and projected to become 37,0% in the year 2050 for Yemen slowing down population growth in that country while Italy shows only a small drop from 14,3% to 11,5% in the year 2050. Other than that Italy is projected to have a huge rise in eldery population (aged 60 and over). From 24,1% in the year 2000 to as high as 42,3% projected in the year 2050. As for Yemen the projected growth of elders population seems to be very small, from 3,6% in 2000 to 5,7% in the year 2050; this can tell us that level of life quality is going to stognate hotyroning much. To conclude I’d like to say that main features have been reported, relevant comparisons have been made and that charts given are very interesting and gave me some food for thought.
