Studying process at universities has many problems, nowadays. The problem of unequality between male and female students appears to be a burning question. Some people think that some subjects should be mostly for men, others for women. I personally believe that all students should be equal to choose what subject to study.
To begin with, I am inclined to state that the most persuasive argument in favour of equal studying is that male and female students have different kinds of thinking. Men are to think more logically, while women have more extra ordinary thinking. It makes the process of studying more varied and effective. Moreover, equal communication between genders is always an advantage. When male and female students know each other better, all studying projects are worth doing and results are achievable. One more reason for equal numbers of male and female students in every subject is that while they are working and studying together they become more socially polite and friendly.
What is more, the majority of married people get engaged on those who were studying with at the university. Furthermore, for some people it is hard to adopt to unequal circumstances. For example, few boys feel uncomfortable among many girls.
However, to solve this problem is not as easy as it is believed. Nowadays, many univercities have their own rules which do not allow to attend some subjects for boys or girls. Or some subjects are not attractive to girls but boys.
Taking everything into account, the problem of unequality between male and female students is far from solving yet: I agree with the statement that attendance to the every subject should be equal among boys and girls, but it should be left to every person to choose whether to attend the subject or not.
