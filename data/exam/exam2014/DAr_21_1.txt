On the charts below, we can see the information about the ages of the populations of Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050. In 2000, 50,1% of population of Yemen is about 0-14 years old and less then half of citizens (46,3%) is 15-59 years old. And only 3,6% of people of Yemen older then 60 years. It means that population of Yemen is rather young. Due to projections for 2050, the ages of the populations of Yemen will change a little. About 57% of people will be 15-59 years old and 37% of people will be younger (0-14 years). Other part of population (about 5,7%) older then 60 years. Comparing ages of population of Yemen and ages of people of Italy, we may say that the biggest part of population of Italy in 2000 is older then in Yemen. Over the 60% of citizens belongs to 15-59 years group of people. And rather big percent of population (24,1%) older then 60 years.
