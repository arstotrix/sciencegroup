The table compares the number of people in age from 18 to 65 working in certain sectors in the UK in 1998 and 2006. The number of people working in technology has rapidly increased in each age group, especially in the youngest group of respondents in age from 18 to 25. In opposite, the sphere of building is not so popular as technology: they lost people in each age group. The sphere of hotels & catering became more attractive for people older 26 years: the number of people in this sphere decrease only in the youngest group of respondents. And in final group of people working in education, situation is not good: only people in age from 26 to 45 think that that sphere is perspective and workable; in other age groups numbers of people rapidly decrease.
