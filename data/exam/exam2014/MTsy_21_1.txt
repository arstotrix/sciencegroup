These charts below show population differents between Yemen and Italy in 2000 and projections for 2050. So, now I will give some description.
Let's have a look on graphes, which show present population in Yemen and Italy. There are three different groups: 《0-14 years》, 《15-59 years》 and 《60+ years》. In Yemen more than 50% are 《0-14 years old》 and only 14,3% in Italy. As we can see, in Yemen there is a little percent of old people, as in Italy it is 24,1%.
Now I want to write some words about projections graphs. As we can see, there is decrease of young people. In Italy we can see that the percent of two groups: 《0-14》 and 《15-59》 will down, but the number of 《60+》 will raise. In Yemen only the percent of one group: 《0-14》 will fall and the percent of 《60+》 and 《15-59》 will raise, but these percents will not very big.
In conclusion I want to say that government will try to raise up the percent of young population, help families with money, but the graph 《population》 will increase if only people want it.
