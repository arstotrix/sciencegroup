The number of minutes of local calls started with a value of 70 billions in 1995. Then it slightly grew to 90 minutes in 1998 and remained stable during the next year. Finally it dropped to a started value of 70 billions in 2002.
The number of minutes of national and international was equal just under a 40 billions in 1995. Then it gradually increased to 60 billions in 2002. The number of minutes of mobile calls started of the smallest level of approximately 3 billions, then it stadily went up to about a 10 billions in 1999. After it sharply rose to 15 billions in 2002 what means it became nearly to the number of minutes of national and international calls.
