The problem of importance of happiness in life is said to be very significant. It is very difficult to define, what every man needs for being happy. It seems evident that there are some factors for being happy such as having a family, having friends, having the opportunity to travel and being a high-paid worker.
It seems clear that having a family and friends are very important for everybody. Family and friends help you and give a support when you need it. For example, when a man have a good relationships with his family he become more self-confident and he knows that he would never be alone. Moreover, friends are the family which we choose by ourselves, that is why friendships are necessary for a happy man.
Finally, having a good job and being a high-paid worker are very important for men too, because a good job gives the possibility to become a respected person, meanwhile money will give you the possibility to buy everything you want and make presents to family and friends.
In conclusion, I would like to say that there are some main factors for being happy man. The happiness of everybody depends on these factors but in different proportions.
