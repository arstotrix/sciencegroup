The charts illustrate the most importants reasons for study among people of various ages and the amount of support they have got from their employers.
The first chart shows that the number of people who choose to study for career decreases steadily starting from 80% at the age of under 26 and finishing at about 20% at the age of over 49. On the conrary, people tend to study more for their interest as they get older (10% at «under 26» to 70% at «over 49»). And in the section «40 – 49» the amount of people from both groups is equal.
As for the support students get from their employers yonger people receive more help than the ones who are 30 – 39 years old. However, after that point the amount of support for older people starts growing gradually.
