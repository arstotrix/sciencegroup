The chart shows the gender proportions of people who took the post-school qualifications in Australia in 1999. 
The most noticeable thing to be mentioned is that skilled vocational diploma was extremely unpopular among women. It was more than 90% of people who passed thise courses are men. The different balance is showed in the undergraduate diplomas part of the chart. About 70% of people with these diplomas are women. 
On the other hand, 70% of postgraduate diplomas holders are men. Moreover, men had taken the greater part of master's degrees, more than 60%. And what is also interesting it is that the gender proportion of men and women among the bachelors is most the same, but there were a little more graduated females than males. 
To sum up, the most wider gaps between graduated men and women are in the skilled vocational diploma, undergraduate diploma and postgraduate diploma areas. Among the bachelors the gender proportion is nearly the same. And there are a little more men in masters group.
