There are two different point of view how to improve public health. First is to increase the quantity of sports facilities. Second is that the raising of facilities is not enough to effect on public health. 
As for me, I agree with first point of view, because I believe that sport is the best ways to improve anybody`s health. Ofcourse, such factors as health eating, sleeping, good relashionships have influence on our health, but sport does us stronger, we can do more useful things in shorter time. I can say, that people, who doing sport have one very useful skill â€“ it is time managment. People, who have time on sport also can find anaugh time for doing something else. For example is school, children, which are doing some sport more often have good marks, than those, who sitting at home and doing nothing. One more advantage to increase the number of sports facilities is that, when we have more possibilities to doing something, we can choose activity, that is more familiar for us. We have more wants to doing what is interesting for us, talking about improving sports facilities I also mean some spetial programm for example for children from not very rich familly. A lot of people nowadays can not doing sport because they do not have money for some activity, which is interesting for them. For example, if you want to be a ballroom dancer, you need a lot of money for shoes, clothes, seminars with best teachers. It is very beatiful kind of sport, but not available for some people. Unfortunately, government does not help people, and they have to do other things, that are not so interesting for them.
In conclusion I want to say, that sport is one of the best way to improve public health, but people not always have possibilities to do an activity, that the want to do. That is why an increasing of sports facilities number is the best way to improve public health.
