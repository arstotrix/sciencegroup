It is a fact that in some countries young people, who finished high school, want to take a gap year before their starting studies in university. There are some reasons for and against the statement, which is about decission to take a gap year.
That could be argued that a gap year is a good possibility for young people to become mature and make a right decission about their educational program for the future. According  to some experts, teenagers are so young to decide which profession is the great for them . That free year they could spent on different jobs and find some advantages and disadvantages of these professions. Therefore, a person could learn dome skills for higher education. While students are not clearly understand their subjects at university, others try to train their mind for that. Also, a gap year, which was spent to travelling, help to relax and explore the world and because of this, a person could make friends with people from other contries and become more tolerant for different cultures.
There are some reasons against idea of taking a free year between high and higher edication. Firstly, young people could become lazy, thereby they will not want to start university studies or find a job at all. Altough a man know that this year he must waste to learn some helpful life and educational skills, he could spend that sitting at home and doing nothing. Besides, a young person could became less clear-mind than people who have started the higher education after high school without delay. Without practice young people could lose their educational skills. 
To sum up, I believe that people, who take a gap year after their high school education, will spend that to improving their life and educational skills and then their studies at university will be easily and more understandable.
