The problem of public health in becomming more and more relevant mowadays, when we face with lots of envoronmental problems such as polution and radiation. Many people are definitely sure that the government should build more sports facilities to improve the health of the nation. However, others think that this measure would not be effective, because less people are interested in doing sports, while it is better to spend money on improving our ecological situation.
No doubt that doing sports make people more healthy and strong, especially if they have sitting life-style at their work. Moreover, sport gives opportunities to make your weight smaller and to build your body. People with strong body are less risky to become ill.
However, I think that every person can do sports without any special equipment. For example, such activities, as running and doing morning exercises do not involve some extra facilities. Besides, if people want to do some extraordinary kind of sport they can buy all nessesary equipment themselves.
On the other hand, there are other spheres that need to be improved. Otherwise, they will also provide a bad impact on our health. One of such spheres is invorenmental problems. Plants and factories produce lots of air and water polution, products are grown using pesticides, forests are cutting down.
All this factors influence our health much more badly than the lack of sport facilities. It is more important to invest money into ecological programms such as providing factories with special filters, planting trees, production natural products and other envoronmental programms. 
In conclusion, I want to say that the problem of public health is extremely important nowadays and we should spend more money is projects which will solve the reasons of such problem, such as poor ecology and we are not able to waste money on sport, which only helps to make our health better, but doesn`t deal with the reasons of this problem â€“ bad ecology.
