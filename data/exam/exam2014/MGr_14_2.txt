Everybody know that happiness is considered very important in life. In my opinion it is true. There are many reseacrch about linking happiness and effectiveness. And It is not surprise that happy emploee works better tan sad. It is easy to understand that happy person won’t have some physical or psychic problems. Happiness is people’s panaicea. Happy person will not think about problems he will be reaching his aim without doubts. On the other hand we may say that people all over the world pursuit happiness and it is their aim already. Just imagine if person already reached happiness how manny near things he will try to achieve.
It is hard to give clear deffinition to the word “happiness”. You can say that happiness is combination of factors that work together to make you happy or it is things that make your life perfect. In my opinion, these defenition make scence, but they are to abstract. The explonation of it is understandable and very humanity. All defenitions before were universal and it is the problem of them. Universality of them is killing most important human’s thought: I’m unique. Now we can say that defenition of happiness is unique and personalized.
As I already said happiness is personalized for every human and it is difficult to say what factors are important in achieving happiness. Moreover I want to say that I will not give you some universal factors. I’ll be talking only about my own experience. For me first factor that will help me to achieve happiness is combination of understanding my aims and hard working. Second is good education, it’ll help me to find interesting job that suits me. The third factor is love and family. I can not see them without combination. Love is giving aims and power to people.
In conclusion, I want to say that happiness will be interesting theme forever.
