When people think about what life they would like to live, they often wish that their lives were happy. When people congratulate someone, it is quite common to wish happiness. But what do we mean by " happiness"? What things can make a person happy?
It rather difficult to give happiness a strict definition. In fact it is hardly possible. The reason is that this concept is very subjective and it can be said that everyone has different things which can cause happiness. Also the problem is that happiness is a state of mind, it has psychological features, which make the definition even more complicated for the person who is not a specialist. 
Although it us hard to define happiness, some factors which can make people happy can be pointed out. In my opinion, first thing is love. As the Beatles sang "Love is all you need".  When a person fals in love, his or her mood becomes much better, everything seems great and easy. Family and friends are also very important. Is is widely known that it is easier to become depressed if you do not have strong personal relationships. 
One more thing is professional succes. If people go to work which they don't like, they are likely to be unhappy. And of course it is important to get satisfaction from the job. 
Also hobbies and art can make people enjoy their lives and become happy. Art often becomes a sense of life for people, they feel happy only if they create something. 
To summarise it can be said that different people have different things which make them happy. Some people look for somebody to love, others are in love with their jobs. Maybe, the greatest achievement in life is to find something that makes you happy and brings you joy. It will undoubtedly make your life more interesting and worth living.
