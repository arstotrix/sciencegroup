It is not a secret, that communication plays the biggest role in modern students’ lives.  Although, is some universities’ groups boys and girls are divided unequally. To my mind, groups should be formed by equal number of male and female as it can have an affect on students life and their future.
To start with, the youth should communicate with the opposite sex since they will not have problems with it in the future. It is a widespread fact that persons who are too shy while studying at university are less likely to become friends with each other and get married. Following that, the division of boys and girls in groups is benefitial to the studying process. For example, a lot of seminar classes are based on pair work and tutors do all their best to form pairs of boys and girls with the aim of their better communication and understanding each other. Finally, as a result of two previous arguments, the relationship between students incide the group will be stronger since they become more able to help, and to respect other students.
However, there can be some problems in such groups. For instance, people believe that only woman can understand another woman. Moreover, boys in the youth are unable to have good relationship with groupmates. espesially with girls.
Taking everything into account, I can say that I am fully agree with the idea of equal number of men and women in the group at university, because it is an experience everyone should get while people are young and study together.
