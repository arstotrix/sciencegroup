The results for career reason slide from 80% according to young people under 26 to 17% according to the elderely, who is over 49. To contrast, interest rise by 49 years old from 10% to 70%. The same results for career and interest are showed in age 40 – 49 and it is 40% of responders. 
As we can see in the second chart, employer support is the most important for young people under 26 years old. Then the results drop to 30% for 30 – 39-years-olds. For the next two groups of people, who is over 49 years old, are less than for 26-29-years-olds.
