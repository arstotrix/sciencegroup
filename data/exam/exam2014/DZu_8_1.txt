The table demonstrates how subway stations in six cities around the world have functioned since their opening. It can be clearly seen that each city has its own characteristics and differs in the opening date, route length and people usage per year.
London’s Railway system is the oldest one, having been developed in 1863 it has the longest route among the other listed cities. The youngest underground system is located in Los Angeles, delivering about 50 million passengers during 1 year, it almost has the shortest route, but the Kyoto one is shorter by 17 kilometres. It also has only 45 million citizens on board per year, which is the smallest number. Tokyo system has the majority of passengers with a number of 1927 million. Paris railway system was opened in the very beginning of 20th century and extends into 199 kilometres, delivering 1191 million people in a year. Washington DCs’ one has only about 144 users with the route of 126 kilometres. 
In conclusion we can see that there is a significant trend of route lengths depending on a year of opening. Also more people tend to use subway in cities where it has been used for a longer time.
