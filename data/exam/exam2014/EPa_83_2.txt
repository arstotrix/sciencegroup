Nowadays our society is concerned by the issue of public health. While some citizens claim that it is necessary to provide more sports facilities, others believe that it is not useful and that we need to solve this problem in an another way.
According to the first point of view we need to expand the variety of sports for the society. It can be achieved by building new sports school or by reducing the price of attending section. The government also can contribute money in new equipment in schools or in the streets. People believe, that in this case sport will be available for all who want to improve their health. 
However, great public heath can be achieves by taking another measures. Firstly, the government can built new hospitals and offer free medical observation, for example, once a year. Secondly, the healthy way of life should be promoted on TV or by the celebrities. It can motivate young people too keep a diet or to go in for sports. The one another option is to around population for their results in improving their health. It can be some competitions with significant prizes. As a rule, people are motivated by desire to win something or to become the first among others. And, of course, we need to prevent air, and water pollution what influence our health a lot.
In conclusion I would like to say that it is not effective to offer some options if people do not want to participate in it. We need to wake their minds and to convince that our health is necessary and that we need to take care of it by ourselves.
