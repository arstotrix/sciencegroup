There is a belief that the each faculty and discipline should be applied by the same number of girls and boys. Personally, I do not agree with this statement due to some reasons.
To begin with, all subjects can be divided into several groups. For instance, there are some math, “exact” disciplines such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, etc. On the other hand, literature, languages and some other subjects are unated into gumanytary sciences. In addition, nowadays there are a lot of creative new subjects, for example, photography, design and so on that studetns can choose. To my mind, the most part of girls and women have a gumanytary state of mind while boys and men are more successful at math and physics.
Undoubtedly, when there is an equal numbers of male and female students in every subject, it gives people a chance to improve their manners and socializing skills. However, as far as I am concerned, one woman understand other woman better than man because of our phsycological and brain. That is why in case of doing some research or discussing topic of the class male and female students can have problems in understanding each other.
Last but not the least argument in order to support my point of view is the question of personal interest of each graduates from school. As for me, I choose some disciplines that give me a chance to improve my professional skills. That is why I prefer to attend Mathematics while other girls in my group choose English or culture.
To sum up, athorities in universities should not form the group of students focusing only in male of the students.
