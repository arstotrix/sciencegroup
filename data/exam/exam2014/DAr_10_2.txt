Nowadays, some people think that if we can build a lot of sport facilities in our cities, public health will be better. But there is another point of view and people believe that it is not a good way to improve public health. The number of children in our centuary is rosed and their parents want to build some sports facilities on their money, because the childâ€™s health is the most important thing for everyone in the world. If children go to the sports in their early years, they can achieve a great result on the Olimpic Games or another completion. Also, sport-gays never smoke or drink alcohol in their life and it is good way to feel better. This arguments suppose that if we have more sports facilities in our cities, our children and public health will be better. But there is an opposite view on this situation. Some people argue that public health is not depended on sports facilities only. They say that in our life we have a lot of disasters and problem with carbon dioxide, which have bad influence for out health. Some food and drinks are break out stomache. For example: fast-food; different food, which consists with E; coca-cola an e.g. The opposite view is that we can change our diet, our life and our views on problem. For example, people can go a walk more than drive a car. This sollution can improve public health and decline the number of carbon dioxide in air. To sum up, in conclusion, I would like to say that I agree with people, who think that if our cities in future will have more sports facilities than now, it will help us to improve our and public health. Of course, our society, nowadays have a lot of problems, which have bad influence for our health. But building new sports stadium only will help us in our life to feel better.
