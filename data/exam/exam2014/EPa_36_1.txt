The carts show the percentage of the populations of Yemen and Italy on the ages between 2000 and 2050. Every chart is devided into three parts: 0 to 14 years period, 15 to 59 year period and the last 60 and more period.
Firstly, lets compare two charts in 2000 year. As we can see the half of the population of Yemen is on 0-14 years people. Almost half (46,3%) is 15 to 59 years old people and only 3,6 per cent of people on 60 and older age: in comparison with Yemen Italy has more population in 60+ years part. But in Italy children 0 to 14 years is much less. 
In the opposite chart there is projections for 2050 of the percentage of population. As it can seem there is a big growth of the population on old age. Hence, the per cant of people from 60+ years part was increased. On the other hand, there is diclining of the population in early ages (0-14).
