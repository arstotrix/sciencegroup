Every person tries to “catch” his or her happiness during the whole life. For the majority of people it’s their goal to feel even once happy and have an apportunity to say it proudly. However, all of them face the problem of defining happiness for themselves. In my point of view, it can be connected with some factors.
Firstly, the world doesn’t stop on one place and the humanity is always in the process of developing and improving – that’s why there is always something new appearing. With it more and more desirable things are included into the list of what can make a person really happy. People’s choice is limitless for this reason, and it is very difficult for them sometimes to choose an appropriate and suitable way to happiness, and this, by turn, can cause mistakes.
Secondly, every person is an individual with his or her own feelings, emotions, knowledge, experience, interests, etc. All these charracteristics in summ form his or her opinion about happiness and what is needed to take it.
Therefore it’s hard to give a definition to your personal happiness taking into account other views.
Thirdly, although it is a controversial point, I tend to think that without finally understanding that you are happy, you can’t say what is happiness for you.
Nevertheless, to percieve yourself as a happy person, you should have a goal you strongly want to succeed, because without it it not possible to continue real life. Moreover, you ought to never give up dealing with difficulties and obstacles to go on finding your happiness.
In conclusion, people’s happiness is an issue under discussion. Its variety of definitions is as wide as the amount of people on the Earth, and often give it prior importance in our lives.
