These four pie charts represent data of age structure of Italy and Yemen populations in 2000 and predictions for 2050. By the beginning of this millenium these countries had relatively different population age structures. An amount of 60+ year old residents was eight times smaller in Yemen rather than in Italy. Unlike Yemen, Italy did not have people younger 14 years as one half of itâ€™s population, their amount was only at the level of about 14%. The difference in 15% may be noted in the number of people aged 15 to 59, where Italy leads. Predictions say, that, by the year 2050, Yemen will go through a slight fluctuations in number of people in generations. Part of young-adults and middle aged residents will increase to 57% along with a growth of an elderly people. In Italy, however, part of residents aged from 15 to 59 will decrease to the level of 46%, giving place for elderly people, whose number will grow by approximately 20%. Overall, we can say that, according to the predictions, there will be more older people in Italy, than in 2000, and the same tendency is seen in Yemen.
