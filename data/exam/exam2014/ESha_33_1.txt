The piecharts below illustrate the ages of people in Yemen an Italy in 2000 and 2050. It is obvious that the second age group (15-59 years) is the largest one in 2050 in both countries. However, the largest age groops in 2000 differ in these two countries. The largest age group in Yemen in 2000 is people from 0 to 14 years, it is about 50%. The situation is completely different in Italy. The group which consist of people from 15 to 59 is the largest there. Another thing that is really important that the amount of old people (60+ years) is really low in Yemen in 2000.


The situation in 2050 in Yemen is not very different from 2000 (3,6% and 5,7% accordingly). Despite of this situation in Yemen, the percentage of old people (60+ years) in Italy is not very small. It is easy to notice that the percentage of old people (60+ years) in Italy in 2050 is almost twice bigger than in 2000 (24,1% and 42,3%). The percentage of kids (0-14 years) is a lot higher in Yemen.


The amount of kids (0-14 yars) in Yemen in 2000 is 4 times bigger than at the same time in Italy. This tendency looks the same in 2050. The percentage of kids (0-14 years) in Yemen is 37%, which is 3 times bigger than in Italy at the same year.
