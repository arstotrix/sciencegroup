The problem of bad public health is actual in modern society. Some people say that in order to improve public health the number of sports facilities should be increased. However, others say that this would have little effect on public health. Personaly I agree with the first point of view, and also propose to add one more way of inproving public health.


According to my mind, increasing the number of sports facilities is the good way of improving public healts. Because each person could fond some activity which is really usefull for him. “As many people – as many minds” - it is the best argument for this position. However, I think that thease way of improving public health should be mixed with social adverticement and TV programs. While siting at home and watching a TV person see the video which contain an information about new facility, it makes him interesting. As a result he dicide to try such kind of facility.


To sum up, nowadays there are a lot of ways of improving.
