The idea of making healthier society is rather widespread. One point of view is to supply people with more opportunities for sport. The opposit argues that something another should be organised.
It is obviously that physical exercises make people more resistable to illness. So, the idea of proving more facilities for this is nice. Firstly, young generation will find sport more interesting than wasting time in front of the monitors. Secondly, number of alcoholics and drug-takers will decrease, because physical activities reduce stress and fill minds with positive thoughts. Thirdly, as a rule, sportmen and sport records are pride of almost every country, and it is easy to predict people`s need to be famous or be just like their own heroes, so, being physically strong is vital in this case.
However, not everyone agrees. There are reasons for throwing the idea away, like social environment. It means that, in fact, people are interested in anyone`s physical power less than in money or status. So, the cult of sport is forever lost. Moreover, sport can not solve the problem of dangerous fumes, acid rains and genetically modified food. That is why government`s attention should be payed to science and developments in pharmacy. 
The situation should be turned to an individual health, to my mind, because society is people. And everyone should improve their own body and mind. From this point of view I support proving more sport opportunities, but science and other methods of improving health should develop, too. Examples, when people wore cured by sport are widespread, but belief in this reduces all the time. 
In conclusion it is important to underline that the question is very sophisticated. Arguing sides must not separate from each other, but come together and make a common decision. Surely, sport can not solve the problem alone, so other possible variant must be taken into consideration.
