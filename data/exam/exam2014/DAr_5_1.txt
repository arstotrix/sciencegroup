All pie charts show the data about the amount of people of different ages in Yemen and Italy. All the figuires contain different percentages. As for Yemen, it is clearly noticed that half of all population is children from 0 to 14 years old in 2000. To compare with projections for 2050 it is obvious that the amount of children will dramaticly reduce. However, the population of middle-ages will increase to 57,3 percent. In differ from the situation in Yemen, the biggest part of population in Italy is middle-ages people in 2000. But young inhabitants take only 14,3 percent. However, the elder population is more than Yemenâ€™s one in 8 times. As for future situation, it is illustrated that the amount of middle-ages people will sharply fall down to 46,2 percent. But children population will strongly increase. To compare with projections of Yemen for 2050 the most noticable change is the change of the youngest population: 11,5 percent in Italy and 37 percent in Yemen. In conclusion, it is should be said that indicators are very different in the all pie charts and rates of 2000 reflect other meanings than the same rates in 2050.
