Nowadays, a lot of people agree that universities should give similar amount of places for male and female and offer equal rules. I agree with this statement because modern society achieves equal position for gender and people should forget about sexism.
First of all, studying males and femalle together helps to develop communication skills and make people open- minded and friendly. A student group consists of only girls, atmosphere becomes stressful which lead to bad marks. For example, my class at school accounts for 20 girls therefore there were gossips and shouts.
The next vital argument necessity of avoiding differences between men and women. A few decades ago, society faced to feminism which lead to various problems. Today, universities are open for everybody and it's wrong to give dishonest conditions for different gender groups.
On the other hand, some of people consider that education isn't essential thing for women because the can't spend time in the wrong way and avoid of making a family and bringing - up children. 
Based on different arguments, my opinion is that universities should give opportunities for both males and females and as out-of the day to distinguish gender aspects.
