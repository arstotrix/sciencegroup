Many years ago government could punish some creative people when their ideas did not support power's way of managerment. Today artists have the freedom, but sometimes government can restrict their ideas. I am convinced that creative artists should not be restricted.
In my opinion, politics and art do not have the same reasons. The function of government is regulation of social, economical and political relationships in society. Art is another world that gives up an opportunity to think and live as we wish in our fantasies.
If creative persons forget their freedom to express their ideas, we will not see the new kinds and trends of art. Modern life is very dynamic, it changes very fast. Yes, we have many wonderful pictures of 18 century, we can listen to classical music and watch old films. But, despite of it, we need more genius compositions.
We know that some of modern songs, films, cartoons and pictures have the signals of revolution. Power afraid of this trend, because modern art can influence the society more then government. Without any doubt, sometimes it can be useful. Power corrupts. Art is indicator of people's opinion, and people can influence government.
Freedom is a criteria of democracy. Democracy is the main idea of modern life, that is why today everybody can express his ideas the way he wants.
But some people have an opposite viewpoint. They sure that modern painters and singers are very free, that is why their expression is ugly and can influence children and polite people bad way. I think that these people are afraid of changes in modern world.
Art is long, life is short, that is why freedom should be the main criteria of modern art, because we need the new ways of expression.
