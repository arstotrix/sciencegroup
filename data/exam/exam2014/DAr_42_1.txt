As for old population, which was initially only 3,6 percent in 2010 in Yemen, it is expected  to rise a little bit for 2,1 percent by 2050. According to predictions, the percent of people over 60 is going to go up in Italy too, but in contrast this percentage is much higher that in Yemen and will increase considerable from 24,1 to 42,3 percent. What is more, the rate of children from 0 to 14 years old will fall in 2050 by 13 percent to 37 points, initially reaching exactly half of Yemen population.
