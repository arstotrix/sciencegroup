Every person wants to be happy. It is very relevant feeling for our society. However, nobody knows what is happiness and how to become happy.
The issue of happiness has been analyzing by many philosophs, socyologists bad psychologists. According to their research all people have their own understandings of happiness, which were influenced by their education, the perception of the world and cultural background. What is more, the relationships between the members of the family where the person was grown up, play a great role in the determing of this subject.
There are a lot of points which are concerned with the topic of hapiness. First, I would like to outline that we can not be happy without close people who can support us in the difficult period of our life and help us to overcome troubles. They can be our friends, family, parents, but, without any doubts, it is necessary to have such people by our side.
Second, to achieve finacial aspect should not be the main goal of our life, nevertheless, without certain level of prosperity we can not afford to have the life which is illustrated in mass media because of the development of the consumer society. Feeling of unsuccess can influence on our minds and disturb us from the enjoing of our life. I want to add that travellings that give us new impressions and good education can not happen without money.
What matters most in this case that the person feel comfortable and appcacemental only in a good political and economic situation in the world. We can not achieve the enough level of happiness totalitarial society where it is forbidden to express our thoughts and feelings. We also want to discover our potential and become development person.
To conclude, I would like to emphasize that happiness depends on many points and each person shoul follow his own guideline for achieving it.
