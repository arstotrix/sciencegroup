For the last decades modern society has changed significantly. For example, public health becomes worse everyday, but what should be done to improve it? People believe that sport facilities can have a huge impact on public health improvement, but others think that there are other ways to make public healthier. In the following paragraphs it will be presented both points of view on this problem.


Firstly, many people should do different physical exercises which were recomended by their doctor,  but some of them can not afford to do it because they have no sport facilities near their home. For example, my grandfather had problems with backbone and he had to do exercises in special sport centers, but it was too problematic to go there through all the town. Secondly, when more sport facilities are offered to young people, they will pay more attention for sport activities than for drugs and alcohol.


Also there are other ways to improve public health. First of them is to develop moder technologies in a medicine. Besides, government could make a free medical services for all citizens.


From my point of view, increasing the number of sport facilities is one of the best ways to make public healthier but it should associated with qualified medical service.


In conclusion, it should be said that there are many ways to make public healthier but people should not concentrate only on one of them.
