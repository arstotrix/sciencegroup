The diagrams given represent the information on actual and predicted population of two countries. As an overall trend we can notice that the population of 60+years olds will change in negligible margin in 50 years period in Yemen as well as 0-14 years olds in Italy.
Concidering changes in medium-ages residents we can note that in Yemen it is predicted to go up while italian 15-59 year olds are forecasted to reduce in quality. However, there is an equal trend in both nationalities that older population will approximately double in 50 years. Furthermore, this period projected to leave both countries with less children (a 20% reduction in Yemen and 2% in Italy). It is also noticeable that the majority of residents will be represented by people of working age in both countries.
To summarise the facts described, we can conclude that even if there are some changes to be faced, the general picture will not change dramatically.
