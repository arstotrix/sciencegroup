These days there are many creative artists in different areas such literature, painting and drawing, music and cinema. They have a lot of interesting ideas to make true in life and some people consider that there should be no limits by government on what they create. I can not completely agree with this statement. On the one hand, if artists do new projects, we can get wonderfull pieces of art which will value around the world. For example, like it was in the past, many well-known artists such Leonardo Da Vinci has painted a lot of beautiful canvases and now we are very proud of him and his paintings.
	On the other hand, there are some artists which do not know any limits in their creativity. Every crazy idea in their head become popular among people and affect them a lot. For example, one conteporary artist made an exhibition starring a homeless dog, which he leaves to die there. So this kind of projects should be restricted by government or other specific organisations.
	To conclude, I must say that everything that artist do should have a measure and be controlled, because otherwise humanity will be influensed by crazy people and will not progress.
