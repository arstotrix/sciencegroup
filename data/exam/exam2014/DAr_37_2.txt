Some people think we have to take care about our health. Other think that it isn’t so important and if you waste a lot of time in sport centers you will not like more years. On the one hand, of course, we must be careful with our body and health. Easy execises as morning running can help to feel you better. If you want to have a clean skink you will have to see what you eat. On the other hand, some people drink alcohol and smoke a lot, but they live for a long time. Not everyone who has bed habits live for 60 or more years, of course. But every day we hear about people with different died illness. Sometimes these people take care a lot about themselves: do sports, don’t eat meat, go camping and a lot of others, but die young. Do we have to take care? Or we should do what we want? To my mind, we should do morning exercises, try to help other people, eat healthy food. But sometimes can eat unhealthy products: crisps, cola, dishes with salt and papper.  If our body want something we should eat or do it. At the same time everybody has some barries, for instance, understand that drugs is very bad but several times in a month you can drink a little alcohol. In my opinion every of us must do all that he or she want to to, but somethings enough to do once in a life. To sum up, how someone said, in healthy body live healthy soul.
