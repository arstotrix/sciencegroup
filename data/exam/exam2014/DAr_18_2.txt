These are many views on how to make our population healthier. Some people see sports as the best option, but many disagree. Let us look closer at this issue. To my mind, providing publicity with affordable sports facilities is a great way to improve physical and, at some point, phychological condition of many people. Doing sports develops your skills, mind and helps to entertain yourself in a healthy manner. There is no lack in evidence of people who are living a happy life doing any kind of sport, from table tennis to parachuting, and who have no health issues. However, many people are not so optimistic about sports. They believe, that these are other factors which help us to stay fit and healthy and say, that some sports (like extreme sports), may be dangerous for your well-being. They consider healthy nutrition, clean ecology, good conditions of living and lack of stresses to be more important and influencing factors. But all of those are controlled by the person him or herself, whereas increasing the number of sports facilities, available for big amounts of people, are the measures, which may be implemented by the governments. So, those, who are willing to try different sports and improve his or her physical-being, can do it and others can turn to the extra ways of staying wealthy. To sum up, I must admit, that it is a personal choice of everybody on how to treat his or her health, but I see doing sports as the essential point of staying in a good fit and mood.
