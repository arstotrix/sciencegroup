It is a debating question whether we inherit our traits of character from our ancestors or they form under the life circumstances which are unique for each person. To my mind, there is no way against nature as the information about every human is coded deeply inside his genes.
Biotechnology and genetic engineering have proved that the genes are allocated apriori, even before a human is born to the world. We are a reflection of our parents to some extent as we gain from them is evenly divided between the mother and the father. It is also important not to put out of account that physical characteristics such as height, weight and the body complection can be predicted in the early childhood with high accuracy.
Moreover, as children grow up they start close relationship and make friend with others. It contributes to better understanding of the fact nobody can be the same. Teens make an adjustment to their behaviour in order to match the expectations of other people and to respect different points of view. It means that cooperating with others shapes our mind in a particular way or flows our thoughts in various ways. Yet, the inner features that distinguish us from anyone else can be founded long before the birth.
To sum up, I strongly believe humanâ€™s personality is defined by the genetic program that makes everyone not alike. However, some traits of character can be diminished or developed in some way.
