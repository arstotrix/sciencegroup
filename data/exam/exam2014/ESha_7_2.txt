Some of creative artists feel pressure from government and society, so they can't do new things and go to the main aim of their live.


Some people think what we must give freedom for artists. It doesn't matter famous he or not, may be it is just a street artist, may be a singer, or he draw pictures. The positive moment of freedom for artists is that they can show us their expressions and their art, and it is available to discuss and have a feeling of somethings new, strange or beautifull for all people who need it. You can just go to the centre of your city in some weekend or holidays and you will see a lot of amazing artist wich are just staying in the streets and show their art. A lot of people love it because they don't pay for it, you can go with your girlfriend through the park and hear beautiful sounds of violy. 


On the other hand, what if the art is ugly? What if some people don't want to see it, they can be even stressed of some sort of art. One day I have seen the video on Youtube, in channel “Steve kardynal”. In these video the artist was dancing at the streets in New York and was dressed very strange. Young people can understand it and just have fun, they are smiling and take some pictures. But old people can't understand some jokes. That can be harmfull for their feelings.
