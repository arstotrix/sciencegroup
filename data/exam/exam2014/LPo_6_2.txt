Nowadays, both, girls and boys study in the universities all over the world. Girls often attend classes, which are better for boys and boys sometimes choose classes, which are more useful for girls. And it looks strange, when girls study engeneering and boys studing classic literature or art history. But what about universities? Should they accept equal numbers of male and female students for every subjects or not?
I think, that girls are girls and boys are boys anyway. It does not look normal, when there are more girls than boys in technical classes. And it is not good, when there are only boys in art history classes. And university can accept equal numbers of girls and boys to this subjects to demand this problem. Personaly I thik there is no serious problems with classes. If person like something more, than another, he shouls attend, what he likes. Universitites can’t choose, what to study and how to live, they only provide and organise education for students.
Also, I think, that sometimes girls are really good in technical subjects, like chemistry, math, engennering and others. And there are famous poets, writers and artists between men. So, It can be unfair not to accept someone only because of his sex.
In conclusion, universities can’t make such decision. We live in democratic country and we can choose, where and what to study be ourself. Nobody can make a decision for you. Parents and university can only give an advise. But everybody must be able to choose their future themself.
