Nowadays school administrations all over the world face lots of troubles with student behaviour again and again. These troubles are different and they appear approximately everyday. The best way to solve the problem is to investigate the cause of the problem and then find some ways of the solution.

In my opinion there are two main causes of these problem and they are very complicated. The first cause is obviously a family, the behaviour of the child depends on a situation in family. If a person grows up in a good conditions with care and love, the person will behave adequatelly. Another important thing is the explanation about good and bad things to a child. And if the person grows up in the conditions of eternal argues, offending words and without wise teachings, the person’s behaviour will be too bad. I grew up at the outskirts of the city, so I studied at school with a lot of children, who had some problems in family.

The second problem is the lack of discipline at school. Discipline goes from a family, but it can be changed at school. Nowadays the problems with discipline are at least everywhere and teachers don’t know how to improve the poor situation. It is really difficult but possible to make discipline better.

The situation in family can’t be changed somehow at all, because it goes from father to son with methods and traditions. So if the family is good, it will be good all the time and if it is bad, it will always be bad. But the situation with lack of discipline can be changed with a lot of ways. The best one is punishment. Schools should be able to have a permission to punish their students for bad behaviour and after few punishments a student undoubtely will understand the things he did wrong.

To sum up I want to say that the problem with student behaviour is very important and complicated and some ways to solve this problem must be found as soon as possible.
