Nowadays lots of people in modern society suppose that creative artists should be given the freedom of expressing their own opinion and ideas by in any way they like. It may seem there are really only attractive features in this, but it should be noticed that the situation should also be under the government control at least a little.
	Firstly, the freedom of creative people can be even dangerous for the whole society and now, when the situation and relations between people is so changeable, it can bring lots of problems. As an example, it’s possible to say about serious examples of unexpectable behave of creative people and even the danger of it. Moreover, it should be discussed the as one of the reason for doubt – differerent preferences of creative people in modern society. It can create many new problems in society too.
	On the other hand, it could be argued that there in the fact, that creative people can add in modern society interesting and new ideas for the benefit of all. But it should be under the strict control of government without any doubts.
	All the things considered, I would like to conclude that it should be discussed in society
