Nowadays we can see a lot of artists, on TV, in theatres, cinemas or internet. But we can see a lot of censuras too. Some people think that government shouldn't disturb to artists deals. Other think that a lot of freedom in their expressing of feels are very dangerous. Who is right? As for me, I am for freedom to express their ideas. 
And now I want to prove my point of view. Firstly, if government inclkudes some restriction for artists in law, we will see a lot of agressive feelings and emotions from their side. Moreover, it can hurt to world's culture. Secondly internet becomes very pooular nowadays and any artist can loud their creation in this global network. So government wil not disturb to  it. Thirdly, artists show us other worlds, romantic stories, beautiful landscapes, which we can not see around us. And I think it is great. 
But there is another point of view. Some people are absolutely sure that freedom in different arts is very dangerous. They believe that music and films often hurt to children's mind and change it for their ideology. So government don't allow to appear on TV and internet a lot of dangerous product of arts and these people think that it is right. I don't agree with them. People have right to see all they want and government must not do any restrictions on it. 
In conclusion I would like to stress that I am for freedom to express artists own ideas.  But these problem is very difficult and needs further discussion. How many people so many opinion and everyone chooses for himself.
