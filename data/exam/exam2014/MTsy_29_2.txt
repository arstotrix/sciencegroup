There is a discussion between people, who think that people' health will be better after building new sports facilities and people, who think it does not connect with health of population.
First position means, that goverment and business should invest more money in sport, build new sport centers in cities, develope different competitions in each kind of sport. For their meaning; it would increase people interest in sports, give them opportunities to do sport. All this points should increase in general health of population. This position can be true, because sport really improve personal health and also save people from smoking, drinking and using drugs.
But on the other hand increasing of number of sport facilities may do not improve people's health. If sport sections will cost too much, usual people could not join them. Also, sport facilities can be use for sport shows by businesmen. It is good point, but really it will not increase people health. Another point for this position, that sport is not main part of health. Money, which also should be invested in medcine, health care, but not only in sport.
To conclude, building of sport facilities is a good term for populating sport. But it is not the only part of health programe. The goverment should only increase the level of health care, struggle with bad habbits of population and so on. If to do this all together, people health will be increased after some period of time.
