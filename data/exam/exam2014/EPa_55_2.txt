Nowadays world is becoming less and less helthier in comparison with 50 or even 20 years ago. They say, we should increase the number of sports facilities to improve our health. I believe, it wouldn`t have very large effect on our health. 
On the one hand, definitely this measures are required by society. Firstly, doing cardio exersizes, people will make their hearts stronger and decrease the number of heart deseases. Also, people will have more activities in their lives, because today we just go to work or study and back. Eventually, doing different exersizes, we will have more muscles and our bones will be broken less.
On the other hand, only increasing gyms and other sports facilities will not help society to make public helth better. To begin with, very few people will use new sports classes or something else. We are too busy to have enough time and spend it on sport. Moreover, today people have a lot of inborn illnesses, so sport cannot help them. Our society just has to improve hospital equipment to have more effect on public health. And finally, today`s ecology situation is the worst in the history of the Earth, so different gases, air pollution and other damaging processes will stay even if we increase the number of sport facilities. We should better improve our cleansing equipment and other. 
To sum up, sport facilities will help to improve public health in different ways in different societies. But if problem is not in peoples` activity or strength of their heart or something like this, sport will not help them and other measures are required.
