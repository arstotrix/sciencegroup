There is an idea that increasing the number of sport facilities will improve public health in the best way. I strongly believe that this statement is true. If all people will have an opportunity to use some sport facilities in their local area and do it cheaply of for free almost every one will do some sport activities at least once a week and improve their health. Firstly, increasing of the number of sport facilities will give people an opportunity to visit gym of some sport section near their home. There is a big poblem that people can not do sports because of distance to sport facilities, especially in small towns. For example, many children and teenagers use to do sports in governmental sport centres in their local area because it is near their home and free. Secondly, increasing of the number of sport facilities will give people a chance to choose any kind of sports they like. Many people avoid doing sports because they can not find sport activities according to their phisical features and tastes. Also many people do not doing sports because of big number of people in sport facilities in their town. Increasing the number of sport facilities and building big sport centres with many kinds of sports will solve the problem. For example, such sport centres are very popular in big cities where it is very difficult to find good sport facilitie. Finally, increasing the number of sport facilities is really very good way to improve public health by increasing of number of people doing sports. There is many advantages of such idea and I think that government will play a very big role in increasing of the number of sport facilities.
