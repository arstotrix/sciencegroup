Nowadays many stadiums are built and people are encouraged going into sports. Some people belive that these facilities and opportunities are vitaly important for our health. However, it is not enough for some reasons.
I am strongly concerned that new stadiums, developing sport activities, promotion of extraordinary kinds of sport are the golden opportunity for every person on the planet. To be perfectly  honest, each day we spend a lot of time setting (in front of the computer, at school, at university and so on) and by the end of the day the majority of us have the terrible back-ache or head-ache. To overwhelm the pain it is good to do some sport or to run a circle at the stadium. It is a well-known fact, that every activity helps to change the mood.
From the other point of view, not every person likes training or is keen on sport. For those people there are alternatives. For example, modern medical service, green parks in the city, fresh air. To speak the truth, sometimes the lack of basic medicine is the key problem. In this way, there is no activity that would help you.
I suppose, that it is possible to come across many diseases if you take care of your body. Every body deserves to be active, strong, healthy and bring only happiness and positive effects for his owner and person himself.
In the conclusion, I would like to say, that public health of the country and of the world is in the hands of each person. And only together, encouraging each other, we can make our world our world healthier!
