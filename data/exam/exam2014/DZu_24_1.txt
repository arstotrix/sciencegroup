The table on the previous page demonstrates features of underground railway system in six different cities. We can see three parametres: date of opening, kilometres of route and passangers per one year (in millions people). So, letâ€™s analyze them.
Firstly, I want to analyze date of opening. The oldest underground railway system is in London, it was opened in IXX century, in 1863. What about the newest underground railway system from our six cities, it is located in Los Angeles and was opened in XXI century, in 2001. It is the only URS (underground railway system) from our table that was opened in XXI century. Other Underground railway system I want to write in order of date opened: Paris, Tokyo, Washington DC and Kyoto URS, so they were opened in 1900. 1927, 1976 and finally 1981. Now about kilometres of route. The smallest and shortest URS is situated in Kyoto, Japan with nearly 11 kilometres of route. The biggest and the longest URS is in London with 394 kilometres of route. Other URS I will write in order of biggering: Los Angeles, Washington, Tokyo and Paris with 11, 126, 155 and 199 kilometres of route. It is interesting that older URS is longer. However, there is an exception: LA URS is longer than Kyoto URS despite the fact that LA URS is younger than Kyoto URS.  
Finally I will analyze passangers per year (in millions). The biggest number of passangers per year is in Tokyo with 1927 millions people per year. The lest number is in the shortest URS, in Kyoto, with 45 millions per year. Other numbers are: 50, 144, 775 and 1191 millions per year in LA, Washington DC, London and Paris.
