The table below shows different working sectors in the UK in 1998 and 2006 and their popularity then and now between different age groups.
The first sector, hotel & catering, shows that this industry was mostly chosen by people of 26-35 and 36-45 age groups in 2006 though in 1998 it was more popular between younger ages (18-23). Building business was and and still  is most popular in 18-25 age group (ex. 112565 vs. 5400 people in senior 56-65 age group). The results of technology industry are probably the most fascinating: this industry rose up by several times between 1998 and 2006 in all of the groups and by 2006 it made technology the most popular business to choose as a job. Education, the last sector, shows pretty the same results: it was the most popular between 26-35, 36-45 and 46-55 age groups and by 2006 those statistics havenâ€™t changed. This is the least popular sector between young (18-25) group sector but the second popular at all after technology.
