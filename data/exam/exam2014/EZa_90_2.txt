There are a lot of talented people around the world. They all want to show the society their ideas, but sometimes government don't let them do it. This is a great problem for artists and this situation is need to be discussed.

On the one hand, there are a lot of music clips that are dangerous for ill people. For example, the clip "All of the lights" made by Kanye West consists of flashing lights. These lights can call epyleptics to pations who were calm for years.

In 2002 the film "Wedding jar" was shown to society. It consists of different types of violent scenes. Governments of all countries restricted to watch it. However, the producer of this film gained popularity and got it's own fans. 

On the other hand, the government of Russia fixed the age line on some old cartoons. People were shocked by such news, because they grew up with such cartoons and decided that it is normal to show them to their children. The authors were shocked too because they got a lot of prices during their life for their ideas. 

In 1940 the book "Shatuny" was restricted to be published in Russia. This book tells us the story of a crazy killer. A lot of people were killed by such crazy people in 1980-1990. If people read such book they will know how to save their lives and prevent the danger. Mamleev gained popularity only in the 21 century, because it became easier to get the information from the internet. 

There are two different positions on this case. Some ideas should be shown to society some should not. However, if someone wants to learn the idea or the information he will get it and there are no regrets to the internet and to people's possibilities.
