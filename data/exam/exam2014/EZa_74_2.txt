Nowadays we can see that many popular people have some freedom, which other people don't have: they can speak what they want, do what they want, take what they want not punished by government when stars not follow the laws.
It is clear that government should restrict some artist's doings. If artist will continue use their enormous freedom, whole world will go to chaos and darkness. We can look at the last news: one popular painter Benksy sprayed his graffiti on the cultural heritage. As I think, it is not good doing. If painter wants to become more popular, he can make pictures on walls,concretes, asfalt on streen but he cant damage memorials. 
Of course, creative artists can use their freedom on good doings: for example they can collect some charities, use their popularity on support medical corporations, to prevent serious illneses. If some popoular man or woman made brilliant speech on TV, but this monologue was not correct politically it was the great idea to express their emotions and doings. Sometime, we can break some rules if we know that our planet will receive much more profit in future. 
As I think, government should make some low restrictions which permits ilegal actions in some cases of life, but we cant permit all of doings. Freedom in words, in pictures, in music and films is one of the most significant freedom of people. 
To sum up,  creative artist not always should be given the freedom to express their iudeas but in some cases they can do something wrong and illegal. Each case is different and we cant speak about all thinks same.
