The chart illustrates the difference of levels of post-school qualifications in Australia between men and women who held them in 1999. It consists of five positions: skilled vocational diploma, undergraduate diploma, Bachelor's degree, postgraduate diploma and Master's degree.
The difference between men and women who got skilled vocational diploma is substancial. There were for about 90% of men and only 10% of women of that level of post-school qualification. However, there were 70 per cent of women against 30 per cent of men who had undergraduate diploma. The level of Bachelor's degree was practically the same:  55% of women and 45% of men, whereas level of postgraduate diploma was different: 70 per cent of men and only 30 per cent of women. The last position, which is shown in the graph, is Master's degree. The level of women who got that degree is lower than the level of men and it is 40%.
To sum up, the differences in post- school qualifications according to gender are serious enough, that is why it is hard to headline the whole trend of the graph.
