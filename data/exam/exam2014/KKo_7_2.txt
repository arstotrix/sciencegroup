Condition of public health is one of the most discussed problems. There are some suggestions of the ways of its improving, and one of them is increasing the number of sport facilities. However, there are some doubts that this would actually work.
On the one hand, there are a lot of advantages of developing sport facilities. Unfortunately, a lot of citizens can hardly find a football or basketball pitch in their neighbourhood. That leads to unnecessary wasting of time on the way to sport facilities that could even prevent people from visiting them. And increasing the number of these facilities would solve this problem. What is more, some people who were not interested in  sports earlier may find doing sports really attractive for them in case of sports facilities growing number.
On the other hand, there are some disadvantages of this solution too. There are no proovs that the construction of new sports facilities would influence people interests. Some people might be bored of all kinds of sports and prefer another ways of spending time. Some people may also disagree with spreading of sport fields because they may need other kinds of facilities. For instance, families with children may worry about the replacement of playgrounds or parks with sports constructions. But this position is arguable because different sports facilities are well-combined within parks or with playgrounds.
To sum it up, there are a lot of pros and cons for building more sports facilities. The main evidence for this solution is the lack of sports constructions and people are not able to do sports. But there are some doubts that this would not only influence public health in a good way, or even may spoil already existing facilities. However, these concerns are not actually truthful and increasing number of sport fields and other constructions would only change the situation in a better way.
