In our rapidly changing world, modern people often forget about their health and sport activities. And more and more people believe that the best way to improve public health is by increasing the number of sports facilities or some other methods. On the one hand, a lot of cities canâ€™t provide enough sports facilities for citizens to keep fit and to make themsefs healthier. And of course, it would be better to increase the number of such facilities. Moreover, it may attract people to live in such city and not to move to another one. Other people believe, that increasing the number of sports facilities is not productive solution of the problem of health. It is supposed that providing a good medical aid, healthy food and decreasing the air and water polution is more important then sport facilities. And government should pay attention to these factors. According to my own opinion, to improve public health government should make a special programes, which include increasing sport facities, providing healthy food and medical help, and making popular healthy way of life. For example, in my country, literature, massmedia provides a lot of information to make our life healthier. To conclude, I can say that all of methods to improve public health are useful and productive, the problem often is not how to investigate new way, but how to realize the hole plan of improving public health.
