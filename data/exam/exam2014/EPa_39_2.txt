Nowadays, with so many enviromental problems and polution people need to improve their degree of health. There are many discussions about the way of lifes and the way of health`s upgrading. So thus, the question “what is the best way to improve public health?” arise.
Undoubtedly, the growth of quantity of sports centers will be very acceptable. I could say that in modern world the importance of sports activities has an upward trend. People are interested in their body, figure and of course their health. For this aim big and medium-sized cities have a huge range of sports clubs. For example, government also maintain the sports programmes such as encouraging of Olimpic winners.
On the other hand there are a significant number of different measures which are needed to improve public health. For example, it would be a great idea about restriction of producing carbohydrats products. Also, the offering of fast-food restaurants will be declined because it leads to overweighting of population. Anothe way of improving health is using of ecological transport like a bicycle. Therefore, rhe environment would be a little better. And I think that a stress situation has a bad influence on people`s health. But it would be improved only by personal introspection. 
All in all, I`m totally agree that introducing of sporst facilities will increase a level of population`s health, but also if people will be combine a sport lifestyle with healthy food it would have a huge effect on the main target as a public health.
