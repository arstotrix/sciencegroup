In it isn’t a common thing to have an equal number of male and female students in every subject. It is supposed to be explained, however, I’m totally agree that it would be properlier to have an equal amount of students of opposite sex.
The point is that most of the young men are more fond of technical thinking and, on the other hand, there are young women, who most probably prefer literature and cinema to constructing planes or building fabrics. For instance, I’m studying philology and languages in my university. On our couse we have 40 students, but there are only thee males. In some subjects there are no them at all, just because they decided not to choose it. Obviously, it isn’t right, because university/school aren’t only places for studying, but also for communicating, for development the ability of building relationships.
To continue my thought, I’ll make some more arguments. So, the equal amount of males and females helps to maintain the harmony of those two beginnings. These both types of conciousness are working better, the male’s part is more rational, the female’s is more creative. It’s necessary to do some groupworks using their rationality and creativity, despite the possible arguing. It’s important to integrate men’s interests in women’s heads, at least just learn them how to contact each other. Men and women are obliged to comprehend themselves and, in my opinion, they have to start doing it yet in university.
To conclude, I’d like to add that we need to solve the problem of the equality in Russia. People on their works usually discuss something or have an argues, however, the only thing they need to be learned is tolerance and comprehension.
