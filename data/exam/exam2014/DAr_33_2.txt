Many people believe that the best way to improve health conditions is by rising the number of sport facilities. However, other people say that many other measures will be more effective. In my opinion the public  health could be improved by combining differents ways. First of all, the goverment should increase the number of sport facilities, for example, build new gym centres in schools and universities or create some new sport competitions for all family. Seconly, the goverment should ban cars from city centre. This option will not only help to save the historical heritage of city, but also prevent people from breathing dangerous gases. Furthermore, it is also very important to decrease the number of industrial and domestic wastes which are poured into our rivers and seas. As a result of water pollution all people especially children who swim a lot in our lakes have serious health problems. Another  measure which will help improve public health is the fight with smoking and alcohol drinking. I strongly believe that smoking shouldn’t be allowed in all public places, especially restaurants and cafes where there are a lot of people with children. It is also necessary to add in school timetable a special subject where children will be told about the dangerous effect of cigaret which tell youngsters about terrible consiquances of drinking alcohol, smoking and taking drugs. All in all, I’d like to say that not only the increasing the number of sports facilities will help to improve public health, but the combination of different factors will make our nation much more healthier.
