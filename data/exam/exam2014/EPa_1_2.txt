It is controversal question nowadays, that increasing number of sport facilities is the best way for improving public health 
From the one hand, giving new opportunities for people to do sport, such as building cheap sport centres, setting free sport equipment on the stadiums and in the schools, organisation of free sport clubs for children and so on, may improve population`s attitude to this. This measures allow poor families to visit sport centres, show people that sport is available for them, attract children`s attention to the health way of life.
From the other hand, even thought there are will be more sports facilities, it is necessary to explain people why sport is important, also to represent them the utility of it. The most important factor of improving public health is people`s desire to do sport. Such measures as translation of sport programmes for children, grate sport events like Olympic Games will inspire people to lead health way of living. Also the big mention has a part of sport activity in education programme. Children should be involved in sport since young age.
To sum up, I think that, creating of new sport facilities should be with the inspiring nation to be health and to do sports, simultaneously. Making of possibilities and creation of insentives are the main things for success in direction of improving public health.
