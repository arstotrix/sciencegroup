It is argued that consuming sports-related content is not beneficial. Whether it's watching sport match on TV or going to a live event, some people are convinced that it doesn't make any sense to devote so much time and energy to something so trivial as sport. In this essay I will try to support this idea by providing my own opinion on this matter.
First and foremost, rooting for your favorite team can result in violence. A lot of sports fans feel so involved with the game that if their favorite team gets knocked out, it aggravates them so much that they cause disturbance to other people. The prime example would be the numerous fan fights that occured during the World Cup.
Secondly, being just a fan and not actually doing sports is a waste of time. Instead of sitting on the couch and whining about how the players perform, it would more beneficial to your health, both mental and physical, to go out and excersise. For instance, it has been proven by various studies that most sports fans don't work out themselves.
But nevertheless, some people claim that being a sports fans and rooting for your country during world championships bring the country together. But I believe that this is not true as most of the time it only fosters animocity between countries.
Take the Olympics for example, many countries get banned from participating in the games, which leads to conflicts.
To sum up, it's evident that the disadvantages of watching sports outweigh the advantages. Therefore, it's clear that it's a waste of time.
