Nowadays everything change with extremely speed. Technology do not stay at the same place too. People can’t even imagen their lives without computers, telephones, television, But sometimes things which seem to us good, can cause many problems with our health.

In my opinion, we should start speak about mobily telephones. Today our telephone is not only a thing to speak and contact to each other, but now mobile is our book, our game, our photo-camera and many other things. There are people who can’t even stay one hour without his/her mobile. Then they get up, they check the mobile, they read while eating. I think that modern mobile phones is an absolut bomba of very very slowly moving. Firstly we all know about radiation from all our devices. Secondly, seeting for ten to forty hours a day watching at a small screen can cause great problems with your yes. 

Another technology linked with smoking are ‘vapes’. During two years million of people botight this electron cigarette, saying that this new technology will help them to stop smoking tobacco. The problem is that nobody even think about the consisting of this vapes. Not only adult, but teenagers too smoke this electron cigarette during all day, thinking that a hundred of different peroxids will not destroy their body. Smoking is a legalized drug, by electron ciggarets are drugs being pack in a very beautiful box.

In conclusion I would like to say that the problem of our world, our decade and new technologies consist of the fact, that people buy all this new things and start to use them like absolutely crazy men. All that was made with unnatural goods should be explored by us carefully.
