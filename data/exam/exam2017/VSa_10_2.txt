It is widely accepted that advances in the new technologies benefit a lot to the life of people. At the same time, there are individuals arguing that the scientific achievments can bring serious health problems to people, who use it. Personally, i believe that attentive and accurate use of such technologies can improve people's lives.
Firstly, I would like to point, that such problems, that are mentioned in the previous paragraph, are connected not only with the advances in science, but with the way of people's lives, that is affected by these changes. For instance, the widespread acess to the Internet and Videogames tend some individuals to become lazy and passive which leads to the heart diseases and problems with spine.
Secondly, mentioned achievments in sciences and development of the IT causes another kind of problem, connected mostly with the psychological changes in people's lives. For example, those who spend a great deal of time in the Web, may find themselves annoyed with loneliness and distracted from the real world.
However, there are some ways to the solution of these problems. If we are speaking about the negative effect on physical fitness of the people, I should say that children, who are mostly affected by these changes, could be restricted in the acess of such ways of entertainment by their parents. Then, speaking about the psychological changes, it's up to people's surroundings to engage such individuals in offline activities and distract them from depression, caused by loneliness. Moreover, this must followed by some govern mental efforts in order to involve people in some healthy activities.
All in all, the advances in technology give us a good chance to improve our live conditions, but people should not rely on them, paying no attention to the development of themselves.
