The given bar chart illustrates the average period of time which people in England could spend on some sport activities. There are separated data for each age and gender.
Overall, it is clear that men usually spend more time on exercises than women do. The most significant difference took place for ages 16 to 24: men did sports prasctically three times more often than women do. However, the difference between sexes tended to disappear with the old age: men and women at the age of 55 to 64 spent approximately the same period of time on sport.
Older people tended to spend less time on exercises. For example, young men spent approximately 282 minutes on sport, while those who were over 75 years old spent only 29 minutes. The men at the age of 25 to 34 spent significantly less time on sport activities than men at the age of 16 to 24. On the other hand, the difference between women of that ages was not so big.
