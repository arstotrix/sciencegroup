NOWADAYS THE MODERN SOCIETY IS FACING A LOT OF PROBLEMS. hOWEVER, ONE THE MOST CONTROVERCIAL AND ARGUED QUESTION IS THE PROBLEM OF CRIMES COMMITED BY YOUNG PEOPLE. GOVERMENT AND PARENTS TRY TO COME UP WITH AN EFFICIENT SOLUTION AND PREVENT CRIMES AND DECREASE THEIR LEVEL TO THE MINIMUM, BUT THE BEST WAY WAS NOT FOUND YET. THIS ESSAY TRIES TO FIND OUT THE SOLUTION AND UNCOVER THE TRUE CAUSES OF THIS SITUATION IN TODAYS WORLD.

FIRST OF ALL, CHILDREN ARE AFFECTED BY VIOLENCE SHOWN IN TV SERIAS OR FILMS, THEY ARE EASILY INFLUNCED BY CHARISMATIC VILLIANS AND TRY TO MIMIC THEM. THE STATISTICS TELLS THAT MORE THAN 50 PER CENT OF CRIMES IS COMMITED JUST BECAUSE OF THE DESIRE TO FEEL SOMETING NEW OR BE MORE POWERFUL. IT CAN BE SOLVED SIMPLY. FOR INSTANCE, PARENTS AND TEACHERS SHOULD TRY TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO WHAT A CHILD WATCHS AND TALK TO HIM OR HER ABOUT IT OR JUST DO NOT LET WATCH TV. IT IS BETTER TO SPEND TIME IN THE MUSEUM OR THE NEAREST PARK. OF COURSE, IT IS NOT SO MUCH, BUT IT IS A GOOD START.

SECONDLY, ONE OF THE MOST DANGEROUS CAUSES HERE IS CRIMINAL SITUATION IN THE TOWN OR ON YOUR STREET. IT MUST BE PREVENTED THAT CHILDREN CAN HAVE AN OPPURTUNITY TO SOCIALIZE IN SUCH PLACES. THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY NOT ONLY FOR PARENTS AND TEACHERS BUT FOR THE GOVERMENT TOO IS GENTRIFICATION. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE USA NUMBER OF GETTOS WERE REBUILT, SO THE LEVEL OF CHILDREN/S CRIMES WENT DOWN. MOREOVER, ACTIVE CITIZENS ORGANIZED LOTS OF ACTIVITIES AND CLACCES FOR THE KIDS WITH PROBLEMS.

HOWEVER, CAUSE OF MIND PROBLEMS EXISTS AND AFFECTS THE STATISTICS. ACCORDING TO THE DATA, IF MENTAL DESEASES WERE FOUND ON THE FIRST STAGES IN CHILDHOOD, WE WOULD PREVENT MUCH MORE CRIMES IN AGE OF 16-21. PARENTS AND TEACHERS HAVE TO WORK TIGHTLY WITH PSYCOLOGISTS TO FIND OUT THE PROBLEM AND HELP A CHILD. AS IT CAN BE SEEN, TEENAGERS ARE RESERVED, AND ONLY GOOD SPECIALIST CAN PROVIDE APPROPRIATE HELP TO PREVENT CRIMES OR EVEN SUICIDE IN THE FUTURE.

OVERALL, IT IS IMPORTANT TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. IT CAN BE WAYS THAT WERE PROMOTED BY ME OR SOME GOVERMENT PROJECT, BUT ALL IN ALL, PROBLEM MUST BE SOLVED, BECAUSE THE YOUNGER GENERATION IS OUR FUTURE AND NOW IT IS NOT SO TRUSTFUL AS SOCIETY WANTS TO SEE IT.
