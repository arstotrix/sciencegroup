Nowdays humanity live side by side with technology. Almost everyone has a phone, microwave or TV in his house. Our life become more comfortable with it but it has another side of medal. A lot of people suppose that technology can caused a lot of health problems. 

As we know, every technical invention that we use has a radiation. It’s gives not to much from one phone but if you lige gull of getjets the number of radiation is really high. Radiation dameges our organism so it’s causing a deathly issues. Moreover people have to know how to use technologies or it can damage them phisicaly. 

Some people are to reduce this problem by refusing from technologies at all. I don’t think that it’s the right way. In our time you have to deal with computers and phones so I think that people should use technologies wisely. People must understand what they really need and how they can use it.  If men refuse from every technology he will isolated from the world. He could not communicate with people who far away from him for example. 

In conclusion I want to say that people should to know what they really need.
