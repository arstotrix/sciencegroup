Nowadays people ears large amount of food everyday. Kinds of food in different countries are different and have own degrees of ability. Somebody think, that the food producing in any thing country need to it’s population only and omport food must gets as little attention as possible. In this article I try to discuss this problem from every sides and give argument for my opinion.

First, there are many countries have small part of worlds resourses and food ground for selection of different cultures, vegetables and fruits. They can not produce enough food to their own population, but they have another resourses, that they can sell on the world market and for his money have able to buy the foods. In our days it is very popular problem of Afroca’s republics and north countries, for example. 

Second, I think, that population don’t want to wat saim food every day, if it is greatest testy food in the world. People’s organism needs to get large number of health vitamins from different vegotables and fruits, that growth in another parts of the world. Of course somebody can fly to weekends to another parts of the world, but many people have not this ability. So it is very necessary have acses to import food as soon as to own.

In conclusion I would say that I disagree with this point, because verybody must have different kind of food from different parts of the world. This food have own vitamins.
