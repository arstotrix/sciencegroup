Nowadays government decides to provide scientists with money in order to let them do research in space. However, some people are completely aginst that because these money can solve various problems connected to society like poverty or environmental issues. Altough many years ago before space explortions money was spent on these problems, issues were not solved.
Space explorations can give us a lot of opportunities in the future. That is not a secret that our planet Earth is dying from toxic wastes, pollutions and so on. In many years it can die completely. That is why, if scientists find a new planet to live, human beeing as a kind will be able to survive after catastrophy.
On the other hand, people have problems right now. And doing something with poverty or environmental issues can save many people. However, space explorations can rescue not just many but all people from death if the new planet is found in case a comet or an asteroid destroys our planet. Furthermore, there is definetely not much money to save people from social problems. This problem is too big for the government and it has existed for too long to believe that it can be solved at all.
In conclusion, space exploration is a very important issue for people. It can save a lot of people one day. Certainly, government has to continue give money on it because social problems has always existed and spending money on it will not help it.
