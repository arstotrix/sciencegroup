People’s opinion on the problem of sharing illegal copies of films and music is differ widely. Some people believe that there is no sin in watching pirate copies while others claim that copying and sharing music or films must be punished.
It is my firm belief that it is problems of musicans and film producers if somebody “gets” their money, so they should pay more attention to their problem of saving it. In addition, I consider that if I could find good film in high quality with good translation and it has no differ with original that cost some money, I may download it without doubts or regrets.
Nevertheless, there are opponent of this view who claim that it is bad. They also point out that everyone should buy original versions thinking about producers’ money. But I strongly disagree with them, because people should pay money only for tickets in the cinema and music halls, especially if they see singers alive. But if I watch film at home, it could be free. I also want to repeat that if people (I mean producers and musicans) lose money, they just try bad to save it.
In addition, goverment shouldn’t punish people, who use illegal copies; if it want to solve this problem it should try to stop copying and sharing music or film and punish people who make such files.
I hope, my arguments are convincing, and somebody could support my point of view.
P.S. I also want to remark that original films and music that cost money are not always given in perfect quality. In contrast with pirates’ copies that everybody always can find with good translation and download very quickly.
