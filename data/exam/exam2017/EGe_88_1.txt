The graph illustrates the percentage use of three different networks by online adults in the USA by age group.
Overall, it can be seen, that the social network all of the age groups use the most is Facebook, whereas the least popular social network among them is instagram.However, the correlation between the age groups and the social networks are still obvious. For instance, the youngest age groups use Instagram more than all the others combine (53% to 42%, respectively). The age group of 18 to 29 seems to be dominating in usage of Facebook as well, even though the difference compared to age groups from 30-49, 50-64 and 65+ is not that big (87% to 73%, 63%, 56%).
Finally, the percentage usage of LinkedIn in different age groups are about the same. For example, the youngest (18 to 29 years old) and the the oldest (65+ years old) use it just as much, precisely 22% in both cases, whereas 1% more of those in the age group from 30 to 49 use that social network, than those from 50 to 64.
In conclusion, the older generation uses internet and social networks in particular mostly for communication and work (Facebook and LinkedIn), opposed to young people, that use it for entertainment also (Instagram).
