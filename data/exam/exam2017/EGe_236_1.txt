The pie charts present data on the trasporting of different goods in Eastern Europe in 2008 using different types of vehicles.
As it can be seen, the first place of goods moved by rail is occupied by the metals (35%), while by road this matherail is trasported not so often (only 11% and the fifth place among other goods). At the same time the number of food products moved by road accounts for 30% and occupies the first place in this chart. However, the rail is used much less to import and export food products (only 11%).
There are some spheres in which trasportation by rail and by road has approximately the same level: manifatured goods (25% and 28%) and chemicals (11% and 16%).
In general, these two types of transportation mainly devide the sectors of goods between each other: some of them are mostly moves by road and some are usually trasported by rail.
