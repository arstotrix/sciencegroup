The firgure compare date between development of eBook ant the print ones in 2014 and 2018 in the USA, the UK, Germany and China. It is clear, that there are two different tendences: the number of ebooks will decrease to 2018 or, in contrast, will increase.
Frstly, I want to highlight information in development of ebooks in countries. The number of increase in China and Germany will be similar - nearly 0,5 billion US dollars while the USA will demonstrate much more rapidly raising - from 5,5 to 8,5 billion US dollars. It is evident that the lowest development of the book market is in the UK whereas the highest in the USA.
Furthermore, undoubtly that statement 'ebooks will be more popular' won't be true. The number of print books in Germany will remain stable, in China and the UK it will quietly fell and only in the USA it will be nearly doubled to 2018. Moreover, upward trends in using ebooks are ni all four countries: in the USA from 5,5 billion to 8,5, in China: from 0.5 to 1; in the UK from 1,8 to 2,3 and in the Germany from 1 to 0,5 billion in Dollars.
