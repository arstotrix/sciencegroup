The given charts represent the amount of transportation of different kinds of goods by various transport, in particular, by rail and by road. It is clearly seen, that some kinds of goods, mostly, food products are more frequently transported by road. On the other hand, it is more common to transport such things as metals and machinery by road.
It is obvious that this situation is caused mostly by two factors: the weight of products to be transported and the time in which they should be delivered. For example, such goods as chemicals and food products spoil clearly faster than metals and machinery. That is why it is better to take them to a place by road, which clearly takes less time. However, another important factor is the weight of products and materials, because it is a lot cheaper to transport heavy metals and machinery by train than by any auto-transport. Nevertheless, such things as manufactured goods which are both light and not-spoiling can be trasported by both rail and road.
