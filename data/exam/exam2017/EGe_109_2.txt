In our modern world petty crimes are not something that appears rarely and surprises us. What is more, some serious crimes become more common every year.
The major issue, which is drastically changing our world, is that those crimes are often committed by youngsters. Nothing emerges from nothing, therefore there are certain causes of such a demeanor.

To my mind, one of the main things that cause teenagers to make dire mistakes of committing a crime is a lack or just bad parenting. Sometimes parents remain the main reason of child's wrong behavior. Thus, in my opinion, to solve a problem like this our government should make compulsory parenting courses for people who are thinking of starting a family. This decision should be well thought through and consciously made.
The second cause of young people committing crimes may be the absence of information of what follows after it. It would be great if teachers at schools could give students lectures concerning the punishment that the crime is followed by. Not only will it discourage students from doing something stupid, but also it will make them more educated in terms of law, which is a brilliant bonus.

Last but not least is the one that mainly affects the psychological aspect. Sometimes young people could act like this because of how little attention they are given. I suppose, that the solution would be for teachers and parents to support them and show that they are surrounded by people who love, need and care about them.

If the government, parents and teachers all together take action as soon as possible the situation may be slowed down or even stopped. Such issues that young people are involved in should always be raised and solved fast as long as it is not that dramatic.
