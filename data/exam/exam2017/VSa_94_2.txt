The experience of summer Olympics-2016 in Rio showed the actuality of drug use problem in big sports and provoked a wide discussion. Some people say that athletes caught using illegal drugs should leave professional competing for the rest of their lives, others are sure that a limited period of banning of those athletes is enough. This essay will discuss both positions and state the one with wich the autor agrees.
The idea of banning athletes using drugs for the rest of their lives has its right to exist. First of all, because sport is about discipline - and following the rules. Furtermore, professional sports are just about hardworking and leaving the cheating athletes in professional sports, even after 2 years of banning, would be a disrespect of lifelong work of those, who never used illegal drugs and achieved high result by their own forces. Finally, sportsmen have to be an example for society, especially for youngmen and kids, inspiring them to work hard on their roads to success, so banning drug-using athletes forever could prevent a decrease of moral and motivation between future generations.
However, every person has a right to make a bad decision someday - we are all people, with our own vices and passions. So those, who are for banning cheating sportsmen for a limited period are also right. This sort of restriction is promoting the humanity, wich is a basic idea of any big competition. It also translates to society a very important idea, that we all have a chance to correct the faults of our past and have a prospering future.
To conclude, I would like to say that both these views are relevant, but I agree withe the second one. Professional sport competitions, like Olimpic games, are not about winning: they are about being people, wherever you come from and whoever you are. And I'am pretty sure that there is nothing as important for a human being, than giving each other a chance.
