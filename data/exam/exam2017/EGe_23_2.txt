All over the world there is a great variety of crimes happening every day and there is no doubt that the rate of crime is increasing dramatically.According to the estimates, particularly the younger generations who commit a crime is on the rise.
In this essay I will try to explain the reasons for the enchancement of offence rate and offer some solutions.
To begin with, I sould say that in most countries some youngsters can't find a good job.
In some deprieved countries the government is not able to generate job places for residents and when people can't find any duty to do they try to get money by other ways such as crime. They shoould keep their family with all the essentials and urgent things but they don't have money for that.
Thereby, people and especially the young try to make a fortune with illegal things like drug abuse or burglary and offences.

What is more, the teenagers are too prone to commit a crime because of their friends who may inffluence on them.
Furthemore, some teens don't last their education due to some problems such as family issues. Instead of being at schoold they wander during the day in streets with their peers and when they do not have money to buy what they want , teens think about robbery or other staling offences.
These all facts lead to commiting a crime.


There are possible solutions to tackle with this problem.The government and parents should do accurate thing for youngsters. The government has to create job places where young people can do something to earn money. In terms of parent's duty they must be friend of their children and assist their kids to solve their problmes and always stand by them. At schools teachers also should try to help students when it comes to different issues.

To sum everything up I should say that lack of social and educational knowledge are one of the main factos which can increase crime among young children and everything is in the hands of parents,teachers and government as well.
