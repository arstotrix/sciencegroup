Today professional sportsmen tend to boost their results with the help of forbidden substances. It is argued that contestants that were proven to consume illegal drugs should not ever be allowed to participate in competition while another point of view suggests that penalty shouldn't be so strict and should last only several years. This essay will overview both opinions and make a conclusion.
Some people believe that sportsmen that were caught cheating once would continue to use steroids and other means of increasing their physical possibilities even after few year of disqualification. Sadly, sport industry has know such cases. First places at professional competitions bring loads of money, and that is the reason why athlets continue to commit crimes. Banning unfair stars could open a way to young and ambitious people who could be more interested in honest competition.
The opposite argument is that disqualification shouldn't be permanent. Certainly, cheating is a serious crime but does is really deserves such punishment? Professional athlets put all their lives to achieve success, and all their aspirations are connected with sport triumphs. They often can't do anything else except their profession, so leaving a career forever might mean an end to all their perspectives. The other point is that any separete disqualifications. no matter how long they are don't solve the whole problem of illegal drugs use. Much more serious sleps shoud be taken to cope with such issue, the whole system should be overlooked and reformed.
To sum up, drugs use in sport remains a serious problem. life-long penalty has some minor benefits but it doesn't change the whole situation. Neither does short ban for two years although permanent ban could keep more competitors from unfair game.
