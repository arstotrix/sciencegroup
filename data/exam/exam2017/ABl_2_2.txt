Nowadays, there is a growing tendency to copy and share some types of electronic information illegally. It is mostly connected with the increasing importance of the Internet for people. In my opinion, punishing people for doing such crimes should be cancelled, because of the context of new market, which changes under the pressure of the Internet.
First of all, it is important to understand that you cannot control all of the information in the web networks. There are many people, who copy and share content of electronic information illegally, but catching and punishing all of them will be really expensive. The cost of this may be probably higher than the loss of money from the process of “pirating”.
Secondly, modern market moves in the direction of micro transactions, instead of simple selling the product. You can get more money from consumer, who has free access to some fragments of your film, but pays for the other fragments. However, this strategy can also be violated by pirates, because they can make copies of expensive fragments. Besides, statistics shows that this method of fighting with pirates is more effective than punishing them.
Last but not least, punishing pirates leads to the violation of the right for the freedom in the Internet. By monitoring and controlling cases of illegal copying of the information, companies will interrupt private life of people and their opportunity to be free in the web.
Taking everything into consideration, my disagreement with the punishing of the people, who copying and sharing music or films illegally, can be explained by the influence of the Internet on the modern market system. law should be appropriate to the instantly changing reality and deal with pirates as with the common element of modern world.
