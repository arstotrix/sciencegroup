The bar chart demonstrates the differences in social networks' use by american adults of various ages.

Facebook is clearly the most popular one, scoring from 57% of senior citizens to astounding 87% of the youth. Instagram is far less successful, having a minimum of mere 6 percent of the elderly. LinkedIn shows the most stable numbers among different age groups, having from 22 to 31 percent of users in each one.

According to the chart, Facebook dominates the market, having more than a half of users over fifty, almost two thirds of those between 30 and 49 and nearly nine tenths of the younger adults. Instagram seems quite popular with the younger generations, but has a sudden fall passing the 30 years mark and another one at 50, and yet another at 65. It halves after every age group's border. LinkedIn does have a smaller audience,but those numbers do not fluctuate as much as the others.

Despite the stereotype, younger people do not dominate all the spheres of the internet. LinkedIn, being a less popular type of social network, does have a bigger audience among the people from 30 to 65. Instagram rapidly loses its appeal with the audience's aging. And Facebook remains one of the most successful projects of modern technology with its incredibly wide spread.
