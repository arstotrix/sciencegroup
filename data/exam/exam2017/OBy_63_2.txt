Now days our modern world have a lot of new technologes. Some of that technologes can develop some illnesses. 

It is generally agreed today that new technologes desturb us. First of all – it is polluted air. Of course, we ride cars, almost every family have 1 car, sometimes not one car. It is very big problem, that we can not marge to stop using cars, but people solve thith problem with eco-cars.

On the othe hand all over around the world there are a lot of factorys. It is the same proble – poluted air, big factories make more bad braze. Some people can not leave in big cities, becaus the have problem with helth, bad skin, hair. We can stay week and die in young age. I think we can use less cars and cycling, by eco food, donot bilt new factoris, do not kill wild animals and save flora and fauna. 

From these aguments on must coulud that we should save our planet.
