The bar chart illustrates the proportion of the usage of three social networks by American people of four different groups.
As it can be clearly seen from the chart, Facebook is the most popular site. Almost 90 per cent of young people of the age 18-29 and 73 per cent of those surveyed who are 30-49 years old use this social network. It is also widely used by respondents who are older than 50: more than a half of people of age groups of 50-64 and 65+ are active users of Facebook.
As for two other sites which were analyzed, the survey shows that they are less popular than Facebook. For most of the groups the percentage is relatively small. It is especially obvious for Instagram: it accounts for 25 per cent of respondents of the age group of 30-49 yars old and 11 and 5 per cent of those of groups 50-64 and 60+, accordingly. However, a distinctive feature of this site is that approximately half of the young aged less than 30 use it. Whereas the percantage of the users of LindIn is more equally distributed: no more than 31 per cent for each group.
Overall, the graph shows that Facebook is the most common site among mentioned and the young are the most active users of the social networks.
