The bar chart compares the print and electronic book market in Germany, China, the UK and the USA in 2014 with a forecast for 2018. Overall, the sells of both items were the highest in the USA, wich are predicted to keep a leading position in 2018.
There are two countries, where the number of eBooks sold in 2014 is increadibly low. In Germany the amount of money gained on this item is only 1 billion US dollars, wich is 6 times less then the data of print books. In China, the difference between these two positions is even more appealling: 0,5 billion US dollars (eBooks) comparing to 4,8 billion (print). Despite a small rise of those numbers forecasted for 2018, both countries would earn 3-4 times more on printed books.
As for the UK, wich is the country with the lowest book market income, it is also the only country where the data is quite on the same level in both print and eBooks categories. It is 2,6 billion dollars for print books an 1,8 billion for the electronic ones (approximately 05% of difference). It can also be seen, that in 2018 the eBook market is predicted to reach the mark of 2,3 billion dollars, that would make 3 million more, than the print book market income.
