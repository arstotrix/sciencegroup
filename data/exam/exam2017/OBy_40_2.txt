Nowadays it is often discussed that using modern technology a lot causes an increasement of various health problems, but there are some ways to reduce it.

It is a well known fact that in todays world people use gadgets a lot. Computers and cell phones became necessary things for almost all of us, so that we use them more often than any other things and this is very harmful for our eyes. Sitting in front of the computer during work day and then spending time looking at phone screens makes our eyes very stressed. Moreover, it causes pain in back. Moreover, today most people use cars and walk on foot very little, which also leads to physical weakness and sometimes even to obesity.

However, there always some ways to reduce the harmful impact of technologies. For instance, it is obvious that ones who spend a lot of time working on computer should remember to make a rest regularly, as even 5-10 minutes of eye-exercises helps to avoid eye stress, which can result in short-sight. Furthemore, it is always better to go on foot. Spending spare time by walking in the park is also much more healthier than chatting in socias nets. In addition, we need to do some sport in order to keep in shape and avoid such problem as obesity. Besides, only physical activity helps to have a better mood and feel full of evergy.

Taking everything into account, I would like to point out that even though the unreasonable and not wize use of modern technologies can cause health problems, to avoid them and stay healthy
