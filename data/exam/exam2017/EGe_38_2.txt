Nowadays there are lots of diverse sports events or TV programs which most of people do prefer watching. However, some people believe that such an activity does not worth our time. This essay disagrees with this statement because the sphere of sport plays a great role in our life today. In this essay I will provide some reasons in order to support my opinion, followed by the relevant examples.
As for the first point, watching live sports occasions or TV matches can make people closer to each other. When people have more free time on their hands, they gather together, support their team and communicate. A good exapmle here can be the The World Hockey Championship which is hold every year in spring. Spectators become like one team which watch all the matches, reveal some mistakes of players and spend good time. For instance, the play between Russia and Finnland is always complicated beacuse these teams are usually neck and neck. In other words, it is a level playig field, and people can realize what the real patriotic feeling is.
As for another point, the process of watching such sports events may help people, especially women, to know more about different types of sport. What I mean is that we can learn the special vocabulary, which is considered to be specific for each kind of sport. Moreover, in our daily life we use a great number of idioms and phrases in our speech which have come from sport. For example, the idiom "to jump the gun" from racing which means "to hurry" or "to do something before a start".
In conclusion, I would like to say the theme of sport is vital today and plays a signifant role. That is why watching sports events is essential and people who belive that it is a waste of time should rethink this issue.
