Most of the counrys nowadays trading with the others a lot, but is this the right thing for a country to import tons of food rather than try to produce it itself?

For countrys that do not have enough resources it is necessary to buy food from more fortunate ones, but countrys like Russia, United States, Great Britain and many others can actually live with minimum import of products, they can feed their own people, like Soviet Union did. Little amount of import would actually make a country more independent from the other world so that it’s problems won’t cause a lot of suffering for the population, like it would have, if country depended much on, for example, dairy products of neighbour, which suffered from decrease, that struch their cows. 

Development of country’s production of food would also increase a number of the workplaces, and it would have a great impact on economics of the country, but it can still trade with others. It may prevent a deficit of something important, it also will make the relationship with others much better. North Korea is a good example how isolation ma be extremely bad for people. That way lead to starvation, bad relationship or even hate from the world. Import and export is very important for people’s lives. That gives them a chance to choose a better product. That gives a competition for country’s cimpani, which will cause them to make there food better and/or cheaper. Afteral little import dies have it’s pluses, but in my opinion countryes should trade with.
