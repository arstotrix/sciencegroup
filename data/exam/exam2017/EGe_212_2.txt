Nowadays, in the times of globalization, it is getting harder to support local entrepreneurs. It concerns not only agricultural business, but also the film-making industry. The question is: should our government spend more money trying to change this situation or is it better to leave it alone?
In my opinion, the government should not give more money to local film industries. I do not think that having a bigger budget will change things drastically. For example, in Russia, in the 90s, films were amazing. However, they did not have a lot of special effects to boost their quality. Films were great because of the talent that was put into them. Actors were giving an Oscar-winning perfomance and the director's ideas were always relevant to the mindset of the people. Now, I am not saying that today we do not have good films, but the ratio of good and bad films that are shown on big screens is very big and it should not be like this.
Some people may argue that without a bigger financial support, some ideas cannot be recreated and that British or American films are this popular because they have a lot of money put into them. They can say that because the government will not spend more money on the film industry, great directors or actors can be left out. Obviously you need money to have a proper equipment, they may say, to get the best crew that is possible. Good actors need a bigger salary, therefore, directors need a bigger budget to be able to afford them. This opinion is not totally wrong, although if a film is really good, some actors can agree to work for free if they think that this film will get a lot of fame.
All in all, this question is very difficult and has a lot of different opinions. I believe, that before our government invests into local film industries, it should invest into education in order to make qualified specialists in certain areas that are necessaire in making the greatest film possible.
