Now people can find all of the information just using the Internet. There are lots of books, films, music and so one. But lots of these copies are illegal and free â€“ people can just download something, but authors and musicians will not get some money for it. It is really big problem. Authors try to find some way to prevent illegal download using law. They say that it is theft and users of this files are robbers.
I agree with them, because before musicians or film producers did something, they work for a long period of time and spend lots of money. For example some films are made by lots of people, and the quantity of money for this films is more than billions of dollars. Of course, authors want to get some money. Secondly, I want to say, that music and films not only work, but also an own idea. Authors made something unique, something new for peoples mind. Thirdly, then musicians or film producers will not get some money, they can not make new master pieces.
From the other hand, people say, that musicians and producers have lots of money and if they download just one films, nothing changed. The other reason, that music, fillms, books are really expensive and not all of people can buy them.
I think that for musicians and producers it is their work and they must get some money. If it is too expensive to buy something, people can go in the cinema or library to get what they need.
In conclusion I want to say, that it is work of goverment to prevent illegal download, because authors are workers, who pay taxes. Illegal download is a crime and I see that people need to fix this situation.
