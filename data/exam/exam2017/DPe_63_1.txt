The represented chart illustrates the unemployment rate in certain world regions in 2014 and 2015 years.
As we can see from this chart the unemployment rate unsignificantly changes in all regions. The Middle East and Latin America have decrease in their rate no more then 2 per cent in 2015. However, only EU unemployment rate lifts up from 7,5 per cent to 7,9 per cent. Althouth, the most remarkable feature from the shown chart is the rates from three regions left that remain stable without any slight drop or rise. Despite of the changes the highest unemployment rate belongs to the North Africa, while the lowest rate is demonstrated by South Asie that is only 3,9 per cent.
To sum up, I would like to mention that changes in the unemployment rate can be practically not observe, hence, the majority of represented rate is flat in both years 2014 and 2015.
