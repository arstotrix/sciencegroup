The graph illustrates amount of money gained by the book markets in four states in 2014 and a prediction for 2018. It can be clearly seen that the USA are a prominent leader in book selling.
First of all, the USA benefit from print books in 2014 consisted 10,5 billion of US dollars, while nearly the half of this amount of money was received from eBook trade (5,5 billion). The forecast shows, however, a significant decrease in print books profit, which is from 10,5 to 7,5 billion, and a dramatic rise in eBook saling to tremendous 8,5 billion. Turning to Germany, its benefit from print in 2014 was 6 billion dollars, whilst eBook revenue consisted a tiny 1 billion. Despite this amount not being great, forecast tells that it will change to 1,5 billion in 2018. As for print, it is believed to remain stable. Regarding Chinese market, it's revenue from saling was 4,8 billions in 2014 and is predicted to fluctuate unsignificantly to 4,2 in 2018. It is shown that eBook profit will rise to 1 billion from 0,5, which is insufficient too. The last point to consider is the UK, where amount of money gained from both print and electronic books trade is quite low: 2,6 billion for print and 1,8 for eBook in 2014, which will hesitate to 2 billion and 2,3 respectively.
