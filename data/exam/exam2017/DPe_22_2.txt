Nowdays music and film production is highly developed. The huge investments directed to creating of that content. Some people do not want to pay for that content. When they get illigal copy, they stole money of creators. I think those people should be restricted.
First of all, when someone create some contant, that is his own privicy. Then, that men should be regarded for his work. The money he will get will be used for creating of new content For example the sifted musician created alboum, and his music is highly rated, people like it. But, author donot get any money for his alboum, and he lose incentive to create next part. People will be inable to listen the another alboum, becouse they didâ€™t pay for first alboum and just downloaded it for free.
Secondly, the coping of infornation without payment is restricted by law If people do not consider that law necessery, the other laws will not have any sence for them. For example, that will lead to anarchy and life will be worse. More over, illigal coping stops develonment of culture. Musicians dont wand to create anythig becouse it will be stolen. Society will degrodate
To sum up, illigal coping of fillms and music and films make danger not only for creators but for consumers too. Also that stops development of our society. and causes its degradation.
