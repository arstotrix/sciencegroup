Nowadays more and more crimes are commited by young people. I think it happends because of two reasons namely unemployment among youth, migration.
It is well known that unemployment among young people is higher than among other ages. In some countries this difference is not very big, but in Spain, Greece etc. the number of young people who have no job is catastrophicaly high. So some of this people commit crimes to get money, some of them are rich enough, but they have nothing to do. Lack of activities forces this guys to join radical groups (like nazi, antifasists etc.). To diminish influence of this factor goverment needs to provide economical grows in order to decrease unemployment.
The second reason is migration. The majority of immigrants come from less civilized countries without strong traditions of law-obidience, so migrant comit crimes much more freqiently than natives. But also we know that migrant usually are young males (who want to find better job).
So boom in migration causes increase in number of crimes commited by young people. I think that government must prohibit immigration from uncivilized countries and accept only educated and law-obidient migrants.
The third reason is that youth is less moral and less religions than their parents. Unfortunately this problem cannot be solved without abandoning distructive ideology of liberalism.
All in all, I think that criminalization of youth can be stopped if government really want it.
