Nowadays, people are facing the problem of using illegal drags on sport competitions. Some humans believe that sportsmen, who take drugs should be banned for a certain period, whereas the others think that they should be banned forever. This essay will disscuss both points of view surrounded this issue.
On the one hand, the ban for a limited period gives a chance for an athlete to continue his career. This limit provides a time for a sportsman to rethink what he did and prepare to next competitions. The main point of it is that these sportsmen should always be under control of Organisation of drug control. For example, there was a scandal on the Olympic Games in Rio about drugs and some athletes were banned. They could not compete there, however, they will be participate in next Olympic Games, so it is their chance to present their country again.
On the other hand, banning for the rest of sportsmen's lives can be cause of their psychological problems Athlete can not live without competitions, he needs to use his skill with his opponents. Besides, athlete loses his fans and this can have a negative impact on their psychological health. In addition, the country loses the valuable sportsman, who can compete and bring high results and gives a country respect from other states.
To conclude, the banning of sportsmen because of their drugs-taking is a strong punishment, however from my point of view it should be temporary as denying for the rest of their lives causes many negative outcomes both for athlete and his country.
