In recent years the concern about the protection of copyrights of the Internet’s contents has increased significantly as there are more and more contents that are uploaded to the Internet including music, movies. Many people believe that all the online contents should have their copyrights protected as well as online piracy should be considered as crime. In my opinion, I think that there should be punishments for online piracy; the punishment should be lowered base on the types of content. 

Although online piracy is contributed to many financial problems as well as human brain draing, I think that it should be considered as heavy crime and punishments can be djusted. Firstly, sharing is one of the humanity’s basic instinct. It is inevitable because of the internet. Beside new-released contents there are alse countries contents that are created long time age. Personal speaking, I think the old music or movies are not wothly to pay to savor, but they are too old compared to those newly released. Not all the Internat’s contents should have copyrights, but sometimes some of them should and for that, raising people’s awareness regarding to how, the piracy can cause the author of the writer of the song and why they should use copyrighted productions. Furthermore, people don’t even know how they will damge the author of they use piracy contents, so raising the awnereness. 

In conclusion, I believe that picating in Internet  is a real crime.
