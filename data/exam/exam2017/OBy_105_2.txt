Music as well as film industry is a complicated business system made for our entertainment. And as any business requires it supposed to bring an income.

These industries are driven by large sums of money. They create an original content that the audience wants to pay for. And the problem is that any work with built in creativity is pot under pressure when the money comes in to the game. That happens when the producers and creators forget about ethical side and start to earn money for empty senseless product. 

In my opinion, as far as big industry players concerned, it is not unforgivable to download some of their materials. You may want to go to the cinema when a new sequel of famous franchise comes out but only because you want to be in the trend and avoid spoilers on the Internet.

On the other hand we have small directors and unknown talented music artists that want to seen and earn for living with their work. In this case I strongly support buying the original product. The profit from selling goes straight to the creator and it contributes to his future work. It is win win story. You have an exclusive product, a viayl or a DVD, that will stay for you way longer than a downloaded file on the computer. The feeling of a physical copy is more authentic to me. 

All in all, I think no one should be strictly punished for listening to a song or watching a film privately even from a downloaded copy. But I encourage people to appreciate a good original content and paying for it.
