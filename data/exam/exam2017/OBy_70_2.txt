It is a well known fact that people today have a lot of problems with their health because of the use of computers and other technologied devices. Some of this problems are very serious, some of them can be easily reduced. 

The most common problem for people nowadays is the lack of mobility. We spend a great part of the day sitting by our computers. People who work sit near the computer almost 8 hours without even getting up. Even students who are supposed to be healthy and active suffer from this problem. To reduce this issue, special exercises brakes can be introduced in offices, maybe even in universities and schools. It is crucial to have some resting time during work and studying, but it’s also important for this break to be helpful physically and mentaly. And of course let’s not forget about the healthy diet a person should have and the importance of staying hidrated. 

Another problem that is discussed a lot today is peoples’ dependence on mobile phones and the internet.  A lot of my friends agree that they can’t live without  their phones. The constant need of communication and information stays behind that. However, I think that sometimes we need to have some tome for ourselves. Therefore one of the ways of dealing with this particular problem would be meditation. It is an easy way to relax and ger yourself together, clear  your head from all the unnecessary information that comes to us everyday. In my opinion, this is a great habbit everybody can develop. 

To conclude, I can say that despite the fact that we live in a world  full of modern technology, we shouldn’t be lazy and we shouldn’t forget to take care of our personal health.
