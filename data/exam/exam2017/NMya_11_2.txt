In the modern world young people commit more crimes than it was previously. I presume that the main causes of such development are dramatic increase in technologies, its’ availability for wide masses and, as a result, lower engagement in social interactions of young people.
To start with, now children and adolescents spend much less time outside, playing football or any other sport with their covenants. As a result, their communication has altered its form and transferred from streets to computers: it is a fact that young people nowadays communicate using social networks more, than in the real life. Besides, the development of online entertainment industry, and namely computer games development, has a significant impact on lack of socialisation among adolescents. Moreover, computer games like shootings or fightings, as well as many videos in the Internet, promote violence towards young people’s minds. All this negative phenomena influence harmfully a modern society.
However, parents and teachers can solve this problem. The formers should not allow their children to spend too much time with their computers and other devices, as well as they should restrict time spending in social networks. Furthermore, parents have to walk more with their children, encourage them to do sport and interact with other children. The latters, teachers, should offer to pupils such interesting topics that would encourage them to study rather than play computer games. Moreover, group projects can increase students engagement in studying and interacting with each other too.
To sum up, rise in quantity of crimes is a great problem and parents and teachers should try to tackle this problem.
