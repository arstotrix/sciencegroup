There is a popular point of view that nowadays there are more crimes committed by teenagers.

To my mind, that statenment is partly true. I see it as a result of lack of morality in our everyday life. Due to the fact that teens do not see a good example of behavour, they start to act as "cool" and "bad guys" from movies. Thus, they pretend to be worse than they actually are. The second reason may be the social status of their family. It is not a surprise that a poor person may steal someone`s wallet to buy some food for himself or for his familly. These circumstances shall also be taken into account. The third reason is concerned the parents of such deviant teenagers. I belive that they do not pay enough ofattention to what their children do in their spare time and to what they are keen on. Sometimes teens just want more attention to themselves and do everything not to be ignored.

To solve the problem of teenagers` criminality parents and teachers have to work together. I may give some pieces of advice to them. Firstly, parents shall control what their children watch in the Internet or on the TV to reduce the bad influence. Moreover, teachers may show good films such as "One flight over the cockoo`s nest" in school to educate the teens. Beside, parents shall give a good example of how to behave to their children. You can not blame your children for being rude if you are also rude. Sometimes young people need more love from their parents and it can be helped just by being nice to them. Finally, teachers shall help teenagers becoming better and not just punish them for every mistake that they make.

To sum up, the problem of teenagers`s criminality comes from different places. The teenagers are not only ones to blame. To be honest, I would like the society to assist deviant teens with socializing. I hope that one day there will be less criminals among the young people.
