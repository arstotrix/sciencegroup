The graphs below demonstrate the shift in death and birth rates, as well as population growth in the USA from 1750 to 2000.
The first graph shows stable numbers of population growth from 1750 to 1800, followed by a slight rise from 1800 to 1850. The next two 50 years are marked by a monotonous rise from 25 to 150 millions of people, then goes the most significant growth by 125 million to the year 2000.
The second graph demonstrates the birth and death rates both gradually falling down through years, birth rate staying higher than death one. The sharper fall of death rate from 1800 to 1850 and the higher soaring of birth rate from 1950 to 2000 can be highlighted.
Finally, the changes depicted above are tightly connected, for example, we see the most significant rise in both birth rates and population growth from 1950 to 2000, as well as more or less stable numbers in all the graphs from 1800 to 1850.
