Nowadays technologies con not he separated from people lives. Neither litle kid nor adult is able to exist comfortable without technics. Dependance of modern technologies can create some new world wide health probles. Whut are they? How those probles can be solved?
Despite the fact that modern tehnics make our lives easier, they can also create sone serious healthissues. The first thing, which hates to be said, is that the monitors; phones, TV's con harm your vision. For example, office worker's job is conneted to PC usement. Sonetimes they have to spend hours without rest behind the monitor. In result eyesight is getting worse. Secondly, using gadsets more than it reconended con couse headache. It means thut some peope are not paying to much attention for time that they are wastiong for mobile phones, notebooks and exc. moreover, when people use technics too much they can get some mental problems. There are bunch of people, which are fully dependent on technics and they lose connection with society.
Solving those issues is not that diffucult, as it may be thought. Firstly, everyone should notice that after every wasted our behind technics some physical exercise should be done. In the second place, chotiny in the internet should not inter fare your social life. I mean do not try to raise chating higher than real conversation. Finally, the most simple advice is to regurite the time, which can be spent for tecnins. You have to find some time, for exanple once in a year, when you completely do not use technics.
In conclusion, i would liketo say that in spite of the fact that tecnnics cause health problems. there are precedence, when modern tehnologies help people. As exoskeleton suit or cor navigator.
