The pie charts illustrate the information about transportations of goods between Eastern Europe countries in 2008. Overall, the dates from charts are not the same.
First of all, the pie charts consist of 6 sectors: manufactured goods, machinery, metals, chemicals, non metallic minerals and food products. They analyze railway and road means of transport. It can be point out that 35 percent of metals were transported by rail when only 11 percent of them were transported by road. The percentage of transportation of manufactured goods almost the same at both charts. It can be seen the big difference between machinery and food products transportation, where the difference is more than 10%. However this indicator between chemical goods and non-metallic minerals is slightly different.
To summarize, the percentage of transportation of good is rather volotail and depend on mean of transport.
