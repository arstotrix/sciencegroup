Nowadays there are more and more sportsmen using drugs in their sports. The issue is being discussed now more often than any times earlier. All the technologies are developing and it can't pass by sport. Cases of athlets caught using drugs are so common that the issue of the punishment they have to get is really crusial.
There is an opinion that athlets who used banned drugs have to be out of professional sport for a limited period. It seems to be fair because sometimes it is not the athlet fault, for instanse when it was used by doctors to make an atlet feel better and make the pain less. Sometimes it is not so obvious that some months later the pills will be confirmed as drugs. So, banning the athlet from competing for the rest of his or her life is too strict.
From the other hand, drugs have their influence on sport results even if it was used as medicine - we can't ignore this fact, and usually doctors know about the effects and they use them anyway. Sometimes it is just coach who is informed about the pills' effect and they use them on purpose. However strict punishment for the atlet such as being out of professional competition for the rest of athlet's life can make coaches think twice before cheating.
In my opinion, whole the life disqualification should exist as a form of possible punishment, as a note for all the athlets to be honest: with themselves, their fans and other competitors, however prooves have to be strong and obvious to use this kind of banning. For most the cases, from my point of view, we have ban for grugs for some years. It's enough to make athlet think twice but there is a chance to prove their right for sport. Athough, an athet cauught using drugs more than once has to be banned forever.
