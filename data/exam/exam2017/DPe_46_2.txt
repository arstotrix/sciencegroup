Nowadays, the spread of the Internet made it much easier to use, listen and watch illegal copies of different entertainment products. That is the reason of huge decreases in revenues of great amount of musicians, musical and film producers, and entertainment industry as a whole. These people and their supporters state that onlene piracy must be illegal, and onlene perates must punished by law. 
This essay will discuss, firstly, my point of view on the issue, secondly, several arguments supporting my opinion, and thirdly, conditions under which the problem could be resolved.
To begin with, in my opinion it is illegal to use any sort of pirate copies of any product. I think that every honorable person should avoid using such kind of copies.
Firstly, any kind of labour must be paid. Neither industrial worker nor singer will not do any job or produce any product if he or she does not have money for a flat or house or food.
Secondly, artists or film makers have to be free from problem of earning money for everyday expences in order to be able to produce different pieces of art.
Nevertheless, there must be some conditions under which it will be ethic to call onlene piracy a crime. First of them is that entertainment products should be attainable by the majority of population of a country.
Secondly, it must be easier and more convinient to buy an entertainment product, not to steal it.
To sum up, I want to say that human society needs to come up with a solution for everybody, not just for one separated group of people.
