In our modern world people face the dilemma of whether to punish people who spent their time to copy musical production and films, using the Internet, instead of buying legal discs. Letâ€™s find out it!
First of all, some people think that it is wrong to copy because individuals who fond of music or making films spent a lot of money on this thing. Such kind of people spents its free time to produce music or make a film. People just want to receive their fee. What is more interesting, when a person likes copying and sharing music or another object of art, he teaches his children to do it in the same way. Such children are convinced that it is normal.
Never the less, other people have claimed that it is profitable and convinient to share and copy music or films. They think that it is very expansive for common people buying the original discs. Besides, very often artists, animators and musicians have charged high prices for their works. Usually, common people cannot allow to themselves to have such expansive original films or musical discs. That is why they just copy it. Such people do not think that it is a crime or that they should be punished.
To sum up, I would like to say that illegal pirate copies it is not the best way of enjoying good music or films. In my opinion, copying and sharing art materials should be punished.
