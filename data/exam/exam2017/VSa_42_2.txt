Nowadays modern technologies are used in all speres of people's lives. That is Why it is important to know and remember about side-effects of modern devices and tools because they have bad impact on humanity health.
I agree with opinion that people should be careful using modern technologies in their every day life. Sometimes problems with health may be rather more serious that some advantages of computers, telephones. For example, nowadays due to the mobile phones with the mobile Internet we may got an access to any kinds of information we need at any time and everywhere. This is undoubtly a great advantage for people in fast changing modern world. However, such gadgets also provides teenagers with game, social websites, which may be not only useless for them, but also harmful. By the reason of constant using of modern devices many people have headaches, can see badly and may have a lot of other deseases.
Unfortunately, people don't forsee such health problems, but just try to reduce problems, which they have already had. For example, they go to hospital, take medicine, try to limit their children in using their devices.
At the same time, modern technologies may not have any disadvantages, if people use them rationally. For example, the development of technologies in ship building help people to send and get goods and products faster and more ecologically - friendly.
In conclusion, the increasing number of health problems, caused by the using of technologies should be predicted by scientists. In addiction people should estimate their risks by themselves and reduce usage of devices if they do not really need to use them.
