At the same time the quantity of food product transported by road was three times higher than by rail and the most significant among goods transported by road 30%. The percentages of transportation manufactured good were approximately the same in the both kinds nearly 25% and 28% and had the second position in both charts.

The charts show that the transportation of non-metallic minerals had the opposite situation and was the least in the chart of goods transported by rail.
