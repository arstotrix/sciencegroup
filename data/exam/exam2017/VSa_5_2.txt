It is evidence that issues related to expanding of using modern technologies are important. Scientists maintain that if modern technologies become more popular, it will cause to the rise of health problems. They illustrates a varity of problems, but we will discuss only some of them. 
The most important problem is that modern children have a weak health because of sitting at their home and not doing anything in clean air. For example, they can study at their home by online coursec, to buy food and goods by the Internet, to take part in different evidence. Moreover, modern technologyes impact on the people's psychology system. People become addicted by their phones, computers, games like a drugs and can not to understand what is real or not. It caused that the people can kill themselves or other people, thinking that it is fantasy game. Futhermore, it is significant that today people have more problem s with their eyes and with other important organs because they always site near the different computers or radiote instrument and do not do any physical exercises to improve their abilities. Modern technologies do everything for people and do not give opportunities to develop and strengh their health.
In my opinion, the main solve of this problems is that only teaching children and our new generation that modern technology should be use limitedly and not everywhere will help to reduce the problems with health. Moreover, sciencists can solve these problems themselves if they will find new drugs, which will strenghen people's nervous system, health and physical abilities
To sum up, scientists create modern technologies, so they should help to nation to reduce the number of problems, using different ways as teaching or creating something new.
