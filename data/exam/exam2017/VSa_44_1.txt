The pie charts show the amount of goods transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. The information is given in percents.
It can be seen that he biggest part of railway transportation was taken by metals with 35% while the second chart shows the food production was the biggest part and accounts for 30%. The most distinguishing feature of the first chart is that there is three times as many metals as in the second chart.
A different pattern is that there were approximately 3 times more food products transported by road than by rail. As for machinery goods there were about 5 times more machinery transported by rail in comparison to road transportation with 12% in former and 2% in the latter chart.
The overall view of the charts shows that metals and and machinery prefered to be transported by rail while food products were transported by road. There were also half as many non-metallic goods transported by rail as by road. The other differences between charts is negligible.
