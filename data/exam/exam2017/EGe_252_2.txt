It is considered by scientists that travelling by air has a great harmful impact on our environment and leads to global warming. There is also ideas about reducing the number of such journeys.In my opinion, I think that it is crucial to think about all possible solutions to this issue, however, this idea about introducing laws can also be useful.
There are a couple of other methods that should be implemented to reduce air pollution to which travelling in planes contributes a lot. At first, it is essential to define which journays can be considered not so necessary and which ones cannot be canceled. Of course, all people belive that their journey is important, but cannot they take it going by bus or by train?
Needless to say that it is much slower and less convenient, but governments should encourage such conscious changes of planes and, for instance, provide cheaper tickets for those who decided not to fly but to drive.
Other possible solution is to reduce the number of personal planes and helicopters of movie, football stars and other famous persons. Because quite offten they use it just for one's pleasure and without any real aim.
Moreover, this problem can also be tackled with cancelling those programm of additional free miles that are given to those people who fly a lot. It will not encourage people to travel by planes but by public transport or by trains.
In conclusion, it is important to point out that all these ways of reducing air polluting and global warming which are caused by air travel are not very profitable for governments and airlines, but they can solve the problem.
