Nowadays, some political parties and governments are suggesting a “Guaranteed Basic Income” system in which every citizen of the country gets fixed monthly sum of money, which adds to their other income. There are two opposite points of view whether it is bad or good. I’ll try to observe both advances to the problem and state, which of them is right or wrong in their ideas.
On the one hand, it is claimed to be a working and healthy system, which will improve everybody’s life. Firstly, it is a form of insurance for every citizen in case of emergency, when he will lose his main income due to some illness or something else. Secondly, it helps to rearrange economical goods so as to help someone in need by taking small part of goods from the rich ones using taxes. Finally, such a system may help people to establish some business even without taking a loan from some bank.
On the other hand, there are not only pros but also cons in such system. For instance, this way leads society to degradation as there are fewer reasons to work if you get money for nothing. Moreover, these “Guaranteed Income” is based on government where taxes are high, which means business sphere feels itself worse and whole economic growth of the country is crippled.
To sum up, it is an ambiguous question whether this system is good or not, there are points for and against it, so that it is up to the people in certain countries to decide, which way they prefer more.
