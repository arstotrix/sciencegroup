Many people have absolutly differente reasons to do crime, they could be protecte themselfs or their family. However, it is enought murder, which kill people just for fun or for pleasure in the world or people, who has psyhology problems.
For the first one it could be enought a few years in the prison, because they did the wrong step and must be taken punishment. But in my point of view it is necessary to try the death penalty in our country for the people, who rape the children and kill them, because they are heavy sick and it is not changing by the time. And just prison is not enough for them, because after that, they are going to have freedom again in the soon time and they will be doing awful things again. I think, that death penalty can doing people very scared and they will avoid to do crime.
Of cours, there are some alternative ways of reducing not so heavy crime - it's society work. I guess, that it's good solution: person, who choose the wrong way, can be advanced by helping people and society.
By the conclusion, we can say, that there are many alternative ways of reducing crime, which must be depends by the heavy of crime.
