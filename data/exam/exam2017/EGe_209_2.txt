As many people think that spending money on the space program is just a waste of money, I can agree with them. In my personal opinion we have to explore space.
First of all we always can find something interesting and useful in space. For example ne place for living or some new resources. Who knows, maybe we will be able to find a new type of fuel while exploring space. that will not only help people to save money, but maybe it also will help to save the planet.
Secondly, as we know that if a country got the great space program, it also has a great military program. By exploring new types of space shuttles scientists also learn something about engines and so on. That's very useful in rocket pressing or in some more peaceful way, planes manufacture.
The reason why some people think that exploring space is a waste of money is that the government can spend those money for something more useful for people. For example, poverty or environmental issues. and maybe they are right in some case, but lets think about it in another case. Lots of problems can be solved without government help. When space program is unreal without government assistance. People can try to change world for themselves. For example, joining or creating societies to help our planet or homeless people. That may solve some urgent problems.
That is why I think that governments have to spend money on space exploring, because only government can help science to do even something in the space program.
