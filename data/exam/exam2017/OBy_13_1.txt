The charts below provide the percentage data on goods transportation between countries in Eastern Europe during 2008.

Overall, it is clearly seen that manufactured goods were one of the most actively transported items by rail and by road. Non-metallic minerals appeared to be transported in a considerably less proportion in both charts (6% transported by rail, 13% transported by road).

According to the graph that illustrates transportation by rail, it is evident that meatals and manufactured goods outnumbered other goods marking 35% and 25% respectively. Machinery was transported twice as many as non-metallic minerals reaching 12%. Common numbers depicted by chemicals and food products (11%).

Apparently, tendency varies in the second graph. The most transported goods were food products, surpassing metals in threefold proportion and reaching 30%. Manufactured goods outweighed machinery at 14 times. In almost common proportion chemicals and non-metallic goods were transported, marking 16% and 13% respectively.
