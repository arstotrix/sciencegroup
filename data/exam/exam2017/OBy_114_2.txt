Many people believe that music should only be legal and musicians should receive money for their work. However, there are some experts, who think that pirate copies are more convenient to use and people do not have to pay for music they listen.

I believe that musician should receive money for work they have done. Firstly, it is their work, just imagine that someone did not pay for something you have done for him. Unfortunately, people get used to not paying for music, for example, social networking â€“ vkontakte, where you can find any song you want for free. Just several month ago they did advertising in songs, to pay for musicians. Secondly, the quality of legal music differ from illegal, it is much higher. 

Of course, we can understand people, who do not want to pay for music. For example, it is not convenient, when you cannot paste the song you want in youtube video, nevertheless you name the real author.

Moreover, there are services where you can pay a certain fee for a month and listen any music you want and it will be legal. Every person should decide for himself that for good music you should pay money. But it will be with high quality. 

To sum up, I would like to say that every person should be payed for the work he/she has done. If people will download only legal music it will be more convenient and fair. For example, I listen music in iTunes and do not listen to music n VK, because I understat that the quality is really very different. And the sound is different too.
