Nowadays, the problem with doping became really widespread in many kinds of sport. Some people proclaimed that punishment for using illegal drugs needs to be very serious, but in contrast others strongly believe that athletes must be responsible for their crime only for a small limited period. In my oppinion, international sport assosiation should classify crimes related to using illegal drugs and make desicion due to a big number of different factors, as: reputation of one particular sportsman, type of drug, and many others.
Conserning to the point of view closly linked with the statement that punishment for discribed crimes must be banning from competing professionally during the period of whole life. I can say that proponents of this idea based on the princip of fair play. They allege that such way will help to regulate honest organising of competition and trust "clear" athletes.
As opposed to this point of view, some people convience on the idea that each person is able to make a mistake, so he must have an opportunity to begin his professional careir from the beggining. In this case, they assume that a limited period will be enough for athlet to change his mind (for instanse, 2 or 3 years).
Personally, I reckon that there are some comprehensive approaches in considering this problem. We must diversify small commitments from serious crimes.
Taking everything into consideration, I tend to note a significant sugjects. First of all, punishment for using illegal drugs is really debatable theme. Moreover, modern sport legislation need to be improved and overseen.
