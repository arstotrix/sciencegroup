Nowadays many people claim that business monopoly develops with a huge speed, so that small local businesses cannot compete with multinational brands and have to end their activity. This essay is going to assess the merits and disadvantages of multinational brands in context of development new small ones.
First of all, we cannot deny the fact that multinational brands are recognizable all around the country and they provide people with quality, so that we may be sure in things, that we will get from this company. For example, everyone knows shop named "Zara", each time people visit this place all around the world, they know what kind of clothes they are buying, it is on top of fashion, it made from beautiful materials and so on.

On the other hand, small local businesses pay many taxes, that is the base for country's economy and for its budget. That is the reason why government of the developed countries are trying to encourage appearance of small businesses. Moreover, such a business gives people the opportunity to decide on product, so in Moscow we have many shops of organic food, which do not connected to multinational brands and every time I am buying products for my family I can chose the most appropriate for me thing, that is a great idea. To sum everything up, it should be said that development of large brands do have its advantages, but it does not outnumber the disadvantages that we will get, if small local businesses stop their work.
