On the first chart we can see four bars illustrating the numbers of user of Facebook. They show how many users use Facebook by desktop or by mobile in 2012 and in 2013. The numbers of the users of desktop in both years were near 140 millions. The main changes happens in the mobile sphere: this number increase from approximately 60 millions to 100.
On the second chart we can observe the reasons to use Facebook of men and women (according their own opinions). The numbers of men and women are equal only in one reason - it is receiving updates. In all another reasons there are more women than men. The reasons in the chart are: sharing photos or videos (the biggest difference between men and women, 54% vs. 39% in this reason), seeing funny posts (43% vs. 35%) and learning about ways to help others (35% vs. 25%).
