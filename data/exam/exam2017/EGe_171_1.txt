The given bar chart shows how much time men and women spent doing sport in England. The statistics was collected in 2012.

It is immediately apparent that the group of men at the age of 16-24 spent much more time doing sport than any other group. Comparing to the same age group of women, they did sport roughly twice as much time as women did. Thereafter, at the age of 25 men reduced the time they did sport significantly. The amount of time men did sport at the age of over 45 declined slowly but surely. The decrease of the amount of time women did sport was not so rapid, it fell quite gradually. We can also see that women older than 75 spent the least amount of time doing execises. Interestingly enough that the time men and women spent on sport at the age over 75 was ten times less that they did at the age of 16-24. Unsurprisingly though, people at their early twenties were the most active. One can consider different reasons for that.

Overall, the main tendency that is clearly seen from the bar chart is the decrease of the time doing exercise and sport. The older people became, the less time they spent on physical exercises and active sport.
