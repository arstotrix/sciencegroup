As a standard of living continue to rise, new technologies develop actively. The sphere of music, cinema and media-communications increase every day, but there are a lot of problems on it. For example, one of the most important problems is pirate copying and sharing on different social media. Because of it the inventors of music and films lose a lot of money.

On the one hand, I must say that the production of music and films demands big amount of things and human efforts. Production of media is the ability to earn money. Also illegal copies influences on the advertisment and wishes of millions peoples to watch the film or the cinema or listen to music in the payfull content. One of important things is the quality of films or quality of sounds is very low in illegal pirate copies and people cannot imagine and feel the atmosphere of film or music. This is bery important. 

On the other hand, a lot of people don’t have a money to go to the cinema for watch new film that interested a lot, or buy new soundtrack in App-store or Play market because it may be very expensive for their. Some people don’t like to go to watch films or they can’t do it because of the illness, and they practice to find pirate copies. 

For conclure, I want to say that this problems is very big and producers and users must find the compromise that allow to decide important questions. Media is one of important things in life of human and it allow to find interesting information about feelings, about world and planet.
