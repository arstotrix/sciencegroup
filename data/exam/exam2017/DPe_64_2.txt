Musicunts, filmmakers and other lose a lot of money every year because of pirets. Instead of buying a legal copy of any product pirets are spreading it illegally in the Internet. Why did they do that? Probably, we can find a way to share media content in the Internet without theft.
First of all, everybody who download something in the Internet should be punished, if he done it without acception or paying. We should stay at the position that every work shoud be doing for price or any inmaterial goods, like glory, respect or something like that. In another way the working is not payed. If it so, media maykers have no resurses or no motivation to do something. So if we not pay the makers not create.
The another way to look at this question is to see that person not always can buy the original disc. The can have no way to use disc for example on a modern electronics or have no market with the discs near him. Thats why he have to use Internet and copying something illegally. We can salw this problem with making the special internet portals where people could copying or listening, or watching media content legaly. And nowdays there are some examples of this, like iTunes or Yandex Music. But they are not so comfortable to use as they should.
To conclude, we have the situation when the illegal copying and sharing of the media content is wildspread. Everybody who do this should be punished but in the same time we should find a way to share media with the Internet legaly and in the more comfortably.
