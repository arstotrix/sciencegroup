The graph chart illustrates us the amount of people who use different social sites such as Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn devided into groups by the users' age.

To begin with, let me describe some features that all of these networks have. Facebook and Instagram are more used by people whose age is 18-29, while LinledIn is not very popular among people of this age category. Talking about a little bit older users (30-49), for instance, they prefer to use LinkedIn rather then Instagram and FaceBook, because they are in a first position of all the user's category in LinkedIn. Furthermore, all the sites has in comon is the fact that people by the age 65+ illustrate the minor part of users in each social network. While the age category of people who is 50-64 years old is on the third place on such sites as Instagram and Facebook, but, talking about LinkedIn, this part of users do place on the second layer.

Summing all the information up, it is clear that the younger part of adults do prefer to use more "teenage" and informal Instagram, while older and more serious people use LinkedIn, which, as we all know, can perfectly help you with your career.
