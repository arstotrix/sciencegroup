The charts show the percentage of white and non-white general and imprisoned population.
The overall trend is that in both the UK and the USA there are more white people than non-white among those who are not kept in prison (88% in the UK and 64% in the USA), while only a small minority of the UK's non-white people is not in prison and in the USA approximately a third of non-white people is not in prison.
However, the situation is different with the prison poplulation. In the UK there is a big gap in percentage of white and non-white imprisoned people (74% of white people and 26 % of non-white people), while in the USA the percentage of non-white people in prison (67%) outweighs the percentage of white people in prison (33%).
All in all, it is clear from these bar charts that the situation with general population is the same in both countries, whereas there is a huge difference in the percentage of white and non-white prison poplulation in the UK and the USA.
