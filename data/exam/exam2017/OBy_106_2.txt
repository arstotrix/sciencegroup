Nowadays pirate copies make musicians and film producers lose a lot of money. Should people who copy and share music or films on the internet be punished?

Of course people who work in music or film industry get a huge amount of money from selling their production. But no one exept them won’t feel bad if copying and sharing music or films become legal. In my opinion, the government should allow pirate files in Internet as there are many people who cannot buy the original discs and use Internet to listen to music or to watch film.

On the other hand, musicians can make money on concerts and producers can have money from selling merchandise. Despite the fact that there are a large number of pirate copies, I think that it is not a large problem, because a lot of people still go to cinema and buy CD discs. For example, the sites like Kinopoisk.ru show that a lot of people prefer to go to the cinema instead of watching film at home. So producers got their money back. Of course if pirate sistem doesn’t exist they can earn much more but I consider that they have enough money. The same situation with musicians. For instanse, the famouse Russian singer Shnurov takes for the ticket to his concert at least 3 thouthands rubles. He always connects a lot of people at large stadiums. So I am sure that he is not against the pirate copies of his music in Internet. 

In conclusion I want to write that I am strongly believe that people who download pirate files should not be punished as musicians and producers can get money from other parts of their production. And should remember that many people from all over the world still use the cinema and like to listen music on discs.
