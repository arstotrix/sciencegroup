Nowadays, the question about influence of drugs on sportsmen life's is oftenly discussing. Such opinion that athletes who using illegal drugs should be banned from competing for some limited period exists. There is another theory that such athletes should be banned for the rest of their lives. It is really try to decide which opinion is more powerful.
Some people believe that banning athlets from competing for ever is unfair. Person could have hard problems, also sportsmen are always in great emotional and nervous situations. So, if human have done a mistake it should not cost a career for him. Moreover, after some medical and psychology treatment athlet can work and compete in the same way.
However, others suppose that using illegal drugs in sport competitions is strictly not allowed. Athletes using drugs help themselves to be more strong and quick due to medical technology and it is unfair and unprofessionally. Besides, people using drugs usually become addictive and it is a medical problem closing the way to professional sport. Also, sometimes using hard drugs causes traumas and illnesses which can even kill sportsmen.
In my personal opinion athletes caught using illegal drugs should be banned from competing professionally for ever, because it is dangerous for themselves. It is important to say that sport demonstrates human skills and abilities and with using drugs it is just medical and pills competition, so sport just loses it's meaning. Althought, such hard questions should be discusse in professional area using rules and justice.
