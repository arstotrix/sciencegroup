The modern society is facing with crimes every day and do not even notice this fact.
Moreover, the police sometimes is not that reliable as we really want it to be. So, how can we reduce the amount of crimes?
Some people claim that giving longer prison sentences will be helpfull.In my opinion, it does not. However, if a person would be in prison for a longer period, he/she always had a chance to do the same crime again when he revealed. So, these people are concerned that being in prison helps people not to do crimes again.I do not really think so. For instance, there are a lot of junkies in hip-hop culture that were in prison and after their revealing begin to do it even more often, sometimes these drug dealers are making their buisness even in prison.

On the other hand, there are some people who think in other way. They believe that there are alternative ways of dicreesing crimes in our society. To my mind, these people are right.
What can we do with these prisoners. Of course, there are always been social works and other ways to make these people obey the law. Personally I belive that to reduce crimes we need to manage prisoners with some interesting to them things. For example, one of the most famous rappers in the USA called Pusha T was a cocain dealer in his youth, but after being included in hip-hop culture he stopped all of his buisness and began to motivate young people not to bound into drug industry.

In conclusion I would like to say that almost all of the prisoners have some phycological problems. That is why we need to be not only humans, we need to show the humanity. How can we manage to do it? In my point of view we need to immerse these people in some of the activities which would be convenient to them.
