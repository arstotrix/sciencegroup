It is widely believed that illegal copies of films and music makes its original creators lose a lot of money annually. People who listen to and watch these copies are also crimers. I don’t support this idea because people downloadin illegal files just use free information from the internet.
First of all, illegal pirates copying these files should be punished. I agree that sharing music or films in such way is crime. It can be compared with burglary. But people consumed these files just download it like any othe free information in the Internet. For example, I often listen to music in social networks and sometimes I even don’t know that it’s downloaded illegaly. So it’s quite difficult to identify illegal copy.
Secondly, I believe that it is more rational to punish illegal pirates. Moreover, I consider musicians and filmproducers should save and protect their files more accurately. I think strictly control in cinemas wouldn’t allow pirates to copy films. Musicians should keep songs in secrets from everyone before it release. Nobody mustn’t have access to it.
Thirdly, to prevent illegal copying creators can make original disks cheaper. So, people will have an incentive to buy original record and listen or watch it in good quality. For example, it is cheaper to buy the disk for 150 ₽ than to watch a bad copy of film.
Taking everything into account, it must be said illegal pirates are really theives but not ordinary people. Internet users just consume the information and files from the Internet sometimes even not knowing that it was copying illegaly.
