Nowadays crimes are the part of our everyday life, we can face it wherever. Especially, there are more and more young people, who are involved in different crimes. It can be due to vary reasons.
From my point of view, it can be caused by living in poverty and in bad housing conditions, young people start to steal a little bit from shops and then do it more and more often, because they want to eat or buy something that they need, but do not much money to buy it themselves. Another reason can be misunderstanding of the consequences, they are young and have no idea about jail at all, for example. They commit crimes sometimes just for fun with their friends and do not think about the consequents.
I strongly believe that parents and teachers can warn young people from those crimes, if they start it in childhood in right way. Parents should tell their children why it is bad and what they must not do. It can be not in a serious way, but it should be in every family. Parents should look for their children and take care of them every minute, child should feel it. In teacher’s turn they should discuss problems of crimes during their studies, children should be ready for life without any participation in crime. There are a variety of legitimate methods of earning money.
In conclusion I would like to say that currently young people’s crimes is very serious problem and we should with all the forces try to solve this problem.
