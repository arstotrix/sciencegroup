We have two graphics, which show us the population in the USA and birth and death rate from 1750 to 2000.
As we can see in the first graph, the growth of the USA population gradually rise. Besides, during the last part of the 20th century, there are was more intensive growth. That is probably means that there were more babies born or people immigrated to the USA.
The second graph shows us that during all this period birth and death rates were not stable.There was a pick of birth and death activity during the second part of 18th century, after that the graphs gradualy fall. For the last 50 years of the 20th century the number of deaths is stable, while the births are growing. 	If we compare this two graphs we can make a conclusion that the sharp increase of population is mostly caused by newcomers, who moved to the USA after The Second World War.
