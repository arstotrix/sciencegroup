The chart represents the main trend in developing of the book market in four countries in 2014 and 2018.
To start with, it is clearly seen from the chart that in the USA all figures is going to be changed dramatically in four years. Printed books lost its positions in 2014, meanwhile eBook shoots up dramatically in 2018. In comparison, in the UK both figures of printed books and eBook just slightly change and stay almost on the same positions.
Secondly, in Germany and China the usage of printed books doesn't really change. In Germany the numbers remain stable and in China there also no immenselly jumps of figures.The same about eBooks in these two countries. The numbers stay almost on the same posts.
To sum up, the forecast for 2018 shows that eBook will become more popular than in 2014. Although in China and in Germany there are not going to be any serious changes in developing of eBooks, there still some little tendency for it.
