I adopt an opinion that the main problem of the people is they themselves. Interestingly there is not any kind of animal that would have problem with its natural environment. Nowadays, the mankind is in a rather hard situation. I think the most problems comes from unconsciosness of most people, either governments and citizens. A number of governments want to start the wars between them. It creates a lot of problems to the people. Apart from it a lot of people on the world want to get the money more than anything in this life. It is also the source of many troubles, because their main motivations is not the happiness of another people.
I do not understand, how we can think about the space exploration looking on the range of all these troubles wich come from ourselves. I do not know a lot of in the science of the space, but it seems very hard for me to believe that the space exploration can solve these problems. I think we should attempt to stop doing all these stupid things and explain to all people of the world and to the next generation. If all the people would just understand these issues and start to do only right things, a lot of problems will disappear in a moment. After it the next generation can explore the space and go to another planet with much more wonderfull plans for life. But if we will not solve our problems and will go to another planet, the problems will not go on, they will remain with us. So this is not a real solution for us. And all people should understand that only people can solve the people's problems.
