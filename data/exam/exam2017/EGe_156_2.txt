Recently some countries have become concerned about the invention of a system which could provide people with guaranteed income. Some people may argue such a system can be beneficial for the society, while others believe it may be even harmful. I suppose this issue requieres more careful consideration.

On the one hand, if a "Guaranteed basic income" system is organised, it will have certain advantages. Firstly, every person will be prevented from absolute poverty, as they will receive minimal income on a monthly basis.For instance, they can spend this money to buy products or to pay for rent. Secondly, such an idea will be beneficial for home-staying mothers, especially for those who are the only breadwinners in the family, because they sometimes struggle to find a job. Furthermore, this system is to help elderly people and teenagers to become more independent from other members of their family.

On the other hand, when people receive money regardless of the situation, they may face several problems. First of all, the government will need to increase taxes to compensate the money which were spent from the budget. Moreover, people might feel deprived of the impulse to find a job or a better job, as they will be financially secure. Nevertheless,the desire to improve the quality of life usually maintaines the same level in any society.

To conclude, although implemention of this system may have several drawbacks, it is likely to provide citezens with a necessary sum of money, which sometimes can save their lives and even make them better. Therefore, I suppose advantages of this system will outweigh the drawbacks.
