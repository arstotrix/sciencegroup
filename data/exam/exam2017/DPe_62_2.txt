Nowadays a lot of music files and films are downloaded on the internet. Because of it many musicians and film producers lose huge number of money. Some people believe that man who download these files is a thif and should be punished. But others claim that it is normal nowadays.
I agree that downloading films and music on the internet instead of buing it is illigal. Producers and musicians invest a lot of money and force for it. It is their job and it is unnormal that they cannot get money from sales their disks. Moreover, stolling on the internet can conduct to stolling in real life. Children can think that it is usual to get something without paying. Maybe punishing can change this filthy situation. Why some people get money for their labour and others not?
On the other hand, sometimes prices for films, music and other files is really huge. If I want to watch film I must have money. But if I have not it I can lose a lot of information (in situation with films) and it can badly influence on me and my relations with other people. Moreover, it is possible that people do it because they do not know for what exactly they pay. I mean, it is quite strange to pay money for film which will be closen after ten minutes.
In addition, I believe that, on the one hand, coping and sharing music and films on the internet should be punished (but not hard) because of forces and souls which were expended on creating films and music. But on the other hand, punishing can has bad influence on fans and their love to art.
To sum up, it is not easy to choose one side. But I agree with people who against the punishing because it has more disadvantages than advantages.
