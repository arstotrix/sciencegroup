The internet saves our lives every day. We can find everything there from information about subject to personal life of our favorite actor, singer. Moreover, it became very easy to download films from the internet for free and do not go to the cinema and spend your money.
There is two sides of this problem. Let is start with point where I agree with statement that people who copying films in the cinema and then download it in different sites like torrent where you can save it on your computer for free should be punished. Of course, it is bad for producers, singers and for group that cover the music, do some effects and etc. They started this business to get money but when you download it for free they lose them. The same situation if you work hard on your job and someone come to you and steal your money. Overall, if you be punished you have to pay some big amount or go to prison.
On the other side people who “theft” music and films help everyone. Not everyone has money, they do not allow themselves to go to the cinema or buy discs with music. As for me, it really helps. I have special app on my phone where I can downlod the music. Pay nothing or pay 1000 rubles per month. If you skiped the movie that you really wanted to see, you will not go to the shop and buy disc you will ask your friend or you can do it by yourself and download it on computer
In conclusion it can be said that people who download music and films without asking the authors should not be punished.
