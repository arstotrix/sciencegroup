These days the situation in the sphere of producing goods is quite tense and difficult, as some large businesses are getting more and more powerful and competitive, whereas small family businesses are losing their customer base due to their inability to compete with large international brands and labels. In this essay I will discuss both advantages and disadvantages of this situation.
The most obvious drawback of local businesses is the fact that they cannot provide enough working places for people in need. Because of such situation the level of economics in the particular region declines. For example, in small Russian villages it is far better to build a chain store of large international brand than local family shop, as citizens will get more working places with higher salaries.
On the other hand the development of small businesses has its bright sides and benefits. Nowadays, it is a widespread thing, that goods produced in local markets are often better than in popular chain stores, as small businesses are more customer-oriented. For instance, it is better to buy dairy products at the small farmer shop, than in a big supermarket, as food will be fresher and tastier .Moreover, these local businesses and small shops are just more pleasant places to visit, as they treat their customers differently. Each customer will receive enough help and attention, and, probably, will feel himself as a part of the family. In many local shops assistants know each customer personally and know their specific needs, so they can satisfy these needs easier.
To conclude, despite the fact that small businesses have some drawbacks, it is essential to help them to develop, as they often produce far better goods for consumers.
