The bar chart illustrates the distribution of adult users in the USA by age group according to the use of three social networks, namely: Facebook, Instagram and LinkedId.

Overall, the most striking feature is that LinkedIn is used mainly by people aged 30-49, while both Facebook and Instagram are more popular among people aged 18-29.

As it is illustrated, the percentage of those people, aged 18-29, who use Facebook comprises 87%, which makes Facebook the most popular social network. Considering the proportion of people, aged 30-49, 50-64 and 65+, the figures do not vary dramatically, with 73%, 63 and 56% respectively. Regarding Instagram, it is obvious that it repeats the same pattern with the highest percentage of young (aged 18-29) online users, which makes up 53%. However, the figures for all the other age groups are poor, with 25%, 11% and 6% respectively.

As for LinkendIn, it is shown that the proportion of users, aged 30-49, is quite similar to the adults aged 50-64, with 31% and 30% respectively. Moreover, the percentage of users, aged 18-29 and 65+, stands at 22%.
