It is clear that musicians and film producers lose a gradually value of their money from illegal pirate copies every year. But often people can’t buy a disk, because they have a little money, and disks can crash after some times of using. So I think that it’s nor very well, but it’s true a way for this people. And I agree with them.

But! People downloads copies of films in their computers, but the can often go to the cinema, because there are many films look like so good and cool on the big (экран?). And often a lot of money comes to the cassa, and they a piese of this money go to the authors of this films. And people often buy disks, if they have special.
