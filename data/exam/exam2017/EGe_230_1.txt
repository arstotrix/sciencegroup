The charts shows us goods transportation by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in the year 2008.
On the first chart pie we can see the most persentage of metals about 35%, then by the same time on road it is involved only 11%. the second place by rail's good took manufactured goods, it had 25%, by the road this persenatage is higher - 28%. we can see significantly diference by food products between road (30%) and rail ( 11%). Another one important difference consist in chemicals (11% by rail and 16% by road) and machinery (about 12% transpoted's goods and just 2% by road's goods). and the last one is non-metallic minerals, which had more on road (13%) and double less by rail.
in conclusion, we need to say, that no more than one thing, which is manufactured goods, doesn't have the similary factors.
