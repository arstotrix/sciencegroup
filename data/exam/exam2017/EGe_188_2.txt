We can see in our country that people prefer American and British movies rather than Russian ones. The similar situation is present in other non-English speaking countries. I think that it is provoked by a number of reasons. Firstly, the quality of American and British movies is undoubtfuly higher and people choose the best. Hollywood has a rich history of cinematograph and people there khow how to produce films well and earn money. The technologies there are more developped.
The second reason is that English is an international language and unify people all over the world. Should governments give more financial support to local film industries? We know that Russian government try to support our producers. For example, "Fond Kino" gives a lot of money to produce Russian films and I think it is a good way to stimulate Russian film-makers. On the other hand, we can see also persons who получает this finacial support and the films they product. Its quality does not grow (may be the reason is that they want just to earn miney and corruption); producers who have been appreciated by the world (for example, Alexander Sokurov) can not produce their films in Russia and look for other investment. The facts make people disappoint in Russian movies and doubt in justice of fond's decisions, that's why people does not to bring them miney in cinema and just to watch their films. This is the last evident reason of unpopularity of locally produced films.
To conclude, I think that government has to support local producers. That will motivate small but talented producers to create good films and will develop lical film indystry.
