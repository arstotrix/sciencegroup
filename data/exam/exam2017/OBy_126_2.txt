In my opinion, music and films are the pieces of art. Nowadays the majority of people choose copy or download them for free, instead of buying the original discs, because of the big price. And most of us think, why we should spend so much money for art?

Most people would accept that today the musicians and film producers make a huge prices for there works. And most of us do not understand, why it is so expensive. Because music and films should improve your mind, by causing an emotions. 

Art can induce aversion, incomprehension, stupor or fear, especially modern component. And most of us would agree that this is all because of artists, who learned how to convey to the masses their vision. And art must always be a cause of any persons emotions, But how it can rise any emotions if you have not money for it.

In conclusion, I would say that art, such as music and films, can expand your horizons about life and the world generally by improving your skills, capabilities, intelligence and mind. It will make you feel reality better, sometimes by strange methods, but it will be a cause of variety of your emotions. So it needs to be free for all of us.
