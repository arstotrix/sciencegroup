It is commonly known that in modern world problem of crime is very widespred especially among young generation. More and more illegal affairs are commited by youngsters every day. What actions can people take to reduce the crime rate? In this essay I will discuss some causes and possible solutions.

There is no doubt that there are different causes of this problem. However, the first one is the lack of different activity among young people. Unfortunately, they have too much spair time and nothing to do with it.The second problem is in the sphere of mass media. Nowadays, a lot of films and social networks propogate such cruel lifestyle and make it fashionable to be a "bad boy".Another reason may be connected with drug addiction which is very common for this generation. That means when people have no money for drugs they begin to search these money by all possible ways and the easiest one is to commit a crime.

Beyond all doubts, the first thing that parents and teachers can do is to involve their children and pupils in different activities like sports, music,art and so on, in that way they will not have enough time even to think about the crime. Secondly, parents should check periodically the interests of their children and not aloud to watch too cruel movies in very young age. Finally, the problem of drugs is the most serious one, so children should have regular chekups in the hospital and they should be awared by parents and teachers how dangerous for life such addiction can be.

To sum it up, the main reason for commiting a crime seems to be the lack of attention to children from parents and teachers. People grown up in love are less involved in the illegal actions.
