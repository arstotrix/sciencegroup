Today we live in an open world. Almost all information is open and available in the Internet. Due to this openess people is highly affected by popular trends and people in Internet. In my opinion exactly this usually harmful effect can be a cause of “young crimes”.
Of course, internet is one of the greatest tool for making a business, providing any reseach, or even just for fan and relax. Unfortunately, it has also much harmful, crazy for educational people content. For example, I have seen the group in popular social network, VK, it was something like privat club for young people. If you wanted to enter this club you would should to record a video with your falling on behind a car on a roade. This is absolutely unacceptable. Young people are easily affected by others, even if it a dangerous, and can be cause of some crimes.
To prevent this trend, young people should be barried from this content by their parents. There are two ways. The first one is strict, parents can download a program on children devices. It will block some site. This way may create some dificulties in family relationships. The second one is better but much more difficult. Parent’s can explain their children about all consequences from harmful trend.
To summarize, the most likely cause of trend, that young people committed more crimes than ever before is an Internet crazy and harmful content. The best way to solve this problem is an explaination about every dangerous consequences of following harmfull trends from parents to their children.
