The line graphs compare levels of average temperatures (the smallest and highest) in two areas (Yakutsk in Russia and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil) over a period one year.
as can be seen from the figures, the lowest grade is in July in Rio de Janeiro and it is just under than 20. Hovewer, the ninimum tempetature is less on approximately 60 grades in January in Russia (nearly -40). This rate is similar with December in Yakutsk.In addition to this, the smallest temperature in Rie de Janeiro is similar with the highest grads in Yakutsk and this number is 25.
On the other hand, the maximum temperature is in January and in February in Brazil which attaches 30. Different results are in Russia. This country has well under than 30 in July.
Thus, the graphs illustrate strong evidence that both towns have absolutly different rates of temperatures. More than that, Rio de Janeiro does not have the temperatures with minus in contrast to Russia. Furthermore, the everage grads are almost equal in Rio de Janeiro but there is big fluctuating in Yakutsk.
