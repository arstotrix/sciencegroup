Recently, the cinamotograph provides our a lot of new films with different kinds of genre. Undoubtedly, the main part of this product made by British and United Kingdom of America. It goes without saying that it is enough popular amoung teenagers and adults people. I will try to explain why.
Firstly, the modern films fits the requirement of population. People need more expression and bright emotions. Therefore, the cinema give them such product as action movies, horrors and drama. Moreover, the ideas and conception about arts has changed. In modern world people have an aspiration to self-develop and a lot of talent and creativity. So they make the masterpieces which others people like because they also have this pursuit. Secondly, British and USA have the rich money source. Therefore, films of these countries significally better than products of other countries. Such films as British and Usa films have the great quality. It consists the grafics, actors, montage and etc. So it is the one of the important reason why many people to prefer foreign films rather than locally produced films. In addition, the huge sums of money spend on the design and marceting in order to attract people in cinema. Therefore, people see the beautiful posters, buy the tickets and go to the cinema.
I strongly agree with the idea that governments should more financial support to own films. However, in my opinion, this support should be strict, because a lot of unquality and full films are displayed at the cinema, while the useful and quality films have not famous. I consider that is unfair. Actually, the cinematograph is the part of national culture. Therefore, the culture advancement leads to average well-being of population. Also film industries has an influence on international relationship. So I have the standpoint that goverments should participate in financial support to local film industries.
