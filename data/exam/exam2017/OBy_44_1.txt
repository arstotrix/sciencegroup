The pie charts illustrates how goods were transported between Europe countries in 2008 by rail and road.

As we could see the persentage of transported chemicals is almosm equal, 11% by rail and 16% by road. That also stands by Manufactured goods, which difference counted just 3 per cent. By the contrast other goods had absolutely different results. For example, the percentage of machinery goods transportated by rail were over 10 per cent, when the same goods transportated by road counted just 2 per cent. Moreover the biggest difference was between transportation by metals, 35 per cent by rail and 11 per cent by road. Almost the same trend we could see on Food products parts, but there the biggest percentage of that goods which was transportated by road, was 30 per cent. Finally, we pay attention for non-metallic minerals, which difference is a bit bigger more than a half â€“ 6 per cent by rail and 13 percent by road.
