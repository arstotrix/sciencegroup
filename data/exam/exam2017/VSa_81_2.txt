In recent years the problem of illegal drugs in sport has become very acute. The fact is, two points of view on this situation exists some people believe that athletes who used illegal drugs should be banned from profession competitions for a limited period (i.e. 2 years). Others are sure that such sportsmen should be banned for the rest of their lives. This essay will examined both points of view carefuly.
Personally I believe that athletes cought using illegal drugs should be punished by banning from competing professionally for no more then 2 years. Firstly, it is obviously for me that stricter punishment may be too cruel and violent. We cannot prohibit a sportsman to promote the deed of his life. Secondly, I believe that this ban will help to make the person better and this sportsman will not try illegal drugs anymore.
Anyway, there are a lot of people who do not share this point of view. They argue, that people do not change. The athlete who tried illegal drug one time would do another time. The second vital idea is that such violent punishment as prohibition to compete professionally during the rest of the life will stop other athletes from competing unfair. The fact is, one example may show what can occure, if you break the rules.
To conclude, I would like to say, that the problem of punichng the athletes, caught using illegal drugs is very actual and acute. In my opinion, such sportsmen should be banned for a limited period, because stricter punishment may be too violent and do not stop other athletes from breaking the prohibition.
