Nowadays the problems of copying and sharing the illegal pirate versions of music in internet is really widespread. Many people, who download thees files is punished. I agree that this category of people should be arested.
First of all, people do this punishment without telling to autor of original music. Follow, the autor doesn’t where his music is located. Secondly The pirate copies can used by people in many places likes restorants and other can think that it is original.
 On the other hand, copying and sharing music of films on the internet makes it more popular and famous. Moreover, autors of music and film can became really good and famous person. 
To continue arguments of discussion there are many people, who download pirate files by buying the original discs. They spend money for this and after that they do sharing for free. However, it doesn’t compare with losing huge amounts of money every years by producers they. They lose money because pirate copies is selled and people buy it.
To conclude the argument of essay, people who donload pirate illegal files of musics and films etc, should be punished because these people do unlaw things. Moreover, they ignore the law about intellectual promity.
