Musicians and film producers lose a big part of money every year because of illegal pirate copies. Everybody knows that copying and sharing such art products is a crime. Should people who break the law in such way be punished? In my opinion there is no right answer on this question. I can’t be only agree or disagree with it.

On the one hand we have producers, whose payment addicts from number of people, who buy their work. For example, some producer has a film. If every person would watch the film in an illegal way, for example, download in from torrent sites, the producer will have no money, Secondly, when people copying and download films in Internet, they break author’s rights. In this case people should be punished.

On the other hand, we have people, who don’t have enough money to pay for films. Imagine that there is some man, who loves cinema art with all his heart. He wants to watch every film from Cannes festival, but it’s not possible, because there are too many films and he can’t pay for each, because, in my opinion, ticket’s price is very high. That’s why this man download film from Internet. It will be not fair to punish him, because he just doing something that makes him happy.

In conclusion, I want to say that nowadays we faced a real problem with illegal pirate copies. I believe that there will be found a solution of these problem to make producers not to lose their money because of pirate-copies-thief and for art-lover not to break the law.
