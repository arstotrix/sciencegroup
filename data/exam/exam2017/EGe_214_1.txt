The graph shows the average time spent on sport activities by inhabitans of England in 2012. The data is sorted by age and gender.
To start with, it is extremely noticeably that men from 16 to 24 years old did sport the most. The time they spent doing exercises reached 282,1 minutes. For comparison, women from 16 to 24 spent 114,1 minutes on sport. However, this number is the highest for women's sport activity, so it is clearly that young people in England were the most sporty persons in 2012 and it does not matter are we talking about men or women. As well as younger people were sporty, the oldest were non-sporty: men and women over 75 together spent less time doing sport than one of seven part of time which men in age group 16-24 did. There is also a fact that men did sport and exercise more than women.
As it has mentioned before, men did sport more than women. Nevertheless, not in all ages. For instance, women in age group 55-64 spent more time on sport than men: 55,4 minutes versus 52,7.
