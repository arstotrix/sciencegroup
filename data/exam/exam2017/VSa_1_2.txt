In today's world the use of tecnology is ever increasing. I totally agree that the widespread of modern tecnology can effect on number of healt problems.
Firstly, almost every family has their private TV. The programs can be received anywhere in the world, on your smartphone, notebook, etc. Our eyes are overloaded by the number of received information.
Secondly, the increased number of cars, that produce dangerous wastes like carbon dioxide and so on. It can create a huge number of proplems with our lungs, because of heavy metals in the air. Also the radiation level in the subway can be the reason of human illness.
