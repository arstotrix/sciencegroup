The statement that more crimes are being commited by young people is not absolute. While it may be true that the number of crimes increases, but the significance decreases.
Nevertheless, it still remains a problem for society if youngers tend not to follow the the rules. In my opinion, unsufficient attention is the cause of it. First of all, parents should spend more time with children even if they are usually busy at work. A child need someone who he or she will perceive as an example of good behavior. It is great if he or she has one and it means a child will copy good behavior and get knowledge about ethics.
But there is a significant drawback in this point of view. What if parents work all week and simply do not have a lot of spare time for children? Because of that teachers in schools should also take responsibility for children in their classes. But it also require teachers to have high moral standarts.
Both parents and teachers should teach children how to be responsible. It means that they should understand that every action has consequences. It means parent and teachers should pay attention to the successes but at the same time they shoulde strick if a child did something bad. In this situation they would motivate children to be better and prevent them from bad behaviour.
I believe that behaviour of young people depends on how they grew up. And that is the reason I think that parents and teachers are able to influence teens and it is the most sufficient way to struggle with increasing number of crimes committed by young people.
