The diagram represents the popularity of three social networks among four age groups. The vertical axis demonstrates the percentage, whereas the verical one depicts the names of the networks.

Facebook can be called the most popular, as more than half of people within every age group prefers it. Its audience is dominated by young adults aged from 18 to 29, but the proportion of older users is only slightly lower.

In case with Instagram the discrepancy is more significant. This network is also dominanted by young adults, who make half of the audience, whereas the proportion of their older counterparts barely reaches the qurter for those aged from 30 to 49 and is even lower for the rest of the participants.

LinkedIn is drastically different from the abovementioned platforms, as its target audience consists mainly of users aged from 30 to 64.

All in all, the age correlation is not even in all of the networks in question, what can be explained by the goal of each site.
