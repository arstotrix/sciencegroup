Nowadays there are a lot of legal drugs which are used by professional sportsmen. However, sometimes athletes use the illegal ones that lead to disqualification of the athletes for a long, but limitted period of time. Some people argue that these sportsmen must be excluded from competitions for the rest of their lives. Now I try to discuss both views.
To begin with, the amount of illegal drugs has increased over time. Thus, many athletes are not aware of it and they continue to consume illegal drugs as usual things. For example, we know a lot of cases than the group of people who run large competion passed a strict law about new illegal drugs. So, many competitors cannot go to this contest. However, others say that athelets should know about the changes of reglament.
Secondly, every situation is special. So, I think that every illegal act of athlete should be looked separately. Nevertheless, there are must be one union law for all sportsmen.
Thirdly, sometimes using of illegal drugs is necessary for athletes.
In conclusion, I would like to say that using of illegal drugs is offense, but every case is particular. And in my opinion athletes should not be banned from competitions for the rest of their lives.
