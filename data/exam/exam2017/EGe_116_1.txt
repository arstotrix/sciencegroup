The given bar chart illustrates the changes which book market faced in 2014 and will propably face in 2018 in such four countries as the USA, Germany, China and the UK.
As can be clear from the chart, in 2014 the USA got 10,5 billion US dollars from selling printed books, which was the largest sum of money among all figures whereas in 2014 the UK got only 2,6 billion US dollars on selling printed books, that is the lowest feature respectively.

According to the graph, the USA sold almost five times as many printed books as the UK in 2014. Then, 1 billion US dollars will probably be realized because of selling e-books in Germany and China as well. Aditionally, the selling of printed books will sharply fall down from 2014 to 2018 (five times) unlike the situation with print books in Germany, where the selling of such kind of books from 2014 to 2018 remaines stable in this country.
Overall, as can be read from the bar chart, the sellings of all types of books wiil possibly decrease rapidly at around 4,5 times.
