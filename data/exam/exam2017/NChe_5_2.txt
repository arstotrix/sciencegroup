We are living in 21th centery, in world where technology is developing and upgrading with rapid speed. People argue that widespread of use modern techology is causing health problems. I partly agree with statement and have seveval evidence to support my point of view.
First of all, modern technology like TV, computers and smart phones can cause some health prombles, if we use them for long time. For example children are in stage of developing and their organies developing are not finished. So, the usage during long periods electronic gadgets will cause problems in eyes and in health in general, because they will have lack of exercise. On the other hand it may be sovled with parent's contvoll in time of usage.
However, I want to underline the idea that modern techology in some area like medicene help us stay in healthy and cope with some illness. For example smart chain helps us check our body if we have some problems with health and gives note what to do. Smart watches are not only used by programms, but its also can check our pulse by mesuaring with magnette dots on it and send information to hospital. Thanks to these technologies doctors can check our health status online and in emergency situation pick up patient to hospital.
To sum up widespread use of modern technology might cause some health problems, but if we will use them properly we can avoid. Also modern technology help us being healthy and check our body status.
