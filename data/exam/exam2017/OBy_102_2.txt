It is the truth that musicians and film producers can’t get full income from selling their works because of the pirate files growing on the internet field every minute. 

I agree that and disagree with this statement at the same time. From one point of view, art people can protect their author rights, because they involve a lot of power and time creating masterpieces, from which depends their financial status. On the other hand, I think that musicians and film producers must realize that art is non commercial by nature and give not only money, but such things like self realization. Moreover, art creatures is the main source of human lightuing and selfeducation. Parafrase, they must be responsible of impact on people, and if the masses accept and promote artworks, that indeed means promotion of the creator, it must reveal only good feelings. What  comes to me, I can’t always permit to myself buying some album or film that’s why I use illegal files from the Internet like all people.
