Nowadays it is very popular to copy and share stolen music and films on the internet and there are a lot of people who download such files instead of buying the original discs and cassets. Therefore, musicians, movie producers lose huge parts of income every year because of illegal practicies, so there is an opinion that people who download pirate copies should be punished.
First of all, there are some arguments against this point of view. Firstly, a lot of people just do not have so much money to pay for every disc with new song or film and the only solution for them is to download pirate copies. Secondly, practicies can be beneficial for musician: information about him or her, his song are spread through the internet and his popularity grows up. Last but not least, a lot of people simply do not know that they download illegal pirate files so it is hard to blame them.
However, there are some people who agree with this opinion and believe that punishement for downloading pirate copies should be. First of all, they claim that a lot of films do not receive a great popularity in cinemas just because of possibility to watch them on the internet illegally. Secondly, pirate copies usually have bad quality and viruses inside them, which can lead to breakaning computers and stealing money and personal information. Thirdly, if one does not know the laws it does not mean that he should be considered as innocent.
All in all, one should keep in mind these arguments and remember that, despite the advantages of downloading pirate copies, such practicies are formally illegal.
