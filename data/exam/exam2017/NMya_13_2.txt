One of the most disturbing and dangerous social trends today is rise in the amount of crimes commited by young people. It is important to understand how to fight it, and that is why we need to point out the possible reasons of the trend.
First of all, the modern world is largely urbanized. And with urbanization, the era of traditional families passes, giving a way to nuclear modern-type families.
Many of the latter have a single child, and contact with their relatives rarely. As a result, children from these families might not have a close person – that is, a sister, a brother or a grandparent, - to interact with and develop socially. This may give a life to mental problems, making a person socially dangerous.
Another reason behind these crimes may be the rosen popularity of the Internet. Without any doubt, there are plenty of benefits provided by the Internet, such as an ability to communicate with people across a sea, learn almost any information and read any book. Yet, the sense of being connected to the whole world makes a person vulnerable to the words of people trying to verbally offend them, and that may be a motivation for commiting a hate crime, especially if you are young and expressive.
How can the society try to solve this problem? To soften the negative effects that I have written about above, the following could be done.
First teachers at school should be observing closely each child’s psychological state to give them any needed support. Secondly, the parents need to pay close attention to what their children watch and read, on the Internet and beyond, to save them from negative impacts.
Fighting against crimes, it is important to remember to care about people who can potentially commit it.
