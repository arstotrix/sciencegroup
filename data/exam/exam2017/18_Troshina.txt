The government of the countries concider that they only need to produce the products which their population eats, and should aim to import less. And I want to discuss about it in that essay. I believe that it’s really important to use products which make in your country. It’s not just about food, but about some electronic, cars and smth else. For example, in the USSR was the ideal situation. There were not import, but people were happy and they were not feel deficit. People of our country made all products and food by themselvs. And that is why the USSR was the greatest country in the world with ideal economic. But there were some technologies which the soviet worker wasn’t learn. That is why we import some food from the other countries. But in Russia the situation is else. We import almost every product. Our fields is empty. Our country has the biggest size, but we don’t use it. Because of that a lot of people, who work in the USSR on the fields, haven’t job now. But population need food and the lonely method to get food is buy it from other countries. Exactly that is why a lot of people haven’t job and the Russia economic on the bottom. But if the government do something to change it, do something to less impor, our economic will get the second life. To sum up I want to say that it’s very important to produce products that their own population eats. It’s save the economic of country and create the work places for people.
