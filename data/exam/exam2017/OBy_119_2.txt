There are different opinions on the problem of downloading films and music from the Internet and sharing them there. Some people believe that it is a crime and those who do not pay money for songs and films should pay a fine. However, I think that it is not a serious crime and these people should not be punished. 

Those people who think that downloading music and film is illegal believe that singers or actors work really hard to make a good song or film. Therefore, they should get money for the job they have done and it is not fait that people use their effort for free. Moreover, people who own and programme wevscites where people can watch songs or listen to music also should get money because it is difficult to make a good website and supervise it.

However, I think that people who download music from the Internet are not criminals and should not be punished, because it is not a theft, as many singers provide free access to their new songs for their fans. Secondly, musicians and actors get a lot of money because they give concerts or producers pat them a lot of money.
