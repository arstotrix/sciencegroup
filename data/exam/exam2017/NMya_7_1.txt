The given diagram represents proportion of people of gifferent ages who use social networks namely Facebook, Instagram, and Linkedin.
The most popular social network in the United States is Facebook. Almost 90 percent of young (18 – 29 y.o.) people use it. In other groups this figure is smaller, but even in the oldest group (65+) Facebook is used by more than a half of people.
Instagram is less popular than Facebook. It is used by 53% of young people, but among elder people this social network is drastically less popular. Only one fourth of 30-49 year old people are active users of Instagram. This proportion reaches it’s bottom among 65+ y.o. people. Only 6% of them have an Instagram account.
Linkedin is a very unusual social network because it has almost constant persentage of users among all groups, which reaches its peak of 31% in 30-49 y.o. group. Young and very old people use Linked in not as frequent as others. May be it happends because lots of them are students or pensioners, so they do not work (and do not use linkedin).
