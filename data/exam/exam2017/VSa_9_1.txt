Concerning the data on railway transportation the biggest proportion is Metals (35%), whereas in road-way transportation it hoped to be 11%. The persent food products transported by road is 30% while only 11% by rail. There is a big difference between rake of Machinery level. 12% goods are transported by rail and only 2% by road. Other good have nearly similar proportion.
The main trend that emerges from the charts is that heavy goods mainly transported by rail (like Machinery and Metals) and small goods transported by road, for example food products.
