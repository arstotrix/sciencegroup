The problem of illegal distribution of intellectual property is nowadays very sharp. Some people even think, that not only distributors, but also consumers of illegal or “pirate” content should be punished. Of course, it’s very difficult problem and we can hardly solve it finally. However, I’m agree with only one part of this statement. It is true, that we should punish people, who illegally copy and share films or music, because it is property and property rights should be protected strictly. However, sometimes a producer of some content leaves it in open access and anyone can download or share it. Consequently, sharing and copying it will not be illegal.
Moreover, another question arises – should we blame or punish consumers of “pirate” content? Should we blame peasants, who get food from Robin Hood? They didn’t steal anything and they had no aim to violate the laws. In addition, practically all modern scientific theories are based on “rationality” of an individual person. Therefore, if he dounloads file of something else, which is in open access on the internet for free instead of buying it for some amount of money (Modern films’ and music album’s cost is rather high, that is another reason why people dounload “pirate” content), should we blame him for rationality.
All in all, the problem of illegal copying and sharing is a lot more complex than some people think. No doubt, people, who violates laws and distribute illegal content should be punished. Anyhow, punishing people, who use this content would be cruel and unfair.
