Lets talk about logistic by rail in Eastern Europe in 2008. As I see from the monogram the main popular product is metal. Second level are taken manufactured goods. Third level is taken by Machinery. And the last  one are chemicals, food products, non-metallic minerals. It shows that for train more actual more heavy products. 

Now we will research another logistic system by road. Of course, the leader of this charts are food products and manufactured goods. On the next stage are chemicals (16%), non-metallic minerals (13%), metal (11%). And the most unnesasery is machinery. The comparisons between road and rail is some goods are more comfortable and practical to transported by rail and som by road, it depends off heavy of  goods. More heave products comportable to transported by rail either by road.
