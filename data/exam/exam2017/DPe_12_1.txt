The percentage of people having no job in 5 parts of the world in 2 years can be seen in the diagram.
The total unemployment rate around the world did not change in 2015 in comparison with 2014: it remains 5,9% of the total world population. There were no changes in North Africa and South Asia: North Africa had the biggest part of population having no job (12,5%), on the contrary, South Asia is a region where the unemployment rate is the lowest in the world.
The states of Middle East and of Latin Amerika managed to decrease the amount of unemployent citizents but unfortunately a growth of the level of unemployment people in Europa can be watched.
To conclude, can be said that the rise of unemployment rate it Europe is the same as its fall in Middle East and in Latin America: thatâ€™s why the total percentage of unemployment people in the world remains the same.
