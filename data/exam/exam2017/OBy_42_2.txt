In our modern life people have a lot of problem with health and wellness. Our world became too fast and people waste their time mostly on job, career and family, and forget about themselvse. 

I think there is a problem number one. I guese that most popular health problem is the depression (or SAD) and humanity don’t know how they have to fight with this problem. For example, my mom has a depression because she works a lot and when she comes home she starts doing a routine house work. She forget about the rest. It’s very important don’t forget about it. She is a breddwinner in my family and this is why she has such health problem like depression, some other sickness with her head.

I think this problem might be solved if people start thinking about yourself and about their feelings and body. Maybe it is a meditation, or hobby. Something that can keep you in your mind. I guess that people mostly have a psychosomatic probleme with health in our modern world. Or they just can’t find time for the rest or going to the doctor.

All in all, I want to say that people have to believe in yourself, take care about yourself and maybe this way will help us to reduce this problem with health. We have to help each other. Maybe it sounds crazy but some people believe in karma, and that the bad thing goes away if you can’t do the bad thing. Maybe they are right. Maybe if people were more open to each other and take care about yourself and about each other, this health problem will be reduced.
