The internet users getting pirate versions of the media product despite paying for the legal ones should also be restricted by the government. I utterly agree with such a point of view.
To begin with, internet piracy belongs to a crimerate. In this way, people who buy it’s production support online robbers and provide them with money. So they become the participants of the illegal act. Moreover, such purchasors increase the social acceptance of these unjustified accidents. So the number of pirates and their clients has been consistently rising.
After that, why should producers invest in media when their profit has been permanently decreasing? In essence, the public just take their money. If such a tendency continues, then people limit their investments, there will appear a lack of financial resources and the quality of products will dramatically drop. This means illegal buyers damage economic and cultural spheres in general.
By the way, nowadays governments tend to start punishing breaking the law online actions. It relates to posts and cites in social networks. Breaking rights of the investors is also a crime. So if the government punishes one illegal actions why doesn’t it do the same to the other. That is ease of unjustice.
All in all, internet users who buy pirate products break the rights of the official dealers and steal their money. It is probable to be a drop of the media industry. So the goverment should follow the justice and support the producers.
