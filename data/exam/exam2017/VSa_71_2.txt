The problem of using illegal drugs is increasingly sufficient for modern-day sport. The decision is should be made: to ban athlets cought using them for a limited time or to definitely exclude them from competitions. This essay will discuss both points of view and find out the most suitable.
To start with, banning athlets for a confined period is obviously more humane. A person caught using prohibited drugs may understand it was awfull and make a remorse. Despite some athlets use them, they apparently need to be tought that it is a serious crime in sports. Sport doctors and other medicine personnel of teams should be blamed for allowing and even not knowing about athlet's illegal drugs using, of course.
However, there are people that think that sports societies should prohibit these athlets for the rest of their lives. This point of view is very strict, althoug the most evident solution to illegal drugs problem is a total ban of persons of such a reprehensible conduct. It may be argued that one who was once caught should be frightened of being caught again - this will predestine that culprit will never attempt to cheat once more. Evidently, the latter statement is fallacious: the one who used a drug in his or her past is likely to do it one more time. The sound argument for banning culpable athlets forever is that sport society needs to be cleaned from those who do not attain sport's moral code. This strict desicion will obviously maintain guaranted level of honest competition.
To conclude, two points of view have been discussed: one was to ban athlets using prohibited drugs for a period of time and other - to disqualificate them for the rest of their career. My opinion is that the latter is, despite being significantly rigid, the best solution to the issue of illegal drugs using. That's why I totally agree with it.
