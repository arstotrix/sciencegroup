Nowadays, youth crime is a significant issue in modern life, often dwellers are afraid just to go for a walk because sometimes it is really dangerous and the biggest threat is teenagers who do crimes without any thoughts about future consiquences.

There are a huge amount of causes why young people do crimes. First of all, I suppose that the main reason why the crime activity develops between teenagers is the lack of attention from their parents and teachers, may be they just want to pay that very attention by doing crimes. For instant, children even can become a murder at the age of 15 because they want to be noticed. I consider that it is really importatnt and grown-ups should help young people who has such thoughts.The second reason is different movies about violence and crime.They give children an understanding about the fact that to be a robber or a murder it is normal and then at the everything will be OK , but it is a movie, in real life it is much more serious.

I really believe that parents and teachers need to fight with these causes for example they should respect the children, try them to understand what is good and bad, pay attention to them to everyone individual method of behavior, especially if young person have some problems in family or at school and also go to psychologist with him and not allow to watch TV being a small child.

In my point of view, I am sure that adults need to help youth to deal with their problems and then I guess the youth crimes will be reduced. Moreover, it is also a duty to the government to help children since they go to school by including a program at school which is about how to behave and make them do different acvivities which take their time and they will not even think about doing something awfull.
