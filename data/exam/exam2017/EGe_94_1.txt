The given bar chart provides the information about the situation on the market of the book un four countries such as USA, Germany,China,Uk in 2014 and with the predictions for 2018.
As can be seen from the bar chart, in most countries exept Germany print books will became less popular in contrast with electronic books.For inctanse,the most bright example of the decrease we can observe in the USA. According to bar chart, the print books will go down for about 3 billion US dollars in 2018 and will reach only 8,5 billion. While in 2014 there were 10,5 billion US dollars of print books.
However, in Germany the amount of US billion dollars for print books will remain stable. As is shown in bar chart, in 2014 there were 6 billion US dollars and the same amount we will have in 2018.
Another intersting feature that can be found is that the amount for billion US dollars for electronic books will go up. The most vivid example for it is USA. The increase will be for about 3 billion of US dollars. However, in other remaining countries the increase will be negligible. For example, in China there were 0,5 billion of US dollars in 2014 and in 2018 there will be only 1 billion of US dollars. Accordingly, the growth will be very slightly and only for half billion.
To draw a conclusion, I would like to say that the predictions about the reduction of popularity of print books will be true for all countries exept Germany and in all countries the ebooks will become popular.This can be the result of such process as globalisation.
