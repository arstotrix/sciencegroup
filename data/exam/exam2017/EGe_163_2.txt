Space exploration is only one way of spending large sums of money. However, there are ongoing debates about whether or not exploring the space is a good way to spend money, if society has many problems of its own.
I do not agree with the opinion that spending money on space is useless. First of all, science in general and particularly the exploring of space can find the solutions for urgent problems on Earth by looking for an alternative places of living, for example. Secondly, money put in this type of research helps scientists understand the processes that are taking place on Earth, which leads to progress that we all want to achieve. It is very important if we want to continue develop and gather knowledge about what is happening around us and, most importantly, why this is happening. Finally, space exploration gives people jobs and careers, as well as any other types of jobs.
Nevertheless, many people have different take on this topic. They think that cutting off money spent on space exploration means that they will be put on solving urgent problems, such as poverty, even though it is not how economy works. Also, they do not see the benefits that space science gives us on solving these environmental issues. However, it is clear that many data about the structure and changes of Earth come directly from work that is being done while researching the space.
Overall, evolution of humankind and solving the problems on Earth can only come hand in hand with the development of science, especially the exploration of space.
