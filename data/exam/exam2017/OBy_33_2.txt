Nowadays there are a lot of people think that using of modern technology can be very damaging for health. I personally agree with this people and I think that using technology can cause a lot of health problems. The most widespread problem is that people become very fat because they sitting in front of TV, computers and gadges all day and donâ€™t do any kinds of sports.  Another problem is that children and young people can loose their eye vision because they sit in front of TV, gadges and computers too. The solution of these two problems is very simple: people must go walk on the fresh air, do some sport and limited themselves of using gadges.

There are a lot of other problems, for example, people become more selfish, rude, their attention at surroundings would become lower but these problems are appears to personal and not cause any health problems.

But some people also think that using technology depends on person and only he watches on his health. It is very strong opinion and, actually, it is very true, but technology in our days become more and more widespread, so people can not stop of using it.

Overall there are a lot of problems with health which is caused by using of technology, but solution of them is very simle.
