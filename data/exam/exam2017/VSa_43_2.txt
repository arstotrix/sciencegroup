In the modern world, it is claimed that technologies might have a negative impact on people's health. However, it cannot be denied that electronic machines may cause health issues. I completely agree with this statement and I would like to express my opinion on this situation.
Firstly, especially young people tend to pass a lot of their time in front of computers playing online games, communicating with friends or simply watching videos and listening to music. These ways of spending time can lead to headaches and decrease teenagers' quality of vision. Secondly, there are a lot of Wi-fi networks all over the world that produce electronic waves. Obviously, this can badly influence our brain and body. Furthermore, people can be stressed if they do not know how to  fix the broken computer that they are working on, which impacts our nerves system and does not let humans' bodies regulate natural processes.
Nevertheless, the world is capable to reduce this affect. For example, people can limit the time working with technology to a few hours per day. Also, all the families can switch off the Wi-fi network during night time. Sometimes if it is possible, humans should have vacations outside and enjoy the nature without using any modern technologies. These ways will help to reduce most of the problems caused by electronic machines.
To conclude, it is worth mentioning that modern technology is very useful and interesting invention of the last centures. In any case, it can be harmful for the health; therefore, people should not forget to take the benefits of it wisely.
