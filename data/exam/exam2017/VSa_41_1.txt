The two pie charts below represent the information about the transportation of goods by rail and road in Eastern Europe in 2008. Overall, it is noticable that the majority of goods for manufacture purposes are mostly transported by rail rather than by road.
As it can be seen from pie charts, about 30% of food is transported by road comparing to 11% by rail. In contrast, only 2% of machinery are transported by road whereas about 12% - by rail. Only manufactured goods have approximately the same proportion in pie charts depicted below (25% and 28%). The transportation of metals by rail is estimated at the rate of 35% which is tripled that thase goods transported by road.
To conclude, during the analyses it is found out that there are specific goods which are likely to be transported by either by rail or by road.
