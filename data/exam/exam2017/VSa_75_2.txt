In our days there is big problem in the world of sport. It's a illegal drugs which are eaten by many sportsmen. So some part of our society are sure that people who using drugs should be excluded from competiton for a big period. Others think that this sportsmen must be excluded from sport for the all live.
Personally I think that athelts, who take drugs mus be banned on a some perod. There are some causes for it.
Firstly, sport education very expinseve for goverment. It's million dollars and many time. So if you bann professional athletic in competition for all him life, you can destroy state
Secondly, people who ate drugs can say that it was the biggest error in their life and they wont take drugs. So if sportsmen whant begin their life without drugs we can help them. So one of type of help to this people is a chance to take part in competitions.
On the other hand we can see that excluding from competition for all live is necesarry because sometimes goverment help to athletes take drugs. Also govermen help athletes to crush tests which must show drugs in blood of sportsmen. For example we can say about problems with our sportsmen in last year when all world know about drugs in Russian sport. Also, some athletic eat drugs after punishment and they whant stop do it. So in this case excluding from competitions on little period cant solve this proplem.
in conclusion I would say that excluding from competitions on different periods the better than bann on all life because this can qive secon chance for people who live only with sport.
