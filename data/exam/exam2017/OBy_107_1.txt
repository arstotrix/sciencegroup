Here we can see the chart, that shows changes in the unemployment rate in selected world regions in 2014 and 2015. So, talking about N.Africa, we should say, that the percent of unemployment rate in 2014 and 2015 didn’t change and was the same – 12,5. In Middle East in 2014 the percent of unemployment rate was on several percent higher, than in 2015. Talking about EU, we should say, that the number has rised from 7,5 to 7,9 percent during the period from 2014 till 2015. In Latin America the number of unemployment rate has fell from 6,8 to 5,8 during the period from 2014 till 2015. 

In South Asia the number didn’t change on this period. The same situation in World wide – the percent was the same, but a bit higher then in South Asia – 5,9.

So, summarising this information, we can say, that the highest percent of unemployments in both years is in N.Africa and the lowest percent of unemployments is in South Asia.
