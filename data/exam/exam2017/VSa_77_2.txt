Nowadays the case of using illegal drugs in professional sport has become a burning issue and make a lot of concernes. Thus, there are widespread debates on measures against those competitors who were caught on it. Some people believe that such sportsmen should be penalized for some time, for instance, for two years, whereas others assert the necessity to ban the violaters from competing professionaly forever.
To begin with, it s wortwhile to remember that professional sport is a specific lifestyle. Therefore, the decision to bond the life with it implies the responsibility, one might make an inner agreament with the rules of this society. This provoke the idea that the athletes caught, should be banned from participating in the competitons for the rest of their lives. Virtually, this opinion is based on the term of "professional honesty" that is extremly significant in any professional area.
Otherwise, as the famous quote says "I am a man and nothing human is foreign to me". All people make mistakes and one false step might be punished but should not occur to be the fatal in someone's life. Even gads provide the opportunities to alter the views and undertake a novel attempt. Such a stance breed the idea of a part-time ban.
To summarize, the use of illegal drugs in sport is a pertinent issue to discuss as the professional sport requires the respect to others and the responsibilities for decisions, but at the same time everybody is reckoned to have a right on mistake. As far as I am concerned, those punishments should be only for some time as sometimes people do not realize that they are doing on the way to their dream. To conclude, it is necessary to tackle the problem, but it would be better to do it among the people connected with this kind of activities.
