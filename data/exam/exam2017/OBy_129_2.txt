Nowadays, there is one interesting opinion about producing a food. Ones said that every country should take care about getting food inside country as much as they can. In my opinion is that the goverment should firstly think about economical reasons of producing food. 

To begin with, there are more than 200 countries in the world, so we can’t have an universal receipt of how and where get and produce the food. For example, russian territory is not good enough for planting some fruits, but population, who lives there, needs to eat them to get a needable resourses, so it is sensible to buy them from another countries. Secondly, food market is one of the largest so there is no economical profit of closing market to produce only for own population.

However, there is some disadvantages of having every borders opened to other countries. Firstly, importing food from abroad led to negative economical effects. The main importers of food do not have an aim of improving an agricultural complex at all. That’s why for such a long time Russia, country with a biggest size of fields didn’t planting as much as she can. So, more and more farmer’s families became very poor. In addition, when most of food, which population eats, is producing incide of country, less money is gong away from it. Protecting of national agriculture can be very profitable for a government because of getting more taxes from a population. 

However, country should be sensible in understand thein planting possibilities. Severe climate countries should buy food from other countries with warmer climate or investing in developing new ways of getting a food for their population, All depends about what is more profitable and good for people.
