It was very surprising to me that today young people tend to violate the law more often than several decades ago. Obviously, increasing scores of crimes are making usual life more dangerous for everybody and thus, this number of crimes should be decreased by society actions. But firstly we should answer questions how such a situation could be possible and whether the goverments are guilty for this.
In my opinion, one of the most important reason why children do so many crimes is the regulation of the child labour. Nowadays, it's quite hard for children to get some not very complicated job. In order to defend children from users of their labour, goverments have closed the majority of opportunities to work for children. On the other hand, there is an another potential reason. The law violation is often considered by something brave at teenagers’ society. Frankly speaking, it is very actual for ex-USSR countries
Therefore, there are several ways to decrease young people crime rates. These ways do not exclude each other. Firstly, parents should try to provide extra work for their children, then they will have extra money and no extra time for potential crimes. School institutions also should help children to find a part-time work. Secondly, somebody should provide respect to law in the teenagers’ minds. I think that teachers can not do very much to provide such a law respect, it is also kind of a part of parent obligations.
Actually, maybe there are more reasons of such a crime boom, but I think that reasons stated above are one of the most important. That is why some actions against these reasons, sort of easing of teenagers’ employment or teaching of law respect, can strongly affect the current situation.
