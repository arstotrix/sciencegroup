Nowadays, many people buy or download illegal discs, instead of buying the original discs in the shop. Some people belive that buying illegal discs should by punished.
In my opinion the goverment do not have to punish people who buy such products, but people who produce illegal pirate copies should be punished. Nowadays, the biggest part of people buy or download films of music in internet in such web-sites like amazon or ebay. Of course in the internet you can not understand is it an original disc or it is not. Moreover, sellers do not want to tell real information about their production especially about quality and manufacturer. Futhermore, that means that many buyers even do not know that they buy illegal products.
In other hand, there are people who get huge amount of money every month from producing illegal copies of famous musical groups. Such people make illegal version of original discs and sell it in internet or in some small shops. They get a huge amount of money doing this illegal work and in my opinion they should be punished.
In conclusion, musical and film producers lose their money from illegal pirate copies. People who by such illegal products sometimes even do not know that it is not original, and they pay money and get a bad product with an awfull quantity. So in addition people who produce pirate copies should be punished.
