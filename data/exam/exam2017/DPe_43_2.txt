It is well-known that the entertiment industry gets enormous damage from illegal copying of their products every year. Now everybody can esealy sitting at home in front of a laptop and watch any movie he wants and will not pay even 1 cent. And a lot of people believe that such illegal activity should be punished as other crimes. As for me, I absolutely agree with this position because of some reasons.
First of all, thefts of such type in first order suffer people who are responsible for all these movies and music that people enjoy every minute. They make their own work as all other people including politics and policy and therefore they have to get their salary. If something is theft it is always crime. So why rules for thefts of this type should be another? Moreover, copying and sharing programmes, music and films is prohibited by the law. It is obvious that people who do this dirty work are need to be found and punished.
By the way, there is another point of view. Everybody loves watch films and listen to the music as it makes people happy in dayly routine and sometimes even give power to do another step. Nevertheless, not all of them can get it because of low income. So, copies in the Internet is the only way to touch this. Another people live in such special areas. Where modern foreign film industry, for example, is prohibited by the goverment as in some east countries.
To sum up, it is evident that such copying of information is illegal activity as people who produce all this music and films have great harm.
