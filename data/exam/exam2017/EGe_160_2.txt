Many people like to watch British or American films more than films produced in other locations. I think that these films are truly the best because of the following reasons.
To begin with, UK and USA are very rich and developed country and they can spend enough money to make a good and realistic film. Then they know what people need because they feel the mood of our society. There are a lot of fashion clothes there and girls from all the world may look like their favorite characters. Nevertheless, I am sure that the main reason is the fact that the most of countries are oriented on American culture and some people want to look like Americans or British.
Some people wants governments to give money to local industries to develop them. It is a difficult question if governments should give more money to such firms. On the one hand, the level of American and British films is rather high and it would be difficult to do something better or at least the same. However, on the other hand, it can be something new and may give new directions to the cinema. Although I think that the American and British cinema are the best, I am sure that local industries can show something significant and people will like these films.
To sum it up, some people reckon that American and British films are the best nowadays but it would be interesting if governments provide more financial support to local film industries.
