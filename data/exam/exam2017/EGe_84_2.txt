Nowadays the problem of adolescent crime is widely discussed as more and more young adults commit illegal acts. Although the government is trying to fight this in collaboration with parents, the number of legal violations has become alarming in the recent years. In this essay, I will outline the causes of this tendency and provide some possible solutions.
First of all, teenagers require a lot of care and attention. When they are being ignored by their family and friends, youngsters resort to crime in order to be noticed. A possible way to change this situation is introducing certain team-building activities for families to return trust among their members. For example, it is possible to start an organization that sets up retreats where families do activities that reqire support and understanding or have honest discussions where everyone listens to each other's viewpoint.
Secondly, a lot of adolescents are urged to make life-changing decions at a very young age, like choosing their future profession. This puts them under an incredible amount of stress, so they rebel against the norms of society and choose an alternative, albeit illegal, way of providing for themselves. In this situation parents and teachers should provide psychological help and assist teenagers in choosing their path. Lectures and talks with successful people from various professional fields, organized by the school staff, as well as parents encouraging children to explore their talents will make youngsters more ambitious and career-minded.
Taking everything into consideration, although teenagers sometimes stray from the appropriate lifestyle, which is accepted by the society, it is the responsibility of elder mentors to help the young to understand who they are and choose their future accordingly.
