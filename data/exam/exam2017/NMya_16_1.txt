Social networks have huge role in our life today. Nowadays, there are a lot of different types of social networks. Some networks are used for chatting with each others. In others, we make photos and videos of everyday life. At the end, in networks we communicate with colleagues and search jobs.
At this graph, we can see statistics about percentage of respondents of different ages who uses types of social networks which I mentioned before. If we talk about facebook, the youngest group has biggest percentage of people who use it. In others groups, popularity of facebook is lower. However, at least fifty percent of each groups uses it. Instagram, comparing to facebook is less popular, especially among elder groups. The reason, of such unpopularity, is quite simple. Elderies don’t like to show their everyday life to the whole world. Linkedin isn’t very popular among any group. However, there isn’t big difference between percentage of respondents, who uses it, if we compare to previsious social networks.
