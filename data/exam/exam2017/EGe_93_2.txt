Some countries in order to diminish some serious civil issues are considering the program which aim is to provide citizens a minimal amount of money. Will this policy make more good than bad? This is what I’m going to speculate about in this essay.
It’s undeniable fact that the world has been undergoing huge economic downturns, that’s why nowadays it’s extremely difficult to find a job even for people with high education. The number of the unemployed has escalated drastically and it’s projected to rise. So in this case it’s quite a reasonable idea to provide people with even minimal extent of money so they can overcome these times and survive. Correspondingly, such policy may prevent death fatalities such as suicides, for example, since it’s a well-known fact that most of the times people tend to commit suicide when encountering financial problems.
Despite the fact that such program seems to be quite beneficial, it has some downsides too. First of all, the number of unemployed people will grow dramatically since there won’t be any reason for them to find a job. For example, such governmental programs exist in some countries in Europe. Almost the most part of the population is homeless people, who live for money given by government, so that there are even vast swaths of the cities of poor people. Last but not the least, even though such program will be created, it doesn’t guarantee the stability and prosperity of the country and the gap between the poor and the wealthy will still be the problem of high importance.
Concluding. Although this program seems to be beneficial it will not eradicate all the problems
