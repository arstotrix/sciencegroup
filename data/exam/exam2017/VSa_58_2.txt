Nowadays, cheating in sport becomes very common, especially on the Olympic games. People try to discourage them by banning sportsmen from competiting for 2 years. But there are those, who argue that such athletes should be banned forever and never be welcome in sport. I think, that the second point of view is more appropriate, as it garatees other sportsmen that there will be no cheating. Anyway, in this essay will discuss both points of view.
Some people clam that sport nowadays becomes very popular and almost everyone has its favourite type of competing. For instance, there are lots of fans of football or tennis. Those, who watches competition or match, takes it like a show. They used to the main "characters" and sportsmen become familiar. Usually, people trust them, but in many cases they are not even interested whether their favourite athlete use drugs or not. It is a crucial issue, because people really do not focus on it and are not going to overcome it. Such people claim that athletes should not be banned at all or should be banned for a limited period. I am strongly disagree with these point of view, because there is no garantee in this situation that athletes will not be cheating in future.
There are those, who understand the importance of this problem. People claim that sportmen should be banned for the rest of their lives. In this case using illegal drugs will not be flourish and sport will be safe. Sportmen and other people will be sure that it is a fair game. I consider that this is the main feature of sport and fair game should not underestimated. Obviously, athletes who use llegal drugs should be banned forever.
To conclude, there are different points of view, but people should understand that cheating in sport must be banned.
