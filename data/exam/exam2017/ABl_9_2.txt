The industry of entertainment has a lot of problems with people who use illegal ways to copy films or songs. There is a popular opinion that such pirate activities should be prohibited and a strict punishment for this crime should be created.
Modern technologies are really developed. With the help of them people can do everything on the internet and such progress cause a huge problems for a films or songs creators. First of all, musicians and producers do not get their money and have a lot of costs. If creators lose money, they would not have an opportunity to pay for actors and other people, who were involved in the process of film, clip or song making. Secondary, investors are not interested in activities, where they pay a huge amounts of money and other people just “steal” their production and money. Investors prefer to avoied such spheras where pirates can use special programmes and steal everything so easy.
Another significand reason why pirates are dangerous for industry of entertainment and producers or musitions is that actors or singers do not be inspired to take part in activities after that they will not get respect, glorial. Pirates usually copy film or songs in a bad quality. because of this other can not estimate the work of singers or actors and tne do not want to work in this situation.
To sum up, pirates are really dangerouse to film producers and song creators. And their activits should be punished.
