The diagram shows us the development of the book market in four countries, which are the USA, Germany, China and the UK from 2014 to 2018.
If we look at the amount of sold printed books and eBooks by the year of 2014, we can see that most of them were bought in the USA, because the figure of money for printed books is 10,5 billions US dollars and the figure of money for eBooks is 5,5 billons US dollars. If we turn to the forecast of sellings of print and eBook market by the year of 2018, the leader will be USA, too. The figure of money, which will be reached by selling printed and eBooks in this country, is around 16 billions US dollars. This fact can be caused by the reason that people in the US will buy nearly equal amount of printed books and eBooks.
