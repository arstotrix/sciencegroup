Some people argue that spending money on investigation of space is a waste. And it could be better to spend them on solving society problems.
In my opinion, there could be some arguments for both points of view. Of course, space exploration is the crutial thing in terms of the development of humanity. Today we are facing some problems, which could make out living on the Earth impossible: for example, overpopulation, climat changeing, problems with drinking water. The serch of the other planets, wich are suitable for human beings is one of the most important problems for space exploration. So, I suppuse, that people who think that investigation of space is less important than urgent problems, do not think about it in the perspective way.

But I could also agree with people who argue that we should pay more attention on today's problems, such as enviromental problems and on-going wars in the Arabic region. Environmental issues are the reasons why space investigation is so important. The faster we start to care more abot the ways of useing energy and water, the more time we have to live on the our birth planet.
I aslo think, that poverty is one of the main reasons of society and environmental problems. People, who do not have enought money for everyday needs will never think about the economy of natural resouces. That is why we should figure out some ways to increase the average level of live.
All in all, space exploration is not less important than urgent problems in society, but we should allways look for the balance and not forget about the Earth's problems.
