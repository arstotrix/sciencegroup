Nowadays we live in an age of high technologies. we use a lot of them, especially the internet. It is a huge problem, when people copy films or music and share it in the internet. Such situation is very costly for the film studios and musicians. Some people consider that people, who download films and music for free from the internet, instead of buying original discs in a shop, should be punished. There are some arguments against this point of view.
Firstly, the illegal pirate copies of films and music appear in the internet after the premier of the film in cinemas. In some situations, the pirate copies appeared in the internet 2 weeks after the film started in cinemas. In 2 weeks the producers of this film usually can gain a lot of money from cinemas and usually the amount of money is more that a budget of the film. Moreover, the quality f pirate copies is often bad, with awful sound and dark picture. That’s why a lot of people prefer to buy licensed discs. In this logic, police shouldn’t arrest people, who share files.
Then, it can be easily seen, that the governments of the different countries all over the world try to ban web-sites in the internet, where people can download pirate copies of films. But this policy of blocking web-sites doesn’t work, because there are a lot of hackers, who can hack the system and continue to share illegal files. If police catch one hacker, there will be another one. This is a “circle”, and there is no way to break it.
In conclusion there should be said, that people will always share illegal films and music. In this way, the musicians and film producers should make qualitative content. If they make good films, people will visit cinemas instead of downloading films from the internet.
