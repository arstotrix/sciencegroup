The pie charts represents the information about world-market between European countries and kinds of transporting goods. Overall, rail transportation is more appropriate for metals whereas food products are commonly transported by road.

The percentage of chemicals' transportation is approximately the same - 11 per cent of all goods transported by rail and 16 per cent by road respectively. There is a key difference between pie charts and methods of transportations: one third of all transportations by rail is metals and it appropriates to 35%. In contrast, one decimal of all goods transported by road are metals. There is a six fold difference between percentage of machinery transportation - 12% and 2% transported by rail and by road in comparison.
