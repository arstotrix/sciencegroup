Modern technology become more popular in our days. There are many advantages of this proces. But the number of disadvanteges is the same. Many people think that one of them is an increasing number of illness. I agree with them.

First of all, people send a lot of time in front of television, computer and other modern technics.  This lifestyle follow to different awful problems with body and eyes, even blindness. Despite this fact people continue to spend their time in such way, they watch TV or play in computer like crazy. So people become lazier and then fat. Extra weight – another important problem in our life. Fat people die earlier than thin.

Another big problem is pollution. The number of caus increase every day. Atmosphere become more and more pollute. This fact of course influence on our health.

There are many ways to solve this problems. Firstly, people shouldn’t spend so much time with modern gadgets. It’s become a part of our life, but it’s don’t mean that people should use gadgets all the time like zombi. Also people must relay some rules when using modern technics. For example, don’t seat too close to computers or TV. Secondly, people should built special buildings wich will help to clean atmosphere.
