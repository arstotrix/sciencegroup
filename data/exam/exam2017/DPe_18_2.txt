No one can raise an objection the fact that the entertainment industry plays important role in our life. Some peolple believe that people, who illegally copy the private products and download to the Internet, are criminals. I definitely agree with this statement and I will prove it in this essay.
Firstly, not only producers of films and music lose their money. Government also suffer from illegal copies, because of people have a free access for ententainment, huge companies will go away from nationcl market. As the result, the government will have lack of taxes. For example, many Americans firms don’t enter to Russian market, because russian authorities don’t deal with illegal products
Secondly, this situation strictly influences social habits and behaviour. If people have a chance to watch films and listen music at home, they will stop going to cinemas and conserts. Therefore, social communication will reduce seriously. 
However, others think that illegal pirate copies is good opportinity to educate and develop as the other parts of society. In my opinion, this opinion is incorrect and it causes the real problems between different social groups. Moreover, there are special state programmes and web sites, which government creates for sharing materials for poor people.
In conclusion, as some individuals continue sharing music and films, it badly effect on musicians and producers, goverments and whole society. Goverment loses additional profit from faxes, consumers doesn’t have incentive to spent money on entertainment. Political and economic leaders should change the situation in the nearest future.
