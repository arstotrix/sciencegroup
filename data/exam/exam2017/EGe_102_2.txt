As we all know, our world is not saved, we can face many bad things and ,what is worse, bad attitude among the people, so that it all makes crime, which will never be vanished. Nowadays it is believed, that crime is done by young generation, not by elder people.
Firstly, I would like to mention that today rather big amount of young people do not study as well, they have no motivation to study, to learn something new and by this way the are not able to find yourself. As a result, it becomes necessity to get more by the easiest way. For instance, they can do burgling, pickpocketing and other bad things.
It is needed to be controlled in proper way. For example, some parents ARE the source of this problem. What is the worst that they do not grow their children up in proper way, they can not control them. Children always need some attention, even the smallest. They need it so much that they can behave like this to get some attention from their parents a bit .Moreover, the teachers should motivate the youth, make children to hear them, because teachers are mentors! I strongly believe, that attitude and relationships between teachers and pupils should be changed, particularly in Russia. Teachers in Russia are accept as a minor, that is why pupils are afraid of them and even can not talk about something after school time. Furthermore, the youth behave this way because of lack of some interests. It means, that they should find something that will give them positive feelings, something that can unburden the interest. I do believe, that sport can solve this problem, because when you do this you are focused only on this deal and can relax and get rid of bad things from your mind.
To sum up, I would like to add, that actually all these bad things depend on a person. Some people have strong spirit, the feeling of honesty and they fight with it well.
