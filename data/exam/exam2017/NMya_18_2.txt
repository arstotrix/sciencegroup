It is stated that nowadays more crimes are being committed by young people than ever before.
In my opinion, the main cause of this problem is the lack of parents' and teachersâ€™ control and the lack of engagement of young people. Nowadays parents often work most of the time, having almost no time to their children left. Therefore, children have a lack of engagement. They do not have enough attention from their parents, so they need to engage themselves on their own.
At the same time, educational system in most of the countries is built the way that the majority of kids and teenagers are bored, so they hate school and, therefore, are not engaged with education.
As a result, young people are left uncontrolled and unengaged. At that very moment, the role of other kids and teenagers around them is extremely important. And often badly raised kids have more authority in such cases. That is why a lot of young people are influenced by those trouble kids, so they also start behaiving badly and become juveniles.
From this perspective, parents and teachers can change the situation. First of all, parents should spend more time with their kids and engage them more. Secondly, teachers should do their best to make young people being interested in their subjects. In addition to that, a special approach towards troubled kids is required. If parents are not able to engage their children themselves, they should at least try to pick a good surrounding for them. If a child is surrounded by motivated pupils, he or she will also try to be better and study harder under their influence.
