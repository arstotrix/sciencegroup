There has been a dispute on the topic, if humanity should spend money on social problems instead of exploring the space. Some people believe that environmental issues and poverty are more important, but is it really so?
Well, I personally believe that the space expeditions and researches are not standing in the way of solving everyday problems of the society.
It is common knowledge that governments of such states that have space programs often do a lot of expences on building spacecrafts and supporting space researching scientists. But these countries usually have a budget that can offord both space industry and spending money on helping to solve such problems like the environmental polutions or coalas extinction.
Moreover, the important thing is that not only states' governments do space explorations. There are individual companies that are specialised on evolving what people know about the outer space. One of these companies is SpaceX developed by Elon Mask. This company have done dosens of experiments on landing a space rocket and has plans to make Mars a place where people can live. This fact proves that people can do the science without the help of the state, which saves governments money to deal with other urgent problems.
All in all, most people believe that it is useful to learn about how universe works or just explore new worlds, but all of these things can give humanity a chance to find other races or resources that can not be found on Earth. The science is the engine that makes people develop and this engine should never be stopped.
