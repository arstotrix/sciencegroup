So, intellectual property and rights on it are a question of highest concern to many governments, that have to face the modern reality and update its legislation. I think, that severe punishment for such minor offence is irrelevant.
Firstly, the price of seeking these deliquents would exceed the amount of reasonable fee for this crime. I think, that every government has more important things to spend money on. Secondly, the harm from pirates is not so high – if it was, Misicians, film producers and others would simply stop producing, as their lousses would exceed their incomes. I do not see this happening. Then, it is not pirates and other consumers who have to adjust. Supplier must make his product attractive and easy to use, instead of trying to fight on the battlefield with nobody but them left – let’s face the reality, no one used discs today. I do not have nor computer with disc driver, neigher TV. So how am I supposed to use these discs? Producers must meet me halfway on the internet, creating convenient and useful on-line resources with their production, and I will buy subscription with a great pleasure, as I am tired of spending hours in search for a video with a proper sound and quality to download from torrents before watching any film.
To sum up I would say that I do not think that sharing and copying intellectual properties on the Internet is a crime or any kind of offence, neigher I think it should be controlled by the governmental structures. As any relations concerning purchasing same product this case must be regulated by supply – demand law. I’m sure that seeing the problem in proper way will help consumers to get what they want, producers – to earn their money and goventment – to not waist time and resources on irrelevant things.
