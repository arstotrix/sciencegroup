Now a days a lot of people and the goverment are asked a quesnion:"On what thing we should spen money for the chearful: on space exploration or on the sold environmental and society problems". Actually, this is a really hard questins, because when we spend money on the one thing the another thing becone moer difficult.
Firstly, I believe, that the space could wait a time, when we will solve the more urgent problums on the our planet -- Earth. Because this dificutes with environmental issues we couls just lose owe planet and our civilisation and as the result nowbody be abel to risind in spase.
Secondly, if we meet with another forms of live, we shoul be prepeared for this meeting, because we do not know the norms of behavior for them and could open a new Great War whis kill humans on the Erth. The good eximple of the same sityation is the move be Fedor Bondarchuk, where people did not usdersten the politison of the alies and decided that they are agressiv and flue on the Erth for taking a the kollony of people.
On the over hand, problems in society such as poverty or environmental issues will be always. Our children will try to decide it, their children too. We can not keep of nature and planet for us and for our relatives, because we have many problems with the polite and more problems we born. This is the unfinished story about how we kill our Erth. And because of this, spending money on space exploration is not a waste of money.
In conclusion, the goverment and we should think about future and about our children and deceide, which problems are moer actualle and more dengerous for all people.
