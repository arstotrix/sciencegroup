In our days there are a lot of people, who would like to download music and films on the internet for free, but very often it leads to loosing a lot of money by artists and producers. I suppose, that Inlernet pirats should be punished and I will give my arguements in the essay.
Firstly, it is known that people of art usually earn money by selling copies of their discs with films and songs. It is written on each copy, that people could not copy and share this product without special rights. In whole world this activity is illegal. In the era of the Ynternet it became very difficult to control the situation with authors right, that is why the punishment should become more strictly for this type of theft.
There is no way of developing in art industry, while internet pirates will share their pirate copies of songs and film, becouse authors and producers will have no money to create and record new cdâ€™s or to make new films. It is believed very often that songs and films are very expensive and coast much more than they should really coast, however there is no one person who try to get an expensive car for free just becouse it cost too much in his opinion.
To conclusion, any theft should be punished, becouse of many reasons. Copying and sharing products of art on the Inlernet is very easy, but it leads to degradation of industry. There will be no economical stimules to produce new films or to write songs if it will not be good authors law in the country.
