Two bar charts given illustrate the number of white and non-white people among ordinary people and prisoners in the UK and in the USA in the period of one year, 2015. It can be clearly seen from the chart that in the UK, the number of white people outweigh both in general population and in prison, by comparison to the USA, where in general population the number of white people was significantly higher, than non-white. According to the prisoners in the USA, there were 33 percents of white people, which is 34 percents smaller than the number of non-white people. In the UK the vast majority of prisoners were white people as well as among general population. There were only 12 percents of non-white people in general population in the UK, whereas the number of non-white people in the USA was considerably higher, 36 percents. Vast majority of those who were in gail in the USA was non-white people, by contrast to the UK, where there were only 26 percents of non-white prisoners.

Considering UK, there were more white people either in general population, or in prison, while in the USA there were more non-white people in prison, rather than in general population.
