The chart deals with the level of unemployment in selected regions in the world in 2014 and 2015, and the average world unemployment level. It can be clearly seen that there is a dramatic difference between some regions.
To begin with, it should be said that in Northern Africa and Southern Asia the number of unemployed people remained stable in 2014 and 2015 (12,5% for N. Africa and 3,9% for S. Asia for both years). At the same time three other regions consist of two groups: with rising unemployment level and decreasing level of unemployment. The first group has only European union whereas the second one contains Middle East and Latin America (in 2014 11% and 6,8% for Middle East and Latin America and in 2015 9,6% and 5,8% for both of them). As for the EU, the unemployment rate for this region had not changed too much: from 7,5% in 2014 to 7,9% in 2015.
To conclude, it should be noticed that although in different parts of the world the unemployment rate had been changing with different speed, the average unemployment level didnâ€™t change.
