Nowadays you can read about crimes commited by young people in the news every day of the week. The problem is stated more serious than ever. What are the causes of this situation? How can parents and teachers help to solve this problem?
Nowadays people often do not spend enough time teaching moral to their children. The reason why young people start commiting crimes is the absence of understanding the consecuenses of their behavior. Children should be taught not only about punishments for criminals, but also about impact of crime on ordinary people.
On the one hand, parents should teach their children that if everybody would be kind to each other, there would be no crime and nobody would suffer from thefts, nobody will be killed or hurt. But if anybody starts to break the law, stimuls for other people to do the same things appear. The net effect leads to development of illegal business. That means that every criminal not only harms people with illegal actions but also stimulates the crime.
However the learning moral aspect is not enough. Young people should be taught at school which actions are legal and which are not and which kings of punishments follow different crimes. This side of education helps to exclude the situations when people commit crime without understandind the fact that they are breaking the law.
All things considered, the problem of crime development should be solved through education, which consists from two equally important parts: moral aspect and learning the law. First thing should be teached by the family, while second one can be teached by school teachers.
