The graphs shows goods transported by rail and road. The percent of transported stuff always different exept the manufactured goods. It is 25 per cent by rail and 28% by road so number of transportation almost does not change. 

The girst chart shows that the most large transportation by rail is metals. It is equal 35 per cents from all transportation, while it takes only 11 per cents on the second graph. The smallest part on the girst graph takes non-metallic minerals â€“ just 6 per cents. Second graph informed us that the biggest transportation by road is machinery. Also machinery transportation by road the smallest from both of graphs. 

In conclusion I can notise that transportation through the rail and the road has almost the same values.
