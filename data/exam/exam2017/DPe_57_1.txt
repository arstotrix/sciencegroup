On this graphs we can see the rates of unemployment in different world regions in 2014 and 2015. On the last graph we can see that unemployment all over the world have not changed since 2014. The same shows us graphic in North Africa and South Asia, the numbers stayed on the same level for 1 year. But in midle East situation is much better the rate of umemployment felt from 11 to 9,6 which says us about good government politic. Same shows 4th graph, unempoyment get down very fast from 6,8 to 5,8 (which is more than 10% for 1 year) in Latin America. In European Union situation much worther, the rate of unemployment have not felt, moreover it has rise around 0,4 points. In the end, I would like to say that only Eupopian Union have huge problems with risen unemployment when middle East with Latin America are on the right way to overcome this problem.
