There are two charts which show us an information about how many millions of people used social site Facebook and why did they do it.

According to the first diagram, we can mention that there is a considerable difference in counting users with destops and users with mobile phones or tablets. We can also see that the amount of Facebook users increase, because there were overall 200 users per March 2012 and about 220 users in March 2013 .

The second diagram shows us why do people use Facebook and for what. The most popular answer as for women as for men is "sharing photos/videos". There is the same percantage for "receiveng updates": 39% women and 39% men had answered like that. Seeing funny posts is not very common for men, but for women it is. The low percantage answer for both sides was "learning about ways to help others". There is only 25% for men and 35% for women.

In conclusion, I'd like to say that we should less use social sites and do these things in a real life, not in a virtual.
