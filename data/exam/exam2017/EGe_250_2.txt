Nowadays more often the problem of air pollution is discussed on the defferent levels of goverment. The main question is how goverment can influence on this procces to reduce the harm produced by people`s actions.Whether goverement should introduce laws to reduce unnecessary air flights for busines and leisure is an issue worth discussing.
Some people think that using of own flights has some advantages. To begin with, for modern business and technology process it necessary for some people some different contries in one day, and air travel is just one way in such cases. In addition, the question of safety is important for businees-men and people from goverment because such people more often tha others can be goals for crimes. Moreover, the using of such way tavelling can make the function of airports lighter because it can reduce time spending for providing VIP clients.
In contrast, some people aim that the harm broght bt using private floghts more that these advantages. Fristly, te bigger number of flights in the sky can create more dangerous situation because in such case the navigation becomes more complicated. Secondly, in modern world the nerwork of airlines is so well created that number of flights is enough to move from one place to another in time comfortable almost for everyone.
Overall, it can be stated the number of private is better to reduce by goverement if the people want to resolve problem of air pollution.Personally, I belive that such laws will be apprecited by everyone positively.
