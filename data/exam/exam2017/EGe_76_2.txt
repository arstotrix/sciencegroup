In our modern world more and more teenagers are being involved in different types of crimes. In this essay I would like to discuss the reasons and probable solutions of this problem.
The first cause of such behaviour can be vulnurability of young people. They can be influenced a lot easier than children who still see their parents as authorities or adults who are more responsible for their actions and are aware of how they can effect their future. The teenagers need to show that they are worth being respected by all means. This is why they are being used in commiting crimes. Another possible reason may be lust for money and luxurious life. If parents are not able to give their children money or if they are just poor, young people will try to seek for another opportunity to get them. Since they do not have higher education, the only way some children find is committing crime.
First plausible solution to the problen can be envolving teenagers in different kinds of voluntary work. In this case they will learn that it is much better to help other people than to harm them in any way. Another variant may be opening some vacancies for young people either during summer time or in their free time. Through this important experience they will understand how hard it is to earn money and will not have to ask their parents for cash. Moreover, as for working with the teenagers who have already committed crimes meetings with prisoners can be arranged, who will tell these young children how they really regret doing that. In conclusion, I would like to say that it is highly important to show young children the consiquencies of committing crimes, to make them realise that it is not an easy way of getting money.
