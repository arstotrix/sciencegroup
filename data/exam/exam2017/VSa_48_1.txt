The bar chart gives us information about development of print books and electronic books in USA, Germany, China and UK between 2014 and 2018. As the diagram suggest, there are very different situations in these four countries.
First of all, it can be seen that in USA producing of print books in 2014 rather were hire, than in 2018 (in 2014 it was 10,5 billion us dollars, but in 2018 it will be only 7,5 billion US dollars). In the contrast, in Germany producing of this books remains stable (6 billion US dollars in 2014 and 6 billion in 2018). Secondly, the bar chart illustrates how changed development of the book market in China and in the UK. It is clear that in China was not a lot of changes: producing of print books in 2014 was 4,8 billion US dollars and in 2018 - 4,2 billion US dollars. Producing of electronic books slowly rised. Similar situation is in UK.
