In these day and age we can observe such situation that small businesses dont have an equall acess to market as the large. In many developing countries a huge diversity of small local companies are being displased by the multinational brends. In my eassay I would like to found out whether it has some benefits or not.
On the one hand, we have a vivid disadvantage is that our products will be much more expensive when we will have only big companies. The situation on the market will be very awful because of the monopoly such as we will have only big companies with the same goods and companies that have to make some profit and it wont be successful without small companies.As the result, the owners of big companies will increase the prices of the goods and it will have a bad impact on costumers.
On the other hand, we will have products and goods with the good quality. Multinational brends are very strictly monitor the quality of their productions unlike small companies where it is possible to easily detect the presence of any flaws or defects in goods.
Another bright advantage for having only big companies is that the costumers will have the most diverse range of goods than in small companies.Usually, big multinational companies are located in multi-million territories that allows to offer the buyer a huge number of possible options for one product.It can be of different colors, shapes.
To sum up all my thoughts, I would like to sat that even though multinational companies have its drawbacks but the benefits far outweigh.So, it is much better to have large companies than small.
