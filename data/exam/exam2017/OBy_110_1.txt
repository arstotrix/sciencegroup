The graph on the picture shows us the statistic of working people in different parts of the world and all over it. 

The highest column on the left side is Africa and the smallest is South Asia. In the both regions the size of colums is the same that shows us that in 2014 and 2015 years the level of unemploymant is the same.

In the middle East and Latin America unworking became less from 2014 to 2015, while in the EU people losed their payment places. The different is 0,4% in pointed years. 

It shows that in North Africa the position of unemployment is the most, but unchangable. The regions like Middle East and Latin America have a progress, but it is not so big to cover the regress of other world places. So if we look at worldwide statistic we will see the same hight of colums in 2014 and 2015 years. That do not show any progress at all.
