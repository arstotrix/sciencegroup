I agree with that position. I think, that this strategy can help upgrade economical situation in some countries. But I have one disagreement. As for me, any country must produce the food for import and not in small values, cause it support to nation get more money. Let me talk about it.

Firstly, yeah, it’s very wonderful to produce products that their own population eats. This thing must split all of of countries. It isn’t interesting, when you can eat everything everywhere. All nations will be different. By the way, we can place some markets of cafes with international food, but reduce their own. And countries can reduce spending money on ‘unpopular’ food in current place.

In other way of thinking, countries must not produce the food only for their population. Everyone must produce products for import, cause it so comfortable and cool to get money from other nations, that are interesting in ‘kitchen’ of your homeside. But count of that food must be normal, not little, not huge. That move helps us upgrade economical situation in any country. It help to upgrade life level in some nations in Africa and in south America.

As clearly seen, this statement not so correct, as for me. And I think, that there is kind of interesting idea, but I’ll correct some ‘mistakes’ there. It is so interesting to split countries in that way, but we must know, that import – one huge part of any country and everyone must keep it on mide.
