It is time that we all use mobile phones and computers. Sometimes we can spend a day with this gajets, but it can produce problems with health. People who use phones or computers every day for a long time always have problems with their eyes. It can become with people, who watching TV all day too.

The other health problem is about pollution on the streets in big cities. Cars, buses produce lot of smog and it can involve problems with health too. Clear air is very important for our organism and its dispear can make lot of health problems. That why people who have problems with health go to villages or places where there are no pollution, where air is clear.

Good news is that we can reduce this problems. People who have problems with their eyes can spend less time with their phones, computers or TVs. It is possible, but it is not easy because technology becomes a big part of our lives and we can not stop to using this thingt, but we can increase time spending this gajets.
