Nowadays selling pirate music and film is a profitable business. Producing compact discs and digital video disks brings criminal dealer a lot of money.

Small wonder that a main issue of consumers the debate, is the offensive price set on compact discs. Instead of spending nearly twenty dollars per compact disc, consumers are finding it much ,ore reasonable to illegally download the songs they want. The risk is very minimal.

To my mind, selling pirate music and films is a kind of theft because people who sell them exercise one of the exclusive rights of the copyright holder without autorization. Legal producers of music and film suffer considerable losses. Buying pirate production consumers support the seller’s unauthotization actions. What is more, the quality of these disks usually leaves much to be desired. So if you don’t want to waste your money and to lose your good spirits, you’d better not buy bad production. On the other hand, disks of good quality are usually rather expensive and not everybody can afford to buy them. Besides, pirates sell the latest records and so we are able to watch new films or listen to new songs. That is why a lot of people continue buying pirate music and film.

To conclude, I think it is better to go to the movies or to buy qualitative music and film if you want to enjoy good films or music. To add to it, bad music and film will disappear and it will improve the country’s economy.
