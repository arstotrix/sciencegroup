Nowadays everyone can choose what to watch from the great variety of films all over the world. However there is no secret that films produced in Great Britan and USA are more popular than local ones. Of course in some cases it depends on the persons taste, but there are many people who do not want to watch films made in their own contries or cities.
On the one hand it seems to be quite bad and even unfair that local films are not so popular than British and American ones. May be there is a problem in advertising, may be we should start watching local films just for their improving. But on the other hand everything has its reasons. If people prefer British and American films, they must be better than the ones produced in the local industries. Goverments of our cities do not spent so much money on producing films. As a result there are less special effects, less decorations and other thing than in American and British films. But the most important thing is people who make these films, who write and think about story line, who produse all the action and who act. If local goverments want to make film industries better and more popular, they should pay attention to people, who work there, to their education and, of coure, on their salaries. What about other ways to help local industries, we must not forget about advertising, which is important for popularity of films, but it can not help if films and the process of their producing needs improvement.
All in all, the main reason of popularity British and American film is their high quality. Local governments should support film industries in a way to make their films better and as a result more popular.
