The given bar chart provides the information on shares of grown-up users divided into age groups in the USA of the three social networks.

Overall, the proportions are similar for each social network as it can can be seen from the chart: the young accounts for the biggest part in all social networks, except LinkedIn where their number equals with edging people.
According to the graph, Facebook is the most popular mean of online communication in the USA among adults. It is mainly used by young people of the age 18-29 - their share is 87%, the second place is occupied by people of middle age (from 30 to 49) with 73%. The last two positions are taken by grown-ups of the age from 50 to 64 with a share of 63%, and edging people (from 65 years) with 56%. It is seen that the gap in numbers between all age groups is not very big - no more than 15%, whereas in the next social network - Instagram - the difference in percentages is singificant. The youth share accounts for 53%, while the second place belongs to 30-49 years old adults with only 25%. The numbers of other two age groups vary from 6% to 11%. Nevertheless, the information on the LinkedIn users shows that numbers of adults of various age evening out: the biggest share is now occupied by people of middle age with 31% and the next age group numbers are insignificantly smaller - users who are 50-64 years old account for 30%. In contrast to the Facebook data, where young users have the dominant share, in LikedIn their numbers are the same that edging people have - 22%.
