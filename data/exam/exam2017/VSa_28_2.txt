Some people believe that the huge popularity of modern technology is the reason of increasing amount of health problems. In my opinion, I agree with this statement. High modern technologies lead to illnesses and health troubles, which sometimes are quite hard to solve.
One of the greatest problems of health, connected with modern lifestyle, is bad eye-seeing. Nowadays a lot of people use gadgets, read from them all the time. That is the reason, why so many children and adults have to use glasses to see. Another health problem, caused by modern technologies, is weak spine. Today people work a lot and at work they have to sit all the day long near the computer at the office. So, sitting work leads to weak back musclues.
All of theese problems can be redused in some ways. First of all, parents should not allow their children to use gadgets very often, time for computer games and texting ought to be limited. Moreover, adult people need to do some sports, at least some excercises. It will strenghen their bodies and health in general Finally, the government can launch the social advertisement and create some program about importance of healthcare and reducing of using of technologies. Sport and healthcare have to become fashionable and popular among all the population.
To sum up, today people have a lot of health troubles connected with their lifestyle, So, that is very important to reduce theese troubles and create an environment, where people can use technologies less and care about their health more.
