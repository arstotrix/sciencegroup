The graph illustrates numbers of USA adults of different age categories, using three social networks, namely Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn.
Overall we can see that Facebook has significantly bigger popularity among adults than Instagram and Linked In. The percentage of users of different age categories does not differ much. While Instagram is mainly used by young adults and only half of that number is the percentage of users in the age between 30-49. As we can see from the graph the amount of people older 50 almost do not use this network. LinkedIn is the least popular of the three websites as the percentage of users of all ages is less than 35. But also it can be clearly seen from the graph that LinkedIn is not used by young people as much as it is used by adults older than 30.The percentage of middle-aged users of LinkedIn is approximately 30 percent, while only 22 percent of young adults are registered on that website.
In general, we can notice that young adults tend to have higher internet activity in social networks than people older 30.
