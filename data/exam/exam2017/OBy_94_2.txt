In this essay I will show why my opinion is that. Films and music should be free, to all people.

I believe that every labor must be paid for people have to pay for watching movies and listening music. Music and films intellectual property and must be paid for. It is necessary to arrest people who do not pay for it, but it is worth to impose a line on there. But many people can not afford going to the movies and concerts so they download everything from the internet. In my opinions if film should not be free, that global corporation lost a lot of many, becaus people will lose respect. Because, exempl orphans can non afford to pay to fims and music concerts, like many others.

So same if the music and films is paid, the musicians and actors will lose fame, because people will stop listening and watching them moves. After all they can not pay for these services. Becaus force people to walk violently and pay violently, no one has the right. Therefore  I think, what all, and music, and movies should be free fo all people. Students in creative universities have to watch a lot of films and listen to a lot of music. If they had to pay for all this, they would not have been able to study, becays most students have not job, and have not money. 

In this essay I have showed why I think that musicians and film producers should be free, and becaus if this will not so then companies that deal musicians and film producers lose money.
