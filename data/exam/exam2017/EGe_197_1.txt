The bar chart below shows how much time was spent on sport and exercise by men and women in dependence on their age in England in 2012
Looking at the graph, it can be seen that yonger people do sport much more than elderly ones which is quite obvious thing. The quantity of sportish English people decreases constantly from the 16-24-years-old interwiewers in age 16-24 to people over 75 years. So the yongest part of the male interwiewers spent 282,1 minutes on exercise and sport and the female part of them spent 114,1 minutes, whereas the oldest men could do it just for 29,2 mintues and oldest women just for 1o minutes.

Moreover, the bar chart demonstrates that in spite of the age male sport was in 2012 more popular than female one. However, the difference between figures showing the quantity of the young male sportsmen and the old ones is considerably less than the difference between a peak and a low of women's sport activities. What is interesting, in age of 55-64 years women did sport slightly more than men (the figures are 52,7 minutes for men and 55,4 for women).

Overall, almost in any age English men in 2012 were more active in sport, but this difference goes down with a course of time.
