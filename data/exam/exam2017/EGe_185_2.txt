There has been much debate about whether the government should spend the budget on common problems in society rather than on research in space. The essay examines both sides of this exiting issue.

On the one hand, there is a common belief that expenditure on science is a waste of time and money and the govenmental budget should allocated more prudently for folloing ressons. Firstly, lives of many sitizents is likely to be threatened when the poverty rate in a country is quite high and this condition should be the driven force behind the governmental expenditure. If government does not pay attention on this instead of scientific research, the hunanity will experience the great calamity. Secondly, disater will appear if the government skips the enviromental problem. It can be resulted in a lot of deseases , a big amount of victims among the animals and lack of meal for people as a outcome.

But on the other hand, many peole, including me, opine that without science, especially without space exploration the life will lose its meanings. Only by dint of scientific research the humanity has the world we live in, and the scence of existing in expolarion new areas, in knoledge that can be dispenced in the right way to open new horizon.
If goverment spent money only on public needs , the life would be less intresting , people would be less prominent. Space pursuit provide people with willing to research, with aim to make something new for the future, to make life better down the road
All things considered, I hold onto the view that in space exploration there more gains than pains, but i cannot help but agree that evry country should take into accont the sociaty needs
