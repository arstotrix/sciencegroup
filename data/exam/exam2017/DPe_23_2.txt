Nowadays lots of people keen on watching films and listening to music via internet rather than going to the cinemas or buying discs. In the result producers and musicians do not get the whole profit. That is why governments support them and the police catch “pirates” and “downloaders”.
In my opinion these laws are essential to support people rights and work. Firstly, pirates sell copies and get part of creators’ profit. It means that they steal someone’s work which can be considered as theft. Secondly, pirates and downloaders do not respect others’ work. Finally, people usually offer bad quality copies which can badly impress audience and they will not get true emotions and feelings.
Some people may argue that it is more convinient to watch films or listen songs and melodies at home using their own devices. Also it is a great opportunity to download files on gadgets and to have an access to it at any time.
These people forget that there is also a possibility to buy legal discs which they can play at home or buy a special right to watch or listen whatever they want on websites. Then they will have high quality product and will respect producers and musicians. Also they can spend their free time with someone going to concerts or to the cinema and then get more excited.
To conclude, copying and downloading pirate copies have to be considered as breaking law. We all should respect and support producers’ and musicians’ rights and work.
