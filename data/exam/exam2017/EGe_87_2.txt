To start with, we live in the deloping world and the unstopable technological progress.We are always run of time,because we need to make money. Some people deside to start up their own business but others prefer to work for large corpoeates due to the fact that small local businesses are being replaced with large ones. Now let us look on the benefits and drawbaks of this development.
From my view the main advantage is that large corporations may provide more working placed for the employee. I mean that we have a countless number of different factories as well as fars were the employee is always in need.Thats to this we will be able to shorten the unemployment rate.
But on the contrary there is a stuck of cons on that isue. Firstly a lot of people who have their own firms or work for themselfs will face with unemployment.They will be running of money and their families will suffer from it.
Secondly, a lot of national products, some natural products, toxic free products wich farmers used to perchase will be replaced with univeral ones which may have less good quality.
To conclude, i would like to say that there are more disadvantages than advantages according to those listed facts.
