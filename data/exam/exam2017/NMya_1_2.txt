Unfortunately, there is a strong tendency to an increase in the number of crimes commited by youngsters in the modern society. The thing is that young people in the developing world have much more freedom than earlier.
In addition to this, the world has become much more violent than it used to be. Firstly, teenagers and young adults today are opressed by mass media, especially the Internet. Social networks have become an important part of everyoneâ€™s everyday life, thus it is easy to manipulate people. As long as youngsters do not have enough experience, it is easier to influence their behaviour and benefit their naiveness.
Secondly, there is a trend to a rise in amount of violence presented in videogames and films, TV programmes and news. As a consequence, youngsters take violence in everyday life as granted and do not consider committing a crime to be a great problem.
Moreover, drugs have become one of the greatest problems we face today. Young people easily become a victim of illegal business, thus becoming a puppet in the hands of real criminals.
Nevertheless, teachers and parents can help their children cope with these problems by educating them from the very early age. I believe the stories about their own experience will actually help to imagine what can crimes result in. What is more, it is important that youngsters knew how are criminals punished.
To sum up, young people today need to get much more attention from adults. It is of utmost importance to shape a strong consciousness as early as it is possible in order to prevent the growth in number of young criminals and further achieve a visible decline.
