Nowadays, with the rapidly growing population of our planet, the question of where one can find a place to lead a prosperous live is becoming more and more relevant. One of the most agreed-upon possible solutions to this problem comes from space travel and space colonization. However, as always, there is a huge debate on whether this problem is urgent enough or should our government instead spent its money on more pressing isssues, like poverty and world pollution.
As for me, I firmly believe that space exploration is deeply benefitial to our society and should not be swept under the carpet in favor of working on other problems of modern society. The first argument in favor of that, in my opinion, is that with space travel comes an age of technical advancement, which, in turn, causes some issues to become more managable. Secondly, with the colonization of other planets, the number of opportunities for making money should skyrocket. It is even possible that a lot of civilians, as opposed to scientists, will find new ways of doing some things or even make a major discovery, thus causing their names to be forever remembered. Moreover, space travel is a fairly recent dream, while such problems as poverty were already experiensed for as long as thousands of years into the past. With that in mind, why should we even pay so much attention to these problems, if they have long proved themselves to be unsolvable?
Overall, I can certainlly see why some people and even politicians consider space exploration a waste of time and money, however, all things considered, such view is extremely near-sighted and can cause a great number of problems in the long run.
