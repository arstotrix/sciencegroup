The bar-chart on a picture shows the data on the development of the book market in four different countries: USA, Germany, China, and UK. It covers the situation on the market in 2014 with a prediction for 2018. Let us look through the diagram.
First of all, we will pay attention to the book market in USA. In 2014, the market of printed books in United States stays on a level of 10,5 billion dollars, which is higher than in any other country. Same is for the electronic books. Although the market is almost two times lower than the one of printed books, it still equals 5,5 billion dollars, which is bigger than any other markets of electronic books on the graph. The forecast for 2018, however, makes it clear, that there will be some significant changes in market situation in 2018. The market of printed books is going to drop to 7,5 billion dollars, while the market of electronic books is going to increase dramatically to a level of 8,5 billion dollars. The situation in China and Germany looks rather similar - the market of printed books doesn't seem to change significantly - 6 billion dollars in Germany in 2014 and 2018, and 4,8 billion dollars and 4,2 billion dollars in 2014 and 2018 in China. while the market of electronic books will see a slight increase - from 1 billion dollars in 2014 to 1,5 billion dollars in 2018 in China. In the United Kingdom, however, we don't see very much of changes, only a shift in the market between printed and electronic books, where the second one will take the lead in the future.
Overall, in the diagram we can see two tendences - the decrease in the market of printed books and increase in the market of electronic books.
