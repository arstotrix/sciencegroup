The given graph contains information about time english men and women spend on sport in 2015.
From the first glance it's easy noticed that men do much more sport.
Each table that shows mens' time is higher, than womens'.
The biggest difference in numbers is in teenagers group of 16-24 years old young people.
Here the amount of time men spend doing exercise is bigger more than twice compared to the women: 282,1 minutes vs. 114,1.
The only group, where situation is opposit, is a group of 55-64 years old people, where women spend 2,7 minutes more.
Another obvious data in the chart is that sport time decreases as people become older.
Only two groups rumbled from this statistics.
Women in age gap from 25 to 44 show stable time on the level of 92,8 minutes.
Men in 65-74 ages made a small jump compared to 55-64 years opd men.
They spent 7,8 minutes more than the younger group.
To sum up, I let myself to conclude that people in England respect sport, because none of the group showed 0 minutes result.
The shortest time is 10 minutes for women over 75 years old, what is also goot time for old ladies.
