A lot of people from music and cinema industry lose money due to somebody sends pirate copies to the Internet. People prefer to download films or music compositions and do not want to bye original versions of files.

On the one hand, I can understand people, who downloads files. It happens because of pries are rising so fast and people have not so much money for it. That’s why in the beginning we find files in the Internet and only if we can not find something what we need, we will buy it. In various countries industries have got different opportunities to control illegal process of making pirate copies. For example, in Russia approximately all media files you can find in web. However, in Europe, as I know, it is hardly to do copies and, of course, to download them.

On the other hand, it is really bad when musicians and film makers lose their money. This is their work and it is understandable that they want collect money for their job. It is really difficult to work in this spheare. This job takes a lot of time, energy, emotions. Let’s think about this problem. For instance, one film producer spend a lot of money and power for making film, however, people download it and do not go to the cinemas, do not pay for original discs. That’s why producers haven’t more opportunities for making his films and due to pirates copies he lose his job. I suppose that solution of this problem is decreasing prices.

In conclusion I want to say that all this points of view can be right. Now our general aim is happening people from music and cinemagraphic speare.
