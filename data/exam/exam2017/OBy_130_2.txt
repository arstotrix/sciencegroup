On the Earth there are a lot of countries with radically different climate. Everybody knows that some plants need in special weather conditions. It means that countries often focus on products, which easier to make exchange with other regions and after it have variety of food. However, some people claim that it’s wrong way, they believe that country should import as little as possible. I absolutely disagree with this opinion. In my essay I’ll try to explain why I think so.

Firstly, it’s doubtless, that we can’t do everything perfectly, but when we need to do just a few things instead of great amount, it’s easier to achive good quality. So, I believe that it’s good idea to share what you can do and take what others can do. It can makes relationship between countries better. And there is a probability that if you don’t want to buy something, then you can’t sell own production. It is bad for economic of country. 

The second argument in favor of my point of view is people’s health. Humans need in different types of food to provide own well-being. But if countries don’t make an exchange, you haven’t some products with special consistence. For example, in countries where always cold temperature there are no any plants and it is bad for people, they don’t get a lot of necessary vitamins. 

In conclusion, I’d like to add, that people shouldn’t afraid of cooperation of countries, it is always good to have close and kind relationships. Moreover, it would be interesting for us to have such opportunity to try the best products which other countries can make.
