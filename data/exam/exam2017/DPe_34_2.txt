There are many different arguments for and against illegal sharing files. As for me, of cause, it is not totally right, but I think people should not be strictly punished for copying without lisence.
Firstly not all people have enough money to efford a Bly-ray DVD, subscription to Netflex but they still want to watch movies and listen to music they like. I think that musicians and TV-produers should give an option to the person to pay money or not, because this way they will be more generous to their fans. The famous Russian writer Dmitry Glukhovsky publish his books with millions of copies and he gives an opportunity to download it from the Internet for free In one of his interview he said he wanted to let everybody to read it and the appreciation of this work is worth much more than money. Actually people still would buy a paper book after reading. Electronic version if they really liked it and enjoyed reading. The same thing with music if the song really touchs your soul most people prefer to pay for a high-quality song. So the are no need to punish people who let us to try some movies and music and then decide of we want it to buy 
Secondly, some educational movies should be avaliable to watch them for free, because forcing people to pay for basic knowledge of world leads to the uneducated nations and global problems – so at least Discovery and National Geographic programs should not take fee.
It’s not a secret for everybody that companies lose lots of money because of illegal sharings of their files but I don’t think it’s a crucial question for them So copywriters should not be punished for their actions.
