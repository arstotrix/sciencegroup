Nowdays the society is convinced that using drugs by sportsmens should be panished. Some think that these athletes should be banned for a limited period. However, others believe they deserve to be banned for the rest of their lives. The essay will discuss both points of views.
I strongly believe that everyone can make a mistake, so the athletes who use illegal drugs should be panished for a limited period. After their banned period they should have a chance to take all medical tests. If they pass the tests they will have an opportunity to competite. Some people can argue, because the impact of the strongest drugs is not study well, therefore the athletes can change their health for the rest of the life. In that case, the government should state an addictional tests for these athletes, which will provide the information about all aspects of health, physical and mental conditions of sportsmes.
Moreover, it the professional athletes did not use illegal drugs, the sport would not be so interesting. The sportsmens overcome human limits only by using drugs.
On the other hand, when the athletes take steroids, they show a bad example for the young generation. Teenagers start thinking they will not achieve the goals in the professional sport without drugs. It leads them to not work hard, but use the drugs to become ordinary athletes. For these reasons sportsmens using the drugs should be banned for the rest of the life.
To conclude, the government should ban the athletes for only a limited period. However some sportsmens should be banned forever if they are popular and have a strong and deep influence on the young athletes.
