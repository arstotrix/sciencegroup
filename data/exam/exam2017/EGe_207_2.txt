Some people believe that the modern tendency for exploring space is useless and cannot help our society. There are more urgent problems that cannot be ignored such as poverty and environmental issues. I do not agree with this opinion.
First if all, our planet runs out of fossils and resources such as oil or water. We will need some other source of them very soon. Trees are cut everywhere for making goods for people so this process cannot be stopped. However, we know that trees are the source of oxygeon -- the thing we cannot breath without. That means we eventually make ourselves lose the most important thing in life. Therefore we need to explore the space: we look for a place where we can leave some day, but for now no human being do not even reach the Marce. People should spend much time and money on developing technologies to make it happen. Otherwise, some day we will have no place to go.
Secondly, problems with environment are too large to be solved. No one can force every man on the Earth use sun-charged cars instead of oil, for example. There are also a lot of trash everywhere and we even have no place to put it.
Furthemore, goverments and societies over the world do a lot of work for poor people: social programs that include giving money or jobs, free food in churches and special places for homeless people to sleep.
The main point is that it does not mean there are enough money for these problems. However, space exploring is too important sphere to be taken money from and people can work out other ways to solve them: to decrease sallaries of politicians, for example.
In conclusion I would like to say, poverty and environmental issues are important and large problems too, but they are not the only problems that should be solved. Space exploring will help us to survive so goverments should pay attention to it too.
