These charts show information about the transportation of goods by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008. Overall, it can be seen that the charts are quite different. To begin with, we can witness, that the percent of metals and food products is far higher at the second chart, while the percent of machinery is far higher at the first chart which illustrates goods transported by rail. Interestingly, that the parts which are called "manufactured goods" and "chemicals" have fairly similar percent on both charts. Comparing the chart which illustrate goods transported by road with the chart "goods transported by rail" we can witness a decrease of the percent of non-metallic minerals at the first chart (6% at the first chart and 13% at the second) To conclude, the most popular goods among those which transported by rail are metals and manufactured goods, while the most popular goods among those which transported by road are food products and also manufactured goods. These charts have some common features, though this trend may be changing
