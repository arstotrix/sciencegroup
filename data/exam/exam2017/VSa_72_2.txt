At the moment prohibited drugs are used in sport more often than it was earlier. There two views on punishment for this action. The radical one is to forbid athlets to anticipate competions whole their life. The calmer one is to prohibit them to participate for a certain period. Nowadays this problem is really burning and I would like to resolve such a dichotomy.
Adherents of the first opinion posit that the limited period of prohibitance could be an impact to self-development and just a good example for sportsmen. For instanse, the eminent german boxer Max Gr√§ber was banne for two years. Soon after the punishment he became a world champion. He told that thi prohibitation stimulated him to mundane training. He even supposed that if he had not been banned, he would not have won the Olympic Games. The allyes of this theory say that small periods to ban just stimulate to risk with drugs. The cost of fast is not so high.
Concerning the second idea it is difficult to underestimate its severity, but no one has any doubts in its efficiency. The most considerable example is the enermous fuss on drugs in UK. Despite the fuss, victims of this punishment finish their sport career at all. Amators of human rules highlight the austerity of this punishment ant the lack of educative element in this commitment. Mutatis mutandis in UK this system is working. There is no on occasion of drug use was not fixed until the acceptance of this law.
To summerise I have no professional opinion about this relevant problem, but as a defender of human rules, and the adherent of educative model of punishment I would agree with the first opinion. I have no doubts in great efficiency of the second one, but I think that educative part for every human is much more important.
