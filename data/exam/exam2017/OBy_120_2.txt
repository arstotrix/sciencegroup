There is no secret that many people all over the world copy and share music and films on the Internet instead of buying them. That’s why musicians and producers lose huge amounts of money per year.

On the one hand, there is huge quantity of people who can’t buy films or music, such as students, elderly man and women, poor males and females, children. But they want to get an education, for example in films school, or just see education movie. These groups of people just have no ability to pay for these things. For instance, Andry Tarkovskiy grow up in poor family, but he had no enough money to watch movies, that’s why he tries to do it without payment. The other example is our grandparents from the Sovet Union. They copied films and saw abroad films, because they were very interested in other culture. 

On other hand, producers, musicians, costume designers made the great work. They spent their time on making film or song, so they can be payed. When you have done the work it is normally to get money for it. But in this occasion a lot of people does not do it, so the expences cannon be covered. For example, if someone steal products from the shop, this person must be punished because it is breaking the law. For instance,  when the Samsung steak the design of new Iphone and produced nearly the same phines, the Iphone company submit in court and the Samsung payed a huge amount of money.

To sum up, in my opinion, person who copying or sharing music or films should be punished, but not arrested. I guess it is normal to consist them to pay fee.
