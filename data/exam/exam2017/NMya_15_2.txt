In the modern world there is a dangerous trend: youth becomes more involved in crimes, robberies and frauds, than it used to be before.
There are several possible causes of this development, but the main reason is obviously the spread of computer games. Nowadays a teenager do not face problems with access to computer shooters and digital mazes full of bloody monsters. These games teach youngsters how to kill. Faced with murders and violence in computer games, teenager considers anger as a normal way of acting. The difference between the reality and imagined world is gone for young people. That is why story, when a child with axe murders family for prohibiting playing computer, exists.
Another reason of such trend can be the lack of opportunity for young people. Youngsters, struggling with self-realisation, and suffer from lack of motivation, see no solution of their situation, except committing a crime. On the labour market young experts are not demanded. It is hard for them to find job.
However, paying more attention to child’s activity can easily solve the problem. If parents and teachers pay attention to teenager’s development, interests and education, the trend will probably decrease. What is more, computer games are the sign of boredom, that is why it is important to provide youngster with extra courses. Person who finished high education, has less chance to commit a crime. Statistic, provided by developed countries, shows that crucial amount of crimes involve people without education.
To sum up, if parents want to prevent their child from crimes and prizon, they need to pay attention to his or her education and provide different opportunities as free-time activities.
