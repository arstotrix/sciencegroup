Almost everything can be found in Web nowadays: many people download a huge amount of files every day. But what about the copyright? Autors of films, books and music pieces can not get money for their work if it was published illegally by pirates. Are users which download illegal content guilty too?
Actually the most musicians earn money nowadays by playing live concerts which fans visit anyway – no matter whether they have records of the last album or not. The most part of film makers’ salary contains of money recieved by them from the cinemas, not from selling copies of the film for home watching. The lose of money because of pirates is not so great as it seems to be. There is a lot of ways to encourage the author of a song or of a film you like. On the one hand, if you first buy and you are able to listen or to watch, you cannot say beforehand that you will like it. For people it were more reasonable first to try (to download a free copy) and then to donate to the author if the film or the song is really good. On the other hand, a lot of people like to use free copies of their favorite films and music pieces without any donation to the authors. Pirates uploaded these files to the internet but is using it honest?
So, I am partly agree with the opinion that users which download illegal content must be punished. I suppose they have a right to try the product before buying it. But if they found the content pleasant and want to continue using it – they must “say thanks” to the autors.
