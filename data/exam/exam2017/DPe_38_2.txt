Nowdays there are a lot of problems with internet pirates who steal music and films which leads to a huge losses for producers. In my opinion, such question is very dabatable. That’s why my essay will discuss, firstly, why pirates should be punished, and, secondly, reasons to copy and share music or films on the internet.
It’s agreed that copying and sharing original media content is illegal. There are several laws in Russia that try to control these internet segment. For example, there is special government organisathion that blocks resourses with illegal materials. In that case, it is not a secret that it is easier to buy a film in the official store, becouse other way you lose several advantogies. With this in mind , let’s think about the quality of this content and the moral norms. As for my family, we prefer to see a film in the good resolution and we don’t want to break the rulers when we decide to watch a new movie or listen new album.
On the other hand, there are some reasones to download music of movies from the unofficial store. The main point is that we should take into accont that we live in Russia and sometimes it closes the oppotunities to find an alboum or a movie from very small foreign group or with unpopular actors. For instance, It is too difficult to find The Big Bang theory in Russian stores and also in our language. In that case, we don’t have another oppotunities and have to dounload and translate it from unofficial resources. Moreover, these Russian laws sometimes play the role of instrument for small media producers to earn money from illegal stores or, even more often, from fan cites.
To sum up, this question have different sides, but, In my opinion, there should be no illegal media at all.
