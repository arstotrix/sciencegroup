Pirate copies of films and music and other files, like computer programs or games is big problem today. People download files in the internet, listen pirate music and watch pirate movie. I agree that coping and sharing files on the internet is theft. I think, people should bue the original files, it they need quality files. People who buying the original discs, pay attention by authority rights gibe big influence for culture. All job should be paying. Musicians and film producers lose a lot of money for their projects every year. They give us good music and interesting films, make our life more colorful. We should try to give them money for their work. I think that problems can be resolvd if prices of original discs will be smal and confortable for people.
