The graph contains information about the book market develoment in the USA, Germany, China and the UK in 2014 and a prediction for 2018.
The main idea is that printed books will be still popular even in 2018 with a slightly fall in all countries exept for Germany.
Firstly, the USA has the biggest book market and the most significant changes can be noticed here. It is forecasted to fall from 10,5 to 7,5 billion US dollars for printed books, while eBooks market expected to grow from 5,5 to 8,5. In other countries situation is going to remain almost the same, expesially in the UK. We can see that numbers will slightly change for both categories.
To sum up, I would like to say that nevertheless printed book are still popular, eBook's market is developing and the forecast claim that even with the small steps but weâ€™ll buy more and more eBooks every year.
