The graph illustrates how often social nets are used among people of different ages in the USA. Actually, the graph shows us three categories of the age: from 18 to 29, from 30 to 49, from 50 to 64 and 65 and more.
According to the graph, the most popular social net among all age groups is Facebook, but it is especially popular among young people at the age from 18 to 29 (87%).Secondly, it is clear from the graph that LinkedIn is used more by adults rather than Instagram. Furthermore, it is a significant difference in the usage of these social nets between age group from 50 to 64 and 65+: 30% of people aged from 50 to 64 prefer to use LinkedIn, and only 11% of them use Instagram. We can see the similar situation among people aged 65+: 22% of them use LinkedI while only 6% prefer Instagram.
Summing up, social nets are very popular among the youth, while elders use them not so often.
