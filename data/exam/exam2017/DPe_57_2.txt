Nowdays with the help of the Internet people can easily find any music and films they want. But also they can find pirate copies and get for free. Some people think that this is crime and pirates have to be punished. Others tells that art have to be free.
In my opinion, pirates moves all industry of music and cinema forward. For example the huge part of teenagers have no money to buy hundreds of songs and albums. But when they have chance to get it for free they find their favourite bands, songs and give chance for unknown musiciants become famous. There are thousands examples of bands who gives their music for free, they find it like a way to introduce their art to huge auditory Anyway the main part of musician money is money from tickets, that means if more people will hear you, more people will come to the show and band will get more money.
Thatâ€™s how pirates help bands and whole industry. The only chance for groups to make a lot of money is to make good music and great shows. Also I like the Idea how Apple solve problems with pirates, they make all music on Apple music free, but enter for month costs some money, this is one more way to overcome problem.
In the end I would like to say that there are a lot of ways win over the pirates and punishing is not one of them.
