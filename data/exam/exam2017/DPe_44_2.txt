Nowadays, it is a huge problem for the film and music industries that many people use their products as songs, films, serials illegal just by downloading these files from special sites. Some people think that there should be a law which punishes the illegal copying of music and films.
I partly agree with this point of view. On the one hand, musicians and film makers spend a lot of time and money on producing something interesting and unusual for the auditory. Creators as all other workers should have some salary for their work. It can be gathered by buying music en CDs and films to the cenema centres. But because of the power of Internet and programmers who can find such songs and films the musicians and film produces loose the ability to get some money for their work and sleepness nights in office. It means that programmers and people who download files are in the side of criminal and they should be punished for that.
On the other hand, there a lot of people who can not allow themselves to buy legal music and films because of their high price. Sources with intertainment content require huge payment per month. In Apple music, iTunes, Google music almost all music is too expensive that people decide not to buy it but, maybe, buy goods for family instead of new song. What is more, tickets in the cenemas also is too expensive for ordinary people. Maybe because of these facts people choose not to buy original copy but to download for free.
I personally think that copying and sharing is a theft but not so awful like killing people Music and film produces should adjust a price (make it lower) for products of this industry in order to solve this problem of illegal copying.
