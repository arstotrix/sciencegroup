I think, every citizen of my country has heard something about Hollywood and almost everyone of them has seen at least one American or British film. Personally I have grown up on American animation. That is why in the little age I already knew who scouts are, what marshemellow is, some parts of American history and culture. People like me from different countries all over the world are one of the evidences that British and American film industry has a huge popularity. What are reasons for this?
Firstly, English is an international language and, talking about foreign films, people in many countries can watch films in English, but not in Chinese or in Russian.
Secondly, I do not really know what is wrong with filmaking in my country, but it is more likely to find great and deep American or British film than Russian one. If some Russian film is really good, that is always because of the plot and some message, not because of visual effects. An impressive visual part is one of the reasons of American and British films' popularity.
Although, I do not think that the matter is in financial support. Many Russian films had great support from government, and that didn't help at all. Sometimes people who make films in Russia just take these money from government for their own needs, and their films appear to be awful. In contrary, there are a lot of awesome films made with no government support at all.
All in all, locally produced films also can be great masterpieces. What about financial support, there should be fair competition for getting it, and in this case it can be useful.
