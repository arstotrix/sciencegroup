Our sociaty always have crime. We have a lot of books, films, diaries etc. about it. During all history people try to fight with it. We had inovated a big and difficult system of the judgement, had wrote a great amount books with laws. Nevertheless, people can not "crime" even in the modern world. Do we have at least one way to reduce crime? Let us think about it.

Many people think the best way to increase crime is to give longer prison sentences. From my point of view, it is not a great idea. If person have courage to do some wrong ations he\she do it. Poople who think about crime know that they will be punishment. And for them there is no difference how mach time they will spend in the prison.
I strongly believe, that the only fear of the death can reduce the crime. All people afraid of it. If The person knows that punishment for his actions is death, he will do everything to avoid it. Moreover, there will no possibility to leave a prison earlier. It will be a magnificent "lesson" for everyone who do not think about rights of other peopel and laws.
Of course, a lot of people сan say that it is so cruel and we have no rights to kill people even if he or she is a killer who brought a great amount of lives. Besides, this moral scheme does not work in the real life. It is ugly, but people are animals that think only about thamselves.

To sum up, for me it is obviously that the best way to decline crime is the fear of the death. Live is the most important thing for all of us and each person do everything to save it.
