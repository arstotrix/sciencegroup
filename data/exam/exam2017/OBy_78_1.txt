According to a chart we can get the information about goods: first we can see the frequently transported goods but each sphere. By analysing the chart we can say that most of the goods listed in te chart transported by road. On the other hand machinery and metals are more popular to transport by rail. Machinery more than 12% transported by rail while by road only 2. Metals on the 24% transported by rail more than by road. Food on the other hand is more likely to be transported by road, to clarify on 20% more than by rail. Manufactured goods are almost the same of each category. Chemicals get more transported by road than by rail. And finally non-metallic minerals. In the first chart (which provides us with information about goods thatâ€™s transported by rail) we can see that percentage of non-metallic minerals not even listed, while the second chart shows that 13% of non-metallic minerals transported by road.

To conclude everything that I mentioned, we can say that more than a 50% of all the listed goods are transported by road in 2008. But most of the machinery and metals transported by rail. And because of the information we hot we can say that both sphere of transportation are importantin out lives.
