The graph illustrates the percentage of adults of different ages using social networking sites in the USA.

As can be seen from the chart, there are three major social networks used by Americans - Facebook, Instagram and LinkedIn. The majority of people using Facebook are aged 18 and up to 29 with 87%. The 65+ age group tends to go for this social network less with only 56%. However, it is evident that Facebook is the most popular site among all three given. Instagram is used by 53% of the 18-29 age group, which is also the majority for this particular network. But it is unpopular among those of the age of 65 and above (with only 6% of them using this app). LinkedIn is equally used by those of the age groups 18-29 and 65+ with 22% for each of them. The majority of people using this platform are of the age of 30-49 and 50-64 (with 31% and 30% respectively).

Overall, it can be noticed that Facebook is the leading site among people of different ages.
