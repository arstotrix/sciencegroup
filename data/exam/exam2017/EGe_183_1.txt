The charts illustrate the change in the way of using Facebook between 2012 and 2013 and the main reasons for choosing Facebook for male and female audience. In the first chart it can be seen that the quantity of people using the desktop version of Facebook did not significanlty change and only dropped a little - from 145 millions of users to about 130 millions. However, the number of mobile users in 2013 grew almost twice compared to 2012, changing from about 60 million users to about 100 million users. The second chart shows what was the main reason of using Facebook for men and women. The most popular reason, sharing photos and videos, was more important to female audience than to men audience, as well as other reasons, such as seeing funny posts and learning about ways to help each other. However, receiving updates was an equally important reason for using Facebook for users of the both sexes.
