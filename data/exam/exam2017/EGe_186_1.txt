The given graph gives information about the average time men and women in England spent doing sport and exercise in 2012 depending on their age.

Overall, the bar chart shows a downward trend: the older a person was the less sport he or she did. Additionaly, men generally spent more time doing sport than women. The most active age group was young people aged 16-24. Male members of this group spend approximately 282 minutes doing exercise while young females spend 114 minutes. People over 75 years did not do much exercise and their activity lasted for not more than 29 and 10 minutes for men and women correspondently.
The only exception which disagrees with the average trend is age group 55-64 where women did a bit more exercise than men. One more interesting detail is that the average time 24-34-year-old did sport was approximately twice less than in a younder age group (16-24). In other age groups the decline was more or less steady.
