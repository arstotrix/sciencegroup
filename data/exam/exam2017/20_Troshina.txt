Nowadays doping in sport is more widespread than ever. Some people believe that such sportsmen who were caught using illegal drugs should be banned from official competitions temporarly. For example, two years. Others claim that these athelets mustn't take part in any competitions forever. As for myself, I would support the first opinion. Firstly, these athelets who were caught using doping are not only banned from competing proffesionally but also shamed by society a lot. So they are practically penylized twice. To my mind, it's enough to prevent further attempts. Secondly. sometimes sportsmen don't even know that they are using forbidden sypplies. That was the pars of the doping scandal with russian athelets last summer, some of them didn't even know about it. So why should we ban them for the rest of their lives? On the other hand, I can understand people who believe that if sportsmen has done it on purpose they should be banned for the rest of their lives. They've done it so they don't care about rules and other important things in the world of sport competitions. Moreover, there are some athelets who have been caught twice or more times. I think, such people shouldn't take part in any competitione Ever again, because they don't admire the rules, that they have to obey. To sum up, I would like to say that if the sportsman made a mistake once he deserved to be forgiven.
