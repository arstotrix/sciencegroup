The given graph illustrates how the population of the United States was changing during 250 years.
In 1750 there were less than one million of people in USA. During next fifty years, the number of people increased slightly, but still remained on approximately same level. Till 1800 the birth rate exceeded the death rate on same level. In 1800 the level of birth declined slightly, while the level of death dropped dramatically. The population reached 25 million in 1850, when the difference between birth rate and death rate was the most remarkable. This year was followed by a sudden grow of population, there already were 80 millions of people in 1900. This year birth rate still declined, but death rate started to fluctuate. In the first half of 20th century the population surged by 150 million. For next fifty years the level of birth bounced back, the number changed remarkably and reached its peak in 2000 with approximately 300 million.
In conclusion, I would like to say that the number of citizens in USA increased moderately for 150 years and grew fast in 20th century, but we should mention that for all this years the birth rate exceeded the death rate, which helped the grow.
