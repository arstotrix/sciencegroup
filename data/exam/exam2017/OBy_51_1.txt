The graphic pie shows amount of some good which are moved by rail and by road between countries in Eastern Europe in 2008.

As can we see, amount of metal take the bigger part at a chart. But this high percent of moved metal are actual only for rail kind of transportation. On the one hand, we can say that metal is more popular, than other goods, but second chart illustrate that the amount of metals transported by road is extremely smaller than metals transported by rail and takes only 11% by all goods transported by road.

However, percent of manufactured goods transported by rail is similar to percent of manufactured goods transported by road. This two kinds of good compare only in two per cents.

Also a big feature is  near food products, because percent of food transported by rail is smaller than percents of food transported by road.

Based on this information, we can make a conclusion that the most popular goods, which are transported by rail is some manufactured goods and metal, and a car make transportation of food products even often.
