There are so huge amont of money loses every year from musicians and film producers pockets. It is caused by illegal pirate copies. People who theft music or films from internet, from pirates resourses should be punished, instead human, who bougth the original version of entertainment. Is that right? Letâ€™s talk about this.
In my opinion, there are so many humans, who cannot buy legal version of film or music, because they have finanshial problems. Especially it is happened in poor countries, where a law of publishing is not exist and everyone can download everything he/she want from pirate resourses. How to punish all of population. If every film or music are situated in open acess. For other reason, It is easier to write your own music or do film, then to pay a lot of money for every film, or for musical album. I think that some musicians and producers offer their entartainments for expensive amont of money and most of the people, who has a open acess to this, prefer to go to pirates resourses that will pay for it.
It is well known, that people have to pay for music and films in some contries, because the law of protecting rights is there, and almost there humans always want to punish illegal content.
In conclusion, I think that there should be a special law, regulating buying and solding content. Only in this case punishing can exist.
