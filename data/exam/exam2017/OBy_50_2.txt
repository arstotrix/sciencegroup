Nowadays, there is a popular opinion that technological progress and gadgets as its consequence have a hurmful influence on people related to their health. Unfortunately, it is true, but it is really hard to find a direct solvation.

To begin with, the most widespread illness is blindness and harm on eyes and view. Most contemporary world population uses mobile phones and depends on them. We can see enormous amount of young people mostly who spend all time on chatting and surfing in the Internet. As a consequence, these people lose their good view and thus need to wear glasses. Moreover, mobile, computer and TV screen affects our brain and destroys it through our eyes. For instance, I know people who have a frequent headache because of endless looking at their smartphones.

As I have already mentioned, the problem of rising amount of illnesses is hart to solve. However, it is real to reduce these illnesses. Firstly, the young generation is affected by new technologies more than others. So parents should make gaps for their children in using of mobile phones. At the same time, it is better to make kids read books because itâ€™s more useful and developing activity. Secondly, it is necessary to invent harmless screens that would not destroy our eyes. For example, there are some inventions, like protecting glasses, that stop harmful influence from computer or mobile phone. Moreover, they make you more fashioned, but their essential meaning is protecting, of course.

In conclusion, problems with health caused by technologies really exist. However we can help ourself by ourselves and buy things to protect our eyes and brain. Surely, we should reduce our smartphones using in the first place.
