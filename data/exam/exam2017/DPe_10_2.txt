There is no doubt that nowadays industry of media has gained great popularity all over the world Everyone wants to watch movies, series and listen to music but far not everyone wants to pay for it. Some people tend to think that people who connected with copying, saving and sharing illegal copies should be imposed punishment. I completely disagree with this point of view.
Firstly, rapid spreading of free copies of films and music is one of the steps to the world where culture destination of the planet is acceptable to everyone. Free access to music and films it is a good chance to enjoy beautiness, improve taste and become more educated even foe those who can’t afford to go to cinemas, concert halls and buy CDs or DWDs.
The second argument is that trying to catch all who is connected with illegal copies of films and music it is a wasting of time and money. In the modern internet “pirates” can easily hide themselves. File that was deleted will be recover again soon. Much more productive is to make payment for internet a little bit higher and send part of this money to producers and musicians. Moreover producers of mass media still receive huge amount of money from films in cinemas and big concerts of musicians. People don’t stop to bring money them.
To draw a conclusion I should say that world receive from spreading free copies of media products more than lose. Producers still go in profit, but people have more access to culture destination.
