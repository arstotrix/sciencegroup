Every day governments try to improve any sphere of our life and to decide global problems in our world. The most dangerous issues in our society are air pollution and global warming. We know that air travel gives us a great danger and we will be in a huge risk in the future if we do not decide this problem. People consider that governments should introduce laws that can be reduced the myriad of air travel for business or leisure. Let consider is it right statement or not.
Undoubtedly, we are face to face with a big problem because if a lot of air travel, that conributes global warming and air pollution, is unnecessary and we are just wasting it, goverments will have find solution of it. Almost a half of population supposes that it has to be not a good decision reducing the amount of air travel for business. I have the same opinion as people will want to make a lot of money on it and it will be a struggle for success.
Moreover, it can take a lot of time and money for introducing laws because it is a long process even for goverments. Every days they make some laws for solution of some problems and only a part of it has been introduced. It is also a great risk for society as business leads to some dangerous situations between people. For instance, every year we are trying to have a good relationship with other countries. If air travel reduces for leisure or business, all countries will fight with each other and we will get a lot of enemies because people always desires to make the best situations for their country.
However, governments should decide the issue because we are still in danger.The rik of global warming develops every day more and more.
To sum up, this statement has advantages and disadvantages.Goverments should compare them and decide how much we will lose and get success for our society if it reduces for the sphere of business.
