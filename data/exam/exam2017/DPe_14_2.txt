Copyright legistation has appeared not so long ago but it erases a lot of debates now being a very controversial issue. Some people think that illegal copying of music or films should be regarded as theft and be punished in the same way. But it does not seem unreasonable to believe that copying has nothing in common with the real theft.
The strongest arguement in favour of this position is that such art works as songs, films and books should be spread around the world as wide as it possible instead of being restricted to copy. It is supposed that the Internet should provide people an opportunity to see what they cannot see live or to hear what they cannot hear in the concerthall. Nevertheless, the copyright legislation does not conduce films or songs of any time be recongnised in the whole world without charging any fee.
Although the idea of free copying and sharing music and films seems to be very attractive, It cannot be ignored that to create art is someoneâ€™s job and he or she earns for living this way. Pirate copies make them loose their money regardless how much a producer or a musician earns.
Taking into account everything that was mentioned it can be concluded that despite the fact that copyright legislation is very important as it protects producers and musicians, it should not be so straightforward and regard copying as a crime. Measures should be taken to make laws concerning the copyright not so strict and harsh.
