Problem of illegal pirate copies is one of the most widely known, because of public speaches of musicians, film producers and some other creative people.
There is an opinion that people who download these copies should be punished. I agree with this point of view. These essay will bring arguments for this.
The worth of such copies is low, so people try to get inspiration from a bad product. For example, once I downloaded film “Pirates of Caribbean” and couldn’t watch it more than two minutes because of strange sounds broken graphics and problems with downloading, so I decided to go to the cinema and pay for good time.
It is inhabitant for people, particularly russians, to pay for every kind of information and ability to find free film or music, or software just makes this problem harder to solve it. Because of this, information lose its unique value for customers. For example, Daniel Roshar got a few sells of product “WinPar” that was invented by him, meanwhile millions of people have it for free.
The third argument is ability to get harmful software while pirate files download. “Virus”-program can break down your “Windows” at all, or delete files from your computer. And such situation is a real danger, because the biggest amount of dangerous software is spreaded by this way.
To conclude, internet becomes bad place with such files and people who download these files should be punished. In a real life, only some people will become hitten, because the biggest part of citizens is going to avoid this and start to buy legal copies from official sites and such resources like “appstore”. Everyone will get profit except some pirates resources and virus-programmists, but we shouldn’t think about their losses.
