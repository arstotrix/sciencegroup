Nowadays popular artists suffer a lot from pirating the media content. If results in a huge money losses and a big stress for authors. I absolutely agree thot copying and sharing music or films on the internet is a crime, which should lead to punishment. My essay will discuss why pirating is bad for musicians and film producers and how copyrighters are trying to fight with illegal copying.
As have been already mentioned the illegal pirate copies are a big problem for profit of artis, but also it harry their popularity and digrity. We have seen a lot of cases, when the album or film comes out earlier in the internet than in theaters or in the shops. Artists make a lot of work to make their pieces look perfect and a marketing campaign, which is closely connected to dates when something comes out, plays a vital role. A good example of this is illegal release of the final episode of the BBC’s drama “Sherlock”. The creators had a lot of problems with preventing spoilers for the big audience.
Copyrighters of course try to fight with this problem. The most obvious way is to create laws, which make copying illegal, but it is hard to find the criminal and to punish him. The other way is to create good incentives and environment for people to not to use pirate copies. Such services as Spotify, Apple Music, etc. are a really good example. They give users an opportunity to listen legal music for a small month fee, which is affordable for the most of the people.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that society should help policy makers to prevent pirating. If every citizen will think about illegal sharing as a crime, the copying and pirating will be a big shame and no one will do this.
