The evidence seems to suggest that modern film and music industries suffer from the private activity. Although, some people treat that fact neutrally or even support the idea of free aquiring of the files they want, there is a law in almost all the counties worldwide that is supposed to punish such initiatives and, to my mind, it is the only way to preserve some artist’s exclusive rights and help the industies to keep developing.
To start with, illegal copying of somebody’s piece of art is undoubtedly equal to the ordinary theft at least because the music people record and the movies they film are their sources of getting money, while the developed pirate activity nowadays make the producers and musicians loose a huge part of the profit they deserve. Therefore, it is simply not fair to litteraly make such people be unpaid for the work they have already done.
Moreover, the pirate activity impacts harmfully on the development of such spheres as film-making industry and music, since it weakens the incentives of artists, to some extent, to make better products in the future, since the files downloaded by fans fofree while they are supposed to be purchased for money is the feedback from the audience that goes with no respect.
To conclude, all the people who are eager to listen to music or watch movies have to reset their mindset considering the perception of both of those things as the same work as, for example, doctor or economist, which means it should not be paid and not partially. Fortunately, there such platforms as, for instance, Apple Music which make the legal audio files availiable just for the small fixed fee per month let alone such additional advantages as personal playlists and the new music advised according to the one’s interests.
