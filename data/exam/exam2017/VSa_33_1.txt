The pie charts show the percentage of different types of goods transported by rail and by road between Eastern European countries in 2008.
Overall, it is evident that railroads are used primarily for the transportation of metals, while the main goods transported by drive roads are food products.
By taking a closer look at the charts it can be seen that machinery and metals comprise for just below half of all goods transported by rail, while road transportation of these two types of goods is only of 13% if summarised.
In comparison, the amount of food transported by driving roads is more than two times larger than this of food products transported by railroads. Aside from this distribution, the quantities of manufactured goods transported by rail and roads are relatively similar.
