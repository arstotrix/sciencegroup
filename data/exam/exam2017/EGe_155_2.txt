Nowadays, the percentage of crimes commited by teenagers is significantly high.
There is an infinite number of problems that can play the role of incentives. In this essay I would like to discuss some of the ways that can help to overcome this development.
First of all, speaking about my personal judgment, the main cause of discussed problem is problems in families. Sometimes teenagers face domestic violence that can affect various aspects of their life and, as a result, they consider such behaviour as normal and act accordingly not only at home. Our parents are the ones who are the role models for us and if they do not behave appropriately, their children would think that they should also behave as them.
Secondly, the underlying cause of teenagers' acts against the law is some violent games among peers. It is a common trait of young people to try to be cooler than everyone else. Some of them are stealing clothes in order to be in trend and that noone would banter them because of their appearence.
Speaking about ways that can help to overcome this problem, firstly, it is essential for parents to understand their significant role in developing their childrens' charachers. Some lectures can be provided for those adults who have children where this problem will be discussed. What is more, teenagers spend most of their time in schools. Therefore, teachers can influence them too. It is vital for young people to know that they should not listen to their peers as they are not role models for them. So this topic can be discussed on some seminars. Thus, from the first grade they will be aware of some problems that can raise, as the result, of bad behaviour.
Taking everything into consideration, there are numerous reasons why teenagers are involved in the crimes. Despite of this fact, some tactics can be deployed in order to bypass this development.
