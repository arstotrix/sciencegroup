The bar chart demonstrates the ratio of unemployment people to the whole population in several regions in two different years.
The biggest amount of people who does not have a job according to the chart is in poor regions like Northen Africa (12,5%) in both 2014 and 2015 years. In Middle East there are a little bit less such people, but anyway it is too high comparing to the numbers of the world (5,9%). From the diagram also we can see that in a such developed region as EU unemployment rate is still higher than the worldâ€™s one (7,5 and 7,9% to 5,9%).
On the other hand the bar chart provides information that the only region from represented ones which has unemployment rate lower than 5,9 is surprisingly South Africa. It remains the same from 2014 and 2015 and is 3,9%.
Overall, the highest indicator of unemployment remains in 2015 in Northen Africa, while the lowest one in South Africa from the information represented in this bar chart.
