People prefer take thing for free instead of buying something. For example, people like to took art or intertaiment for free too: musicians and film producers lose theirs money because of illegal pirate copies, what people like download instead of buying originals. I do not agree with opinion, that people, who download pirate copies of films or music on the Internet are thifths and should be punished.

Firstly, art is not goods. People make art because they want to share with others theirs ideas and knowledges. Artist, musicians or film directors do not think about money, if they have true talants. They earn money from other job, not from art.

Secondly, we have other music and films, what are not art. It is just intertainment. People can buy tickets in the cinema or on consert for this kind of music and films. Producers can earn money from this and people can take pleasure. 

Finally, I think, that people, who download pirate copies, are not thifts. They do not bad things like kidneping or killing of old woman. They just want to know about art and life or pleasure. Of course, producers struggled of this situatuin, but they can do chipper projects for people. In my opinion, they spend a lot of money on films or music, what are not good. Nowadays, we have bad concept for big money. I thing, it is wrong situation. We can spend not many many for art and it will be good.
