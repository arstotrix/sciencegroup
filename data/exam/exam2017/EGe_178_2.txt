Nowadays, a large quantity of people thiks that spending money on different space programs is a waste of money and this money could be spent better in different domains. But is it as unnececesary, as they think?

The space exploration begins in 1950 and it was a huge step for the humanity. A lot of tecnologies such as concentrated food and video conversations were firstly developed for space exploration and nowadays they are used everywere. Consequently, a lot of modern vays of communication became possible only when scientist invented the artificial satelites. For instance, the GPS-navigation became possible only when all this satelites were sent into the space.

With the developpement of space exploration humans have send a lot of junk in the space. Our planet is surrounded by broken satelites, rockets etc. But this problem can be solved with the invention of the multi-use rockets by Elon Musk. The gases that are prodused when the rocket fuel burns are also very dangerous for the environement, and in the procces of building a rocket base a lot of trees were destroyed. For example, when the famous rocket base Boykonur were build, a lot of forests were destroyed.

To sum up, it is important to say that the space exploration plays a huge role in our daily lives and the gouvernement need to spend money on this. In my opinion, the governement could spend even more money on space exploration by hepling the private developpements such as Elon Musk program.
