Nowadays people have two opinions about the prisoniers and about people who make crimes. They separetes in two groups. One group thinks that the best way to reduce crimes is to give long prison sentences.Another group thinks that they become better if they are given alternative methods of reducing crime.
The first method can be effective, but it does not give us the garantie of their changes. They can have a long prison sentence, be in prison, make there works, hard works and after that, for example,after 25 years, they will not realise what they have done bad, for them it can be only a crime and they can do it one more time. Also, I do not want to say that all people behave themselves at the same way. After a long prison time they can be better, because they want to forget that bad time and live a new life.
Others think about alternrtive methods. Yes, it can be effective, they can realize what they have done, but they can think if they killed one person and do not have prison sentences, they will can kill another person and will not have a punishment. The same situation with changes can be and in this sutuation when the prisoner has an alternitive punishment and after that way of reducing crime they can be more lifefriendly and want to forget all this time.
In my opinion, I think that better way to reduce the crimes is to give longer prison sentenses. For me, Killer, Who killed a lot of people, must be in a prison, because I do not want that one of them was among us. It is dangerous for people. Also, I think that every person would like to punish this person who killed someone, because bad emotions Fulfill us and we want give to this killer all, that can give him the same felling that we have at this bad moment.
