Nowadays a lot of people are sure that professional sportsmen who have taken illegal drugs are to be banned for a concrete period of time. However, other think that such athletes must be dismissed forever. This essay will discuss both points of view.
I can say without any hesitation that professional sportsmen, caught with taking illegal drugs, should not be banned for a whole career. Firstly, a lot of professional athletes are really young and the end of their career may look like the end of their lives. Sportsmen are the people, who devote all their time, all their skills and all their life to trainings. If they are banned forever, they won't be able to do something instead of sport. Secondly, banning for a limited period of time will, from my point of view, help sportsmen to realize their mistake. Banning from competing frofessionally for athletes is like sending to prison for ordinary people. The main idea of it is to reabelatize, to correct the mistake. Finally, sportsmen can't even aware of the fact that they are taking illegal drugs. For instance, it happened with Maria Sharapova. She was just taking medicine including banned meldony to cure. She didn't know that it was banned. As the result, she was banned for 2 years.
Nevertheless, some people suppose that professonal athletes who have taken illegal drugs ought to be banned for the rest of their lives. They say that such sportsmen run the spirit and honor of competing. What is more, such people believe that it is dishonored to their opponent. Cheating athletes must be banned forever to set a good example to other sportsmen.
In conclusion, I should stress again that I am in favor of banning athletes from competing professionally for a certain period of time. However, the issue of punishment for taking illegal drugs is rather controversial and I do not think that there will be a 100% agreement with one of represented points of view.
