The given graphs provide data on annual temperatures in Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro.
The first important tendency is that climate difference between the cities is huge. For example, over the span the temberature in Rio de Janeiro is quite steady and does not go under +15 degrees (the lowest point is fixed in july), while the "Russian" graph slightly grows, reaches its peak and then slowly goes down, and the minimal temperature in Yakutsk is lower than -40 degrees (in january and december).
The second pattern is that the highest level of heat is almost equal - between +25 and +30. However, the warmest climate in Brazil is noticed in winter months (january and december); as for Russia, the highest temperature is shown in summer (july).
Overall, it is obvious that the climate situation in two countries has visible differences. The temperature of Rio de Janeiro does not really fluctuate during the year but Yakutsk shows logically cold weather in winter and the warm one in summer.
