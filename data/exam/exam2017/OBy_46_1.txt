The given charts provide us with the information about the goods transported by rail and by road in Eastern Europe in 2008.

It is evident that manufactured goods make up about a fourth of goods transportation both by rail and by road – 25% in the first case and 28% in the second. 

By looking at the charts we can also tell that it is more convenient to transport metal by rail than by road because it makes up 35% of goods transported in the first chart and a mere 11% in the second, whereas for things like food products and non-metallic minerals transportation by road is on contrast, almost popular means – 30% against 11% of rail transportation in the first case and 13% against about 5% of rail transportation.

The transportation of chemicals, however, remains almost the same in both charts – 11% of rail transportation and just a bit more – 16% of goods transportation by road.
