Our modern world develops rapidly, that is why we can see the widespread use of modern techology all over the world. And sometimes it is causing problems with health.
One of the biggest problem for our health is that modern technologies make our life easier and more simple, that is why people started to have less activity. For example if we want to meet our friends and speak with them, just for fan, we will call them by phone or skype or something like that. But we lose the opportunity to go for a walk with them. Moreover, modern technologies allwed us to sit on one place and do everything we want or we need. With this reason, people become lazy, and fat. These arguments provide people's illnesses. For example overweight. This kind of illness makes people very unactive.
Another health problem which is the result of influence of modern technologies is a problem with eyers. People started watch their phomes, TV's, computers too much.
But with the help of modern technologies, people can solve these problems with health. Technologies develop in medicine sphere, that is why people started to live longer and happier. Nowadays, there are a lot of hospitals all over the world which can help with overweight or with problem's eyers and so on.
In conclusion, widespread of modern technologies has more positive effect than negative. I consider, that in the nearest future technologies will give us an opportunity to solve all our problems with health and people start to live more than 150 years.
