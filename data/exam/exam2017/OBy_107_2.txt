To begin with, I would like to say, that it is true, that every year musicians and film producers lose huge amounts of money from illegal pirate copies, but I can’t agree, that copying and sharing music or films on the internet is bad and should be punished. For my opinion, musicians and film producers should be thankful to people, sharing theire products on the Internet, because they made for them a land of commercial. It is difficult not to agree, that in such industry doesn’t matter if it is music, film making, art or smth else, PR plays one of the main role, and of course, much more people can learn more about your work, your movies, music tracks and so on if it is free. 

For example, many years age I have watched the movie ‘Transpporting’ in the Internet and I loved it very much. This year then the second part of this movie appeared. I went on it to the cinema. May be, I will never watch this movie if I didn’t find it one day in the Internet, so, I wouldn’t go to the cinema and, at the result, the producer didn’t get money for it.

The same situation with music. If you hear good tracks in the Interne, you will go to the concert, and musicians also will get there money.

So, in the end, summurazing my essay, I would like to say that we live in the centery of information, and nowadays Internet is the main information source. That is why I don’t think, that sharing music and disks on the Internet should be punished.

And I also think, that art (becauise movies and music is a kind of art) shouldn’t be commercial, that is why the artists should share it with people.
