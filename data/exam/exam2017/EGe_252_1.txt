The information given illustrates the average temperatures in two cities (Yakutsk and Rio de Janeiro) in a period of one year. The data are provided in Celsius per month.
At the first glance it is clear that there is no overall pattern in which temperature changes throughout the year, but there are two completely different situations in the Russian and Brazilian cities.
Firstly, it can be noticed that temperature in Rio is in general more stabilized and is never less than well above ten.The reverse situation is in cause of Yakutsk. There are obvious fluctuations during the year.
Secondly, it is evident from the graphs that temperature in Rio has only slight changes over the period of twelve months, whereas in Yakutsk average temperatures increase dramatically in summer months and then go down considerably in winter (to roughly 30 degrees below zero).
Finally, it is important to look at the highest and the lowest temperatures in both cities. In Yakutsk the temperature hit the peak in the middle of the summer (in July), while in Rio, during January and February, the average highest temperature makes up 30 degrees above zero.
Unlike in the city in Russia, where the lowest temperature is during winter months, about forty degrees below zero, the average temperature in Rio is in July (almost 17 degrees above zero).
Overall, after analyzing the information provided, it can be stated that the average maximum and minimum temperatures in two given cities are completely different. In Yakutsk hot and cold weather change each other rather radically, while there are only slight fluctuations in the average annual temperature in Rio.
