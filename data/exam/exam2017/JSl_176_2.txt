There are several points of view on reducing crime. Some tend to believe that the best way is longer prison sentences. While others argue that there are better ways. Both views have their pros and cons. Increasing prison sentences can prevent some people from doing crime as they will know about risk of spending most of their lifes in prison. But there is another side of this solution. First of all, prisons will take more money. From country budget as prison has to spend more on every prisoner. Second and may be even more important criminals will go for a higher crimes to avoid prison. For example, theift kill a man to avoid being caughted. Last problem is connected with the first one. Government will need to built more prisons to keep all criminals. It also take money from budget. But we have alternative ways? Yes, there are some other possible solutions to prevent crime. First one is reducing number of unemployed people. A lot of people go for crime just because they do not have something to it. Giving them a job can prevent them from going for crime. Second approach is to start with children. Most of the crimes start doing illegal during from the childhood. It is very important for parents or teachers, child phycologists to make sure that one do not you for a wrong road. Of course, many other steps that can help. In my opinion, longer prison sentence certainly is not the right solution, so we have to concentrate on alternative approaches and combine them for better results.
