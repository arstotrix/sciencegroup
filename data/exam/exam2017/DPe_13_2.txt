In the modern world where technological advances have entered almost every aspect of people’s lives, virtual theft is becoming more and more pronounced and alarming. One kind of such theft is the pirate copying of music and films. There are heated debates on whether it is a real crime and what punishment should the culpable face.
Personally, I believe that illegal copying and sharing of works of any form of contemporary art should not be tolerated. Producers, musicians, directors and many other professionals invest in their projects and work hard in order to release them. So, copying the materials illegally robs people of their legitimate money which they could have gained if a pirate has not opened an access.
However, I disagree that every person accused of illegal sharing deserves punishement. Those who share the works of the deceased people do not rob the artists themselves of their money. So, it essentially means that because of pirate copying people prevent money from getting in those who played no part in creating the music or the film. Thus, the artist’s work becomes the property of every member of the society. In my opinion, this is the way the system should work.
To conclude, I would like to stress that in order to find an efficient way solve the problem people should shift from punishing those who share the protected materials to thoroughly explaining those who download them why they should stop doing that. Only this scheme will eventually bring results because where there is demand there is supply.
