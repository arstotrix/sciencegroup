These pie charts provide data on the percentage of different items in Eastern Europe in 2008 transported by rail and by road.

We may see that the most popular goods in rail transportation are metals (35%), meanwhile cars are used by people more often for food products (30%). The most "uncomfortable" item for road is machinery (2%), although by rail it is transported quite often (12%), but car is the best way to deliver food (30%). However, there are common features. For example, the second popular material for both ways of transportation is manufactured goods (25% and 28%). Moreover, companies did not deliver non-metallic minerals as much as previous kind of products - it is about 10%.

To conclude, when people need to transport a huge amount of things which won't lose quality while they are delivering, they usually use a train. For others goals both transportation ways are equally useful.
