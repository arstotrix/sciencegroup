The chart illustrates how unemployment rate changed in different regions of the world. In period from 2014 to 2015.
It is evident that tendencies in selected world parts differ from each other, but if talking about worldwide, it should be said that the unemployment rate was stable and did not increase or fall from 5,9 points.
In particular the biggest rate of unemployment was in the North Africa and shown the result of 12,5 percent both in 2014 and 2015. Stability is the feature of the South Africa too as it shown 3,9 percent rate in selected years. The opposite can be said about Middle East, European Union and Latin America, but tendencies in these regions were not the same. For example, the unemployment rate in Middle East dropped down from 11 to 3,6 percent while EU experienced the growing of unemployment rate from 7,5 to 7,9 percent when can be considered as outcomes of some not relevant economic decisions.
All in all, one can say that unemployment rate in the world is pretty stable. But there are some exceptions.
