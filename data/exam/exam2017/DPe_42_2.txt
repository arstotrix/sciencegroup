Every new film or musical composition give people great opportunities to make pirate copies of them and make great sums of illegal money, stealing its from real producers. Everybody who make a deal with such material are guilty and should pay. This essay proofs that it is true but not in all aspects.
As for me, I partly agree with this opinion for some reasons. One the one hand, it is a sourse of unrespectable behaviour to the producers of the films and compositions because they had to work hard, spend lot’s of money to create their ideas and, what is more, their creations contain the souls of their makers. It is so unpleasant for creators to work for nothing, without any payback. I want to illustrate it with my own experience. I do my best in university and it is hurting feeling when I kenen that my works helps not truthful students to pass the exam, for example. They steal my creations. My work is my creation, I’m sure.
On the other hand, it is wonderful when you have no time to go to the cinema or musical concert because you study or work all day long and you can search the Internet and find new film for good cinema evening. No doubt, many students or children want to watch everything but they have not enough money for it. In this case illegal pirate copies is a way out. From my point of view, when my friends don’t want to go to the cinema with me it is more pleasunt to stay at home and exite the composition in warm armchair.
To sum up, the overall analysis can says that people should pay for every good or facility, but we live in the era of technologies and it is an essential part of it, especially if it is impossible to find the guilty one.
