More and more people today say that widespread of technology is causing an increasing number of health problems. I, for one, agree with this statement. 

Today the technology has spread so wide, we canâ€™t even live without it. We are always staring on the tiny screens of our phones, or on screens of our computers. Thisconstant staring has our eyes being focused all the time and thus provokes all the eye problems one can imagin. The quality of our eyesight falls with every day, making us wear glasses. The other problem wich comes with the modern technology is caused by our personal computers. For example, I spend a lot of time sitting in my chair before my computers screen playing games or doing my work. What is the problem here? Well, from sitting in one pose for such a long time I can get back pain, or even get a posture problem. Worst case I might even got long-lasting problems with my spine.

But how can we solve these problems? First of all, everyone working with a computer, watching their TV or using their phone should perform eye gymnastics ever so often. Basically, you should focus your sigt on something far and then spin your eyes for a bit. Secondly, if you are sitting for a long time you should stand up and do a little workout from time to time. This includes a bit of stretches, jumps and squats . On the greater scale of things, it would be great of everyone just started running in the mornings. These runs would solve a lot of physical problems for a lot of people and make health of the nation much better as a whole.
