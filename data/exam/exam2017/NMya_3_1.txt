First of all we can see that facebook is the most popular social network among the chosen ones – in each age group more than 50% of citizens use it. The second popular one is LinkedIn (105% of 400% - a sum – of people use it (for Instagram 95% only)).
Let’s look at the first social network – Facebook. This one is mostly used by members of the youngest age group (87%). Then we can see that people from the oldest age group like it less than ones from the other age groups. But the percentage use of different groups doesn’t have big gaps – every group has only about 10% difference with its neighbours.
For Instagram there is another situation. This social network is popular only among members of the youngest group (more than 50%), other people don’t like this network – less than 25% use it. in each group. LinkedIn is a network for adults. It is the only one which is not used mostly by the youngest group. It is loved by 30 – 49 and 50 – 64 groups.
It can be connected with different aims of the networks – Facebook and Instagram are mostly used for fun, LinkedIn for work. People who are 65+ years old like LinkedIn even more than Instagram.
