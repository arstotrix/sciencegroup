It is considered among a wealth of people that today youngsters do more crime actions than they used to. It is rather challenging and thought-provoking issue which should be taken into account by parents and teachers.

I suppose that an abundance of factors can cause this problem. Firstly, many children receive poor attention from their parents today because both parents usually work full time nowadays. They would like to earn money, however, they forget about attention and care which their child needs. Secondly, such problem can be rooted in spread of video and computer games. Children and teenagers are getting used to cruelty and violence through electonic games. The boundaries between games and reality begin to blur. That is why they transfer actions from games into real life.

Parents and teachers should definetely discuss this problem in detail and come to a common agreement. I can suggest some possible solutions. The first one is to spend more free time with their children, to talk to them and to be interested in their lifes. The second thing which adults can do is to organise special activities for children where they will be under control. With the help of such activities they will learn to communicate with peers and distinguish between real and virtual life.

To conclude it can be said that although the problem is wide-spread today, there are plenty of solutions which can be offered. Parents and teachers should just pay enough attention to it.
