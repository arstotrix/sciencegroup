The bar chart presents information about how much time people in England spent on sport and exercise in 2012 by age and gender. Overall, the younger people were, the more time they spent doing sport: teenagers 16-24 years old was doing sport for 282,1 minutes in average, whereas since 25 years age this level fell down at 130 points (almost twicely). Moreover, men of all ages spent in average more time on sport than women did in 2012. The only one age level where the amount of minutes spent on sport by women was more than that one by men was 55-64 years. It is worth noticing that people over 75 years old in average doing sports, but they spent much less time for it that teenagers: seniors were doing sport and exercise for 29.2 minutes. This number is 10 times less than time spent on sports by 16-24 years old boys. Overall, time spent doing sports by women always fell slightly from young women to older ones. This amount of time reached its peak between 16-24 years old women, but its minimum was at the level of ten minutes for women over 75 years old. Time spent on sport by men boomed between groups of 16-24 (282.1 minutes) and 25-34(153.8 minutes) years old men, then this number went on falling, it achieved 114,2 minutes at the age of 45-54 and then it fell critically again (52,7 minutes for 55-64 years old men). Nevertheless, it made a small increase for 65-74 years old men and fell down again for seniors over 75 years old. Teenagers' connection with sport can be explained by having subjects like PE at the university and at school, and people that are older did sport by themselves, so they spend less time on it.
