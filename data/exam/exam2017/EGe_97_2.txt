It is believed that nowadays young people commit more crimes than ever before. In this essay I will present some causes and solutions to this problem.
Personaly, I agree with this statement for several reasons. Firstly, with the development of technology peolpe faced such problem as harmful computer games. What I mean is that some computer games can cause a lot of harm to phisical and phsicological state of a teenager. Playing in cruel computer games without stopping, young people become unable to distinguish between online world and reality and it can result in committing a crime. Secondly, nowadays parents tend to trust teenagers to chose how to spend their free time and they also do not check with whom their child hangs out. Such a modern gesture results in the fact that a teenager may be envolved in some criminal community.
In my opinion the problems presented below may be solved easily. Firstly, the government should prohibit any kind of cruel online computer games which can cause a harm to a teenager. Secondly, parents should be more envolved in theit child's life. So, that they would know with whom their child spends his or her free time. Also, some government projects may be presented in order to tell all people how important this problem is and that we should unite together in order to solve this problem.

All in all, I would like to say that if people will think about this problem more it will be real to make a difference.
