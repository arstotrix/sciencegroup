One of the issues, discussed nowadays, is the spreading of pirate copies of music and films on the internet. It is widely considered that such copying is illegal and should be punished. Still, the are some opposing points of view, that should be taken into account.
On the one hand, enormous amounts of money are not only spent by musicians and film producers on making media product, but also lost from pirate copying. In other words, media-makers don’t get as much money as they deserve for selling their product, but also suffer high costs of production. These costs should be at least partly covered by the price paid by consumers. Otherwise, such uncontrolled copying can lead to crisis in media industry. That means, that quantity and quality of media products would reduce if only rich media-producers could afford to create unit of media. For this reason, it is better to punish people, who share and download pirate copies.
On the other hand, media-makers make a lot of money for presentation of their media-products at a public places (like concerts, cinemas etc). Still, many people don’t earn enough money to spend them on pieces of culture. Unfortunately, the majoritys households income is only enough to buy good of first need, like food and cloths. If free downloading is strictly forbiden, the cultural degradation of the society may began. People, especially young one, need an access to free media products in order to discover the world, life and their personality.
To conclude, I consider that pirate copying should not be punished, as cultural development f the society must be in priority before some amount of money lost by another media producer.
