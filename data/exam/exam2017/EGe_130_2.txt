The level of commiting crimes are getting high these days among the young generation and is considered to be a huge problem which needs to be solved. Firstly, this essay, will discuss the main reason why does it happen nowadays and secondly, it will suggest some of possible solutions to deal with this hurdle.
In my opinion, I think that the main reason why the situation looks like that is because parents of those kids are some kind of laid-back people and they do not pay any attention to the development and behaviour of their children due to their own career growth or even their lazyness. I am not saying that every parent can act like this but I know a lot of families in which child can live on their own whithout any parental regardment. That is why young people can not distinguish which action is bad and which one is good. They start to use drugs or even sell them to get some money and some of them decides to make a robbery or in hard cases they can murder somebody. This fact is really terrifying.
To solve this problem, I would like to suggest government to create some social programs which would be held at schools and universities where children would be taught how to behave in society and would be given a law education of the country where they live. I think that these methods will help them to become good citizens of their contry.
In conclusion, I would like to say that we need to look after our young generation in a proper way because they are considered to be our future and we need to give them the model of how to behave in the society and then the situation with commiting crimes will change a lot in the near future.
