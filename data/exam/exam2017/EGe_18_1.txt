This bar chart depicts the percentage of online adults in the USA, who use social networks.The vertical axis shows the percentage and the horizontal one represents the age groups.

From the graph it can be clearly seen, that Facebook is the most popular social network across all age groups. Instagram follows it with 53% of active users aging from 18 to 29. But It's not so popular amongst other age groups. Next one is LinkedIn, which is a very popular means of communication amongst buisinessmen and those, who want to get employed. It's relatively well-known, and the percentage of active users from all age is quiet equal.

All in all, Facebook certainly is the most well-known site in USA across all age groups, where Instagram is only popular with young adults and Linkedin strictly amongst buisinessmen. Facebook's succes can be explained by the fact, that it was opened a very long time ago and gained lots of followers.
