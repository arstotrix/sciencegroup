The graph illustrates differences among unemployment indexcies in variety of world parts from the sample in the period of 2014 and 2015 years.
It is clear from the chart that such world regions as North Africa and South Asia have equal rates in 2014 and 2015 years. However this figures are much more higher in N. Africa, reaching 12,5. It is the most enormous rate in this sample. On the contrast, Middle East and Latin America characterize with more unemployment people in 2014 than in 2015. Meanwhile EU has another trend that changes the conclusive results of the research. Unemployment rate for 0,4 % is bigger in 2015 than in 2014. As a result, the opposite outcomes of sampleâ€™s constituents influence worldwide index: in 2015 it doubles the index in 2014, wich remains at the level of 5,9%.
Overall, it is not argued, that worldwide rate of unemployment did not changed in researching period because of fluctuating dynamic of each part of the sample. It means that worldwide index does not provide us with truthful information about every region.
