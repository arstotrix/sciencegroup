Governmental spendings have always been a debatable issue, and so are the spendings on space. Many people claim that this money would better be spent on some social issues (such as fight with poverty) or environment problems. Personally, I disagree with this point of view.
To begin with, investing money in space exploration is also investing money in the future itself. Who knows, perhaps we will be forced to leave Earth, and space exploration programs might come in handy in such scenarios. Furthermore, space is all around us, so I suppose we should know a lot of things about it and all the other possible variants for relocation.
Secondly, space exploration may bring us new sources of different resources, or even get us some new materials we have never heard of! Space is immensly big, so there might be something interesting and useful out there, so why not explore it?
On the other hand, those who what governments to stop space exploration programs and spend all that money on other problems can be understood. First, space programs can result in nothing, so they might seem like a waste of money. Second, these programs are really costly, so a lot of money is being pumped into the sphere, without knowing the result, and if the result is not satisying enough, people (whose taxes are the specdings being pumped) may get angry.
Overall, I believe that these space exploration programs should not be stopped. Even though they might seem like a waste of money, it is always good to be ahead of your opponents, and space exploration programs may give such an opportunity.
