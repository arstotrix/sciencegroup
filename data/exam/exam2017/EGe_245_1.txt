The graphs illustrate the difference between average maximum and minimum temperatures in Yakutsk and Pio de Janeiro during the year.

By looking at the graph we can notice that difference between maximum and minimum temperatures in both cities is not dramatic, but pretty noticable at the same time.
The most obvious difference between the climat of this two cities is tha temperature difference between the seasons.
It is easy to observe that climat in Brazil is much softer and comfortable than in Yakutsk, Russia.
The temperature in Rio de Janeiro stayes at point of aproximately 25 degrees the whole year. The highest temperature it has ever reached is 30 degrees in January and the lowest - about 18 degrees in July.
According to the graph we can also make a conclusion that the difference between average maximum amd minimum temperatures in Brazil usually doesn't get wider than 8 degrees.
The highest difference that is shown in graph is about 9 degrees in July.

The second graph illustrates quite obviously, that the climate in Yakutsk is less comfortable and soft.
It is very easy to conclude that the average difference between season temeratures is very dramatic.
The tempreture reaches its' lowest point in January with about -40 degrees.
Then it starts to climb rapidly, increasing by aproximately 15 degrees every month, until it reaches its' pick with 20 degrees in July. The difference between minimum and maximum temperatures is not that obvious during winter season; for example it is only about 5-7 degrees in January and December.
The picture, however, changes in summer, with more that 10 degrees difference in June and July.
To sum up, the difference between maximum amd minimum temperatures stays practicaly the same whole year in Brazil, while it changes dramatically from season to season in Yakutsk.
