The pie chart depicts how different goods were transported in different ways in Eastern Europe in 2008: by rail and by road.
First of all, it is hard not to mention that the most popular poducts that "travelled" by rail were metals. However, it seems that it was not very useful to delliver them by road. We can see that usually companies choose this way of transportation for food products.
Secondly,while we were making a comparison we noticed that these two chart had something in common - the indexes of manufactured goods and chemicals are very alike. So, that means that these products can be easily transported in both ways.
To conclude, it is very important to add that the difference in these pie chart can be easily described if someone will look at them attentively. They show that big quantity of goods that were dellivered by road were very heavy and that is why they were rarely transported by road.
