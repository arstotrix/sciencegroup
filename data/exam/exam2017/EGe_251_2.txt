Nowadays there are too many crimes in our cities and towns, because the life level is really low and economy of our country is not so stability. So, the main question in this problem is how to punish this criminals.
First off all, the way of thinking of many people is like that: criminals must be in prison for a long time. From my point of view, it is a good solution of the problem because these people won't do other bad actions in future. However, I think, that it is not nesseccary to make good conditions in the prison becausee there are people who killed and robed. They are not pay attention to the law, so we need not pay attention to their conditionals.
From the other hand, there is alternative way of punishment: it is reabilitation. People in prison have very good conditionals, for example, clean bath and own toillet, book shelf and tabel, TV and soft bad. This way of reabilitation is good for people who want to change their life. In prison they can work and after a few years they become a normal people. In my opinion, it is a strange way of punishment due to this conditions. It is look like that they are not in prison but they are in theit normal life, where they can walking, working, watching TV and enjoing their life style.
In conclusin, the best way of punishement, I think, is being in prison for a long time. Although, alternative way is exist: it is reabilitation, but it is too "soft" for criminals.
