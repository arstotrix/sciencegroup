It is clear that musicians and film producers become victims of modern easy access technologies. Downloading your favourite film for free or getting a new music album is obviously easy but ab illegal way and leads to a serious problems. 
How can we deal with this problem? I personally think that people who share illegal music and film files are theviers. For example, lets take a look at worldwide news, the company “Pirate bay were serving free films, books, music, nowadays the owner of that company is in jail because of illegal sharing copies. It’s a great example of bad outcome. Firstly, we need to support artists, by buying a film or CD, DVD we support people who do their job and, hence, as a result not supporting, helping crime business to grow. To prevent the work of  lillegal pirate coping some companies started releasing an original CD’s only at the authentical stories and some decided to fight with counterfeit by putting galagraghic sticker in production. The fight with counterfeit is crucial, if there are any ways of cutting-off pirates we need to support it by buing original copies. In Russia we have a planty amount of groups and people who fight with such problems. It is important not to only critisize the pirates but to support the authors by buing real CD’s, investing personal money to author. 
All in all, the whole problem is accute and up to date -, partly because these days in the era of Internet people replace CD’s with mp3’s but frankly speaking, I came to the conclusion that we have to fight with all the pirate counterfeit in the most effective ways as it possible. It may seem an oldie but if you pay for every author job the world will chair.
