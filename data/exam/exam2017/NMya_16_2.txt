Amount of young people, who commites crimes, has rosen in past few years. People concerned with this problem, and we should find reasons, why teenagers commite crimes, and how we can solve this problem.
The first reason of this problem can hide in a childhood. Nowadays parents spend a lot of time at work. This causes lack of time, which parents should give to their childrens. This lack leads us to lack of education about good and evil, and concequences of evil steps. There could be another reason of our problem. Poor families quite often have more than one child. If parents don’t try to educate their children properly before school, children can get in some bands. People from these bands can provide teenagers with money, but they will ask teenagers to do some “dirty job”.
There are a lot of solutions of this problem. First of all, parents should give more attention to their children and spend more time with them. These points can increase trust in future, and parents will be able to understand, with whom their childrens are communicating more. Therefor, government should pay more attention to the poor group of nation, and make thought-provoking propaganda about crimes. These measures will help children to avoid marginal groups of people.
In conclusion, I would like to say, that problem of rising amount of youngsters, who commites a crime, can be solved by parents, teachers and government. The main idea is to give more time and attention to children and their social life.
