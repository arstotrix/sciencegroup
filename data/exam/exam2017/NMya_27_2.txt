It is known that nowadays the young people commit the biggest amount of crimes compare to the previous times. There are some reasons for such awful fact.
First of all, there is a quick development of different kinds of cruel computer games. Using of them lead to cruelty in the minds of teenagers. Some boys become crazy about killing in the virtual world. Unfortunately, some of them bring this passion to the real life. The second reason in my opinion is a wide using of Internet by kids. There are some rude advertisment there which also has some influence on the child's mind. The third one is a lack of control by parents, sisters, brothers and other relatives. In the previous times the system of looking for children was more strict. Now they have access to everything they want because of the Internet also.
Actually, there is no doubt that adults should try to make this situation better. There are some ways how to improve it. I claim that restrictions on teenager's access to the Internet will help a lot. The young people should not be able to watch cruel movies and videos also. The second way to prevent crimes by teenagers is to explain them why the last ones are gruesome. The schools have to add some lessons for that, and invite psychologists in order to speak with pupils about the damage of crimes.
To sum up, the problem of growing amount of crimes making by teenagers is very actual and is a reason for anxiety about their future. The fight with this problem is a duty of every conscious human!
