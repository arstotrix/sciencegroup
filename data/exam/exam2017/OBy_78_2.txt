It is commonly agreed that frequently used new technology increasing variety of heath issues.

First of all lets look at what specificllly health issues we talking about. One of the problems is the rays that are produced by your devices. Sometimes it causing you headache, stress and a lot of attention sometimes focused not on work but on spending time with your device. Also if you spend too much time sitting by the TV or playing games, or working on computer can cause you decreasing your eyes health and even damage them so much that you can lose your focus. For example because for my studying sphere, which is design, I have to work on my computer a lot, and because of that I can barely see what is faraway and when I was younger my eyes could see everything perfectly. So  because of my time spent on the computer today I frequently have a headache, my vision is blurred, I’m always on nerves, can’t barely calm down, sometimes I loosing the words, that I tried to say because I easily loosing my concentrate.

Second lets reconsider the ways of how to reduce the damage. You can’t ignore the damage that caused by modern devices, so we should find a way of first: how to reduce damage; second: how to get tid of damaging health.  So the answer to the questions is simple. The thing that we can’t live without is the thing that we need right now – oxygen. We should spend more time on the fresh air, so it will decrease pit headaches and provide us with calmnesy. And also no matter how cliché it sounds you should meditate for an hour a day, so your eyes can relax and your mind and all your body.

To sum up we can say that problem with health is touched by everyone. Because even our grand mothers even if not using phone, using TV’s and preferred to spent their time indoors, than outdoors, and that’s the problem people should spend more time outside, breathe the fresh air and relax by meditating and also do some yoga to correct your posture if sitting too much with your laptop.
