The information given depicts the average maximun and minimum temperatures in certain towns, namely in Yakutsk in Russia and Rio de Janeiro in Brazil.The data are provided in the amount of degrees Celcies per each month during the year.
It can be deduced from the graph that the average minimum temperature in Rio de Janeiro remained practically unchanged at the temperature of 22 degrees Celcies over zero. Similarly, the maximum temperature was stable throughout the whole period under discussion at approximately 30 degrees Celsies over zero. Thus, the average maximum and minimum temperature there somehow stagnates between 20 and 30 degrees Celcies respectively.
Speaking about Yarkuts, the minimum temperature flactuated at about 40 degrees Celcies below zero, achieving its peak at the temperature of 10 degrees Celcies over zero in July. It demonstrates a five-time increase. While the minimum average temperature there flactuated at the level of 35 degrees Celcies below zero, having the peak at 25 degrees Celcies over zero in July. This illustrates a sixfold rise. So, the average minimum and maximum temperature in Yarkutsk shows the upward trend in the first part of the period and the downward trend in the second, returning to the previous level of temperature.
Overall, summarizing all information provided it can be stated that the average temperatures in Rio de Janeiro are constantly about 20 or 30 degrees celcies over zero during the whole year. At the same time the average temperatures in Yakutsk went down maximum to 35 degrees Celcies below zero, then had the peak at the level of 25 over zero and ,finally, went back to the last temperature. As we can see, the average temperature in Yakutsk is unpredictably high in July, as it is in Rio de Janeiro, and totally little in the rest part of the year.
