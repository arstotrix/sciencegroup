To begin, the problem of modern technology widespread is becoming more and more essential nowadays. It is important to keep in mind that some new technologies may cause many health problems.
Needless to say that new gadgets are being created in order to make our live easier and more convenient. Anyway, some time after realization and using of them, scientists find out that some gadgets may be hazardous to heath. For example, almost everybody has a microwave "oven" in the kitchen. This gadget is extremely useful because helps us to make food hot in a few minutes without odd actions and preparings, but microwaves themselfs may affect badly our hormonal system. The way how to minimize this risk was found. Now manufacturers set special "defenders" around dangerous zones. So, the system is still based on microwaves, but they are unable to cause health problems.
Another example concerns monitors and TV screens. We remember that some time earlier they were big, low-quality and simmering because worked though special beams' emitter. These monitors were hazardous to humans' sight because of permanent simmering. Nowadays we have monitors with liquid crystals, which do not deteriorate the functions of our high organized sight system.
In conclusion, it is worth saying that use of modern technology definetely may cause many health problems, but if consumers and manufacturers are able to reveal them, they are not problems anymore, so as they can be solved.
