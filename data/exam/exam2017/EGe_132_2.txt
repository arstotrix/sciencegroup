The persentage of crimes committed by the young is constantly growing and now crimes are commited by young people more than before. There are some causes of this situation. In this essay I will provide the causes of this developement and suggest my solutions.
Firstly, the main cause of the growing level of crimes committed by young people nowadays is the lack of work places. Young people graduate from university and start searching for job, while they realise that there is no work places for them. This may trigger some criminal events, such as gambling for getting money, working illegaly and even commiting crimes just to survive. I think possible solution for this problem may be for the goverment to create more work places. Hovewer, this may cost a lot of money and take a lot of time. Another solution may be for the goverment to start a program that will help young people to find a job after the graduation without having a real work experience. With the help of this program, the level of crimes will drop.
Secondly, it is clear that a lot of crimes committed by young adults may be caused by alcohol, especially the ones that commited while driving a car. Crimes committed after drinking are happening often and they are a real problem nowadays. The solution for this problem may be restricting driving the car in unsober condition. This can prevent a lot of crimes and fatalties on the road, however, it will require more policemen and it is hard to put into work. Another solution for this problem may be for the goverment to restrict the sales of alcohol, for example, sale it to people who are older than 21 instead of 18, or sale it only from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m..
To conclude, the level of crimes that are being comitted by young people is really high nowadays, and this problem remains unsolved. In my point of view, this problem needs to be tackled as soon as possible.
