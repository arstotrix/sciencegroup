The charts give information about the proportion of white and non-white population in the Uk and in the USA during the 2015.
Generally it is clear from the charts that the percentage of non-white population in the USA was growing more impressively than in the UK. Also that the share of white people fell down in the USA like in the UK.

Looking in details, it may be seen from the first chart that white population outnumbered non-white in the UK during the whole year.Nevertheless it grew nearly 2 times, from 12% to 26%. At the same time the rate of white people slightly fell down from 88% to 74%.
In the second chart we deal with not so dramatically changes in the percen teges of population, except from the rate of non-white population, which was grown dramatically to compare with white population.
Overall it's evident from the charts that the USA is more multicultural country and that in the end of 2015 non-white population was dominated white population.
