The use of illegal drugs in sport is quite a big problem nowadays. A lot of sportsmen try to cheat to become a winner, to be the first and the best. Of course, honest sportsmen that do not use such drugs or doppings cannot show their results they cannot realize themselves. 
So, different sports organizations ban that athletes-cheaters for a limited period. I think this is the right decision. Otherwise, there are some people that think that cheaters should be banned permanently and they should not ever had a chance to continue their sport career. 
In my opinion, if the cheater was caught for the first time, he or she should be banned for a limited period. However, if the cheater was caught for a second time, he or she should be banned forever. I think so because all people make mistakes sometimes. And people can change their views by time, they can understand their previous mistakes and be better than they were. Actually, when we ban cheaters forever, we do not even give him a chance to be better, to think over his mistake. And when we do this it looks like some kind of “sport execution”. However if we will just “punish” for two years and not “execute”, we are able to make a better person. Unfortunately, if the sportsman will fail again, we ban him forever.
I believe that such rules are strict, because not honest sportsmen will be afraid of permanent ban and will not even ask someone about illegal drugs. I also think that there has to be special investigations that will help to find dealers of this kind of drugs. Sport competitions like the Olympic Games should be honest, because the main reason you took part in it is to prove something to yourself and not to others.
