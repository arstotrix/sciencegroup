Nowadays, the principal aim of different social networks is a frequent question to discuss. Some people say that such social media as Facebook and Vkontakte should provide the opportunity to educate people, others believe that the main goal of these sources are communication and entertainment without any information background. In my essay I will look at the both sides of the argument and give my own opinion. First of all it should be noticed that Facebook and Vkontakte were founded originally as a new means of communication through the Internet. In modern society we have no easier to find and cooperate with different people from all the world as these social media provide us. That is the reason why social networks ensures different types of games and entertain content. On the other hand, most global youth spent time searching in such networks. As it has a huge impact on modern society it should be full of various kinds of respect information to develop people’s medias. Furthermore, almost all media resources have their accounts in Vkontakte or Facebook as it is the smallest way to spread their thoughts to people. The twice phenomenon of globalization and communication techiques development have leaded to the fact that internet social media are the most popular way of getting knowledge and information. Personally, I believe that there should be a required proportion of serious and light information provided by social networks for every user, as it depends on an individual’s personals needs and desire.
