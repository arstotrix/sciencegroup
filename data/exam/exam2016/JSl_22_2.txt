What can be clearly seen nowadays is that air travel contributes to air pollution very much and it is important to control this situation. That is why there is an opinion that government should prohibit a part of air travel and such decision can be advantageous. Firstly, it can be productively because nowadays people have been forgetting about other types of transports as buses, trains, boats and if there are laws to reduce the amount of air travel, people will be switching from travelling by air to one by water, roads and the air pollution will be lower. Secondly, these laws can improve the safety people because it is known that there were several accidents in the airports with many deaths. Reducing the amount of air travel can decrease the appearance of people in crowded places. It is an extra advantage of such laws. However, there is the other side of the coin. Buses, cars, trains do real harm to the environment. That is why it is hard to say what it is better: to reduce air travel or to increase water or road travel. Besides, many people can avoid the law and continued travelling in the air and restricting of using planes can be pointless. Furthermore, it is important to prohibit all the flights and it will be a real trouble for governments to invent all the law. To sum up, the problem describe in this essay, is a double edged sward. I consider that government should discuss all pros and cons and then reduce the flights.
