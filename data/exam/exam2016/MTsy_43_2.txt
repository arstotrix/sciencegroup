There is an opinion that air travel is unnecessary, because it contributes to global warming. And some people believe that goverment must reduce the amount of any kind of air travel. I'm partly disagree with this point of view.
First of all, planes are the aspect of climat changes, but it's not the only one reason. We still have cars and industrial manufactures, which also play a role to air pollution. And if we want to stop this catostrophe, we should ,ake a change in all these factors, not only in air travel.
Air travel is the comfortable and, what the most important, sometimes the only way to travel to different coutries. Without airplanes we won't be able to explore the worls as fast and simple as we do it right now. Moreover, planes help businessmen to cross the ocean in couple of hourse and make some decision with company partners faster than it was couple hundreds years ago. Air travel also helps us to go to our families and friends in different countries wherever we want. We don't wait to special plane for hours or even days, we just buy the ticket and go to the airport. Planes are the avaible, comfortable and simple way to do all these things.
To sum up, maybe the air travel is the reason of global warming, but it's something usual in our lives. We can solve the global warming problem without reducing the amount of air travel.
