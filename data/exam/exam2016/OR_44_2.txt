Lets try to find benefits of longer prison sentences. How it will influence on number of most violent crimes? Changing of number of this situations will be near by zero becose by the great majority laws this type of crime means life long prison sentence or execution. Si it is hard and useless to try to find more cruel laws. If prisoner deal mostly harmless crime than after out of jail he have no reason to repeat it becose he know the consequences. Harder laws bring harder mistakes than judgement became wrong like it was in Chikatilaâ€™s situation then absolutlly innocent man was killed instead serial maniac Chikatilo. So I see no way to give longer prison sentences. I think that crime should be canceled before they have been. This is difficult but mos right way to reducing crime rate.
