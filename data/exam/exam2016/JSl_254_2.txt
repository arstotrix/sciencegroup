Today, people use social media every day and its role is considerable. One people think that it is useful only for sharing and getting new information, while others suppose that its main function is entertaing. In my opinion, I will look at both points of view and give my own opinion. It is a well-known fact that we use social media suc has Facebook and Vkontakte to learn something new about the world and our country. For example, every evening I flick through the site Vkontakte to get new information about my native city, its events and watch new photos of it. However, I cannot ignore the fact, that the information in such social media is not always correct and it should be always checked on the other sites. as an example, some articles in Vkontakte and Facebook include numbers that are not quite right. It is so, because everybody can post everything and nobody proof read the information you give. As for another point of view, social media can become an excellent way to relax and spend your time. For instance, there are a lot of amazing videos and films in sites like Vkontakte and Facebook, you can download and enjoy. Nevertheless, it is not the main purpose of social media. To my mind, it is more used for communication and sharing your impressins with friends and relatives who can be far from you. As for me, now I leave in Moscow and all my family stay in Samara. And to maintain our relations we communicate a lot in social media like Vkontakte. All in all, social media is widely used among people of different ages. Ones use it to share information, others prefer to relax and distract from reality with these sites. Personally I think that only the combination of all the functions have made social media so popular.
