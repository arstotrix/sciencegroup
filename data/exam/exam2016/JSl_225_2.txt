Nowadays, air travelling become usual thing such as car driving. Millions of people every day cross the sky sitting in comfortable arm-chairs and eating their food. That became the most protected way of travelling. But there is strong evidence that raising number of flights influence the nature in a bad way. Should we legaly decreased the amount of flights to protect the environment? To my mind, it is absolutely annecessary and to be hones is a big mistake. No government law about number of flight would help the environment. Much bettr idea is developing technologies. The law about development of planes’ fuel and engines will be ten times effective. Government should not faster the people no tot fly, killing the dream of thousand previous years which came true, government should invest money into technologies. First of all, it would enriched our culture. There are e-mobiles now, why there couldn’t be e-planes? After that the flight will be easier and faster and a little bit faster we will travel the space like we travel the countries. People invent airplanes, why we should step back now? It’s unreasonable. We reduce time spending on travels. People got from one point to another for months. In my opinion, we should not turn back cars to the horses. To conclude, air pollution and global warming won’t be a big trouble. There were terrible disasters before human. Planes are not so big trouble like meteorite. The world is changing. We shouldn’t be scary about it. We should develop our technologies, our way of living, ourselves.
