This days air travelling blamed for it’s negative effect on environment, that’s why a lot of people think that governments should make the law against unnecessary and  frequently flights.
To begin, it can be said that air travel is really harmful not only for nature, but also for people’s health. The patrol consumed during the flight go out in the atmosphere as exhausted fumes, wich demaged ozon layer and pollute the oxygen, that we breath. It also spoils the condition of climate and led to global warming and green house effect.
Despite of these facts air travel has a lot of disadvantages. First of all, it saves a great deal of time for people, who moved from one point of the world to another and visited different places. Of course, we can avoid flights if we need to go not very far from own location – in this case train is more suitable kind of transport. But if we have necessety to cross the distance of thousands miles, we can’t do it without opportunity to use planes. To sum up, it is evident that people should pay attention and take care about inhabitant where they exist. But live without  air travelling is uniminaginable. In my opinion, the only way to solve this problem is making a low reducing the number of flights and prohibiting flights for short distance. And I hope that in a little while these measure will improve the nature.
