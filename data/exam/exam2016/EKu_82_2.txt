Nowadays people, living in a difficult world, attempt to come up with different ideas in order to reduce the number of crimal acts so that one could feel safe in society. It is widely believed that longer prison sentences could be the right measure to reduce crime. Still, I would rather agree with the ones who believe that there can be alternative and more effective ways of reducing crime. The first group of people is sure that a longer isolation in prison can be effective for law breakers to become better and help them to start a new life. Most people think that these longer prison sentences mean necessarily hard conditions, which is not always right. There are actually two systems of keeping prisoners isolated that totally differ from each other. The first one, that is called American, implies harsher live and working conditions in prisons. That is the way to punish crimers with a hard work and isolation from the outside world which appears to be really tough considering human psychology. The other system is Scandinavian, which gives a prisoner all the comforts and conditions that are essential and familiar for people in everyday's life. Such prisons have a closed territory on which there are many sports and amusement facilities. Some of them even have music studios. The scandinavian system appears to be that better alternative way that people are searching for nowadays. This kind of a "beneficial" isolation reminds a prisoner that he is still a man and keeps him in such conditions, which seems to me to be the only one right and effective method to reduce crime.Â  To sum up everything, I would like to note that finding an appropriate way of reducing crime remains one of the crucial problems that the society needs to find a solution for. There are both advantages and disadvantages in different methods and systems, still, I believe that the Scandinaxian one, described above, can give people the result that they expect.
