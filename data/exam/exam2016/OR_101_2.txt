There is an opinion that large amount of air travel cause an air pollution and global warming, and it is necessary to limit the number of air travel. In what way it seems to be true and is government regulation really important for soluting the problem? Personally I strongly disagree with the view above. To begin with, nowadays it is a lot of other transport systems, such as cars, buses, ships, etc, so why it is thinked that only air travelling polluted the atmosphere? Furthermore, reducing the air travelling is impossible in modern society, because it will stop the life of million people who use air transport every day. But there are people who declare the fact, that many of earth transport become more and more clear from day to day. They believe, that new cars will be non-dangerouse for our planet and we should refuse air travelling at all. The opinion above sounds good, but science is not create such beautiful safety transport yet, so in my opinion no matter what transport is using by people, it is polluting air in any ways. In addition, once a life I was changed my air travel for travel by car, and it was uncomfortable and taken really much time. To make a conclusion, I would like to say that air pollution and global warming is extremely important problem that must have a solution. But reducing the amount of air travel is not wisdom decision until it will be created and provided a suitable exchange for this type of transport.
