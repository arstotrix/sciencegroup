In the charts on the picture we can see the tendency of investments in renewable energy from 2006 to 2013. The graphs represents us financial statistics on energy resources in developed countries, developing countries and world total amount. I would like to start with information about developed countries. In 2006 the amount of money spent by this type of countries on renewable energy was 75 billions of dollars. Next three years (2007-2009) investments provided for resourses was about 110-100 billions of dollars. But in 2010 we can sea a rapid increase of financial support nearly in 1,5 times, in 2011 almost in 2 times compare to 2009. However, later we see a slow decrease of the money provided for renewable energy. In 2012 developed countries spent 140 billions on energy resourses, in 2013 the amount was 120 billions of dollars. As we can see the amount of spendings of developed countries are different each year. There is no stable financial statistics on the graph. But if talk about developing countries we can see a tendency in the investments in renewable energy. From 2006 to 2012 we can see how investments were growing from 25 billions to 110 billions of dollars. That is a very stable growth of financial investments compare to developed countries. But  in 2013 we can see a small deacrese of money spendings. World total statistics shows us the whole amount of money spend on renewable energy. There is an increase from 100 billions to 279 in 6 years, then a decrease from 279 to 214 billions in three last years. Overall, we can see how developed countries and developing countries spending their investments on renewable energy. Both types of countries have their own tendency of financial spendings.
