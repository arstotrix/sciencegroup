In the modern world there is a tendency to help the developing countries to raise their economical levels, to do some necessary steps in the development in social and cultural sphere. That is why many big companies with the branches in many places of world can afford themselves to move some parts of their businesses to the countries with bad economical results to help them.  This idea has many advantages. Firstly, it is a real help to the poor counties, because their citizens can get a job, can earn money, can improve their level of life and be sure about their financial situation. Secondly, this step makes a big company more popular all over the world, it can gain some respect not only from developed countries but also from the developing ones. Thirdly, in this case more goods will be present in small or poor countries and because of this people there can live better and have wider choice.  Of course, there are some minuses. The process of companies moving leads to the success of the globalization, while the process of globalization has its own pros and cons, in some spheres it can affect the world in a bad way. For example, if a big company moves to the poor country, some local organizations and companies can have a lower level of production and therefore be closed. In this case some people will lose their job and the national business will be affected. To conclude, I can suppose that it is necessary and important to help each other to live better and to develop, that is why big companies should give work and goods to the poorer countries.
