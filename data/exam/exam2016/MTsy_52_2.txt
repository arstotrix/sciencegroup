Nowadays in modern world travelling become more and more popular. Every day millions of people use plane for their business trip or for holidays. Some people say that it is nessecary part of our life others say that it demages our environment and we should try to decrease number of flights.
In my opinion air travel is important for modern society. There is a sertain reason for it. Firstly, every country has it’s cultural identity, it’s tradition. Travelling enables us to meet with it, to make our life brighter with the emotions from foreign countries.
Secondly, a lot of people have relatives in different part of world. Family is very important for everyone. Some ways take too much time and planes are the fastest source of transport. Using air travelling can help people to spend together more time, reducing time in the way.
Moreover, there rare a lot of business duties that can not be done in one country. Society should share experience with other men. Also world trade is a base of the all state’s economics. People should travel for the success of their duty.
To sum up, I would like to say that of course air pollution is a huge reason for the reducing amount of flights, but world business is impossible with out it and it makes a big impact on world economic. Also, family and travelling are need fast ways of transport.
