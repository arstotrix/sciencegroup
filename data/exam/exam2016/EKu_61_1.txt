The graph below demonstrate the changes in Ibvestment in Renewable Energy between thw ages 2006 and 2013. As an owerall trend investment increases from 100 d.Bn to 214. According to the graph developed contries always invest much more money than Developing contries. The overall increasing is not constant. It is slow between the marks 100 and 171, then we can notice a tiny decreasing to the 168. Then the line rapidly boomed up to the level of 279 d.Bn. After that we can see a constant decreasing from the 279 d.Bn to 214 d.Bn. As we have noticed above developed contries are more active in investment renewable energy. There is always a difference between developed and developing contries. It minimizes in the 2009 and 2013 years and consists about 40 d.Bn. Although there is a growth in both types of contries, the difference stays the same. The graph illustrate that in 2011 there is the biggest amount of investment in developed countries. It leveled out about 160 d.Bn, while the developing countries stayed at the 100d.Bn level. In summary we have to say that developed contries have the tendency to invest more money in Renewable Energy in the compare with Developing contries. As an overall trend both types of contryes increases the amount. But during the last years this trend is not underlying anymore.
