According to the information presented in the bar chart, the amount of boys and girls without access to primary school in the period from 2000 to 2012 is almost equal. We can observe, that the amount of childs without education has a trend to decrease by the time goes on. The largest number of childs without access we can find in Africa in te beggining of the current century and the lowest amount in South Asia twelve years later. Talking in numbers, the highest amount of children without access to primary school was recorded in Africa 16 years ago, where it hitted 43.7 millions. On the other hand, the lowest level was recorded on the mark of 10 millions in South Asia, 4 years ago. In order to summarise the information, it is fair to say, that according to the presented bar chart we can clearly see that the amount of boys and girls without access to primary school is decreasing through out the years and we may predict that according to this trend this number will be drammaticaly low in few years.
