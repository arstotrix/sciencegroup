Environmental problems are the most essential for humanity, because all will suffer from them, regardless gender or social status. It is hardly surprising, that authorities try to do their best in solving these problems. It strikes me, that if the pollution can be reduced, people should use all opportunities to do it. Due to the fact that some air travel can be replaced by other transport, they should be banned. Nowadays modern cities are powerhouses of different meanes of transport, that is why there are a lot of opportunities to refuse from air travelling. For example, there is special train between Saint-Petersburg and Moscow that can cope with this way for 4 hours. Obviously, it will be faster to do it by a plane, but this train is an ecological-friendly one. Moreover, it is known that going somewhere by plane is really dangerous way of travelling. Recent air disasters prove that. Becides the use of this transport is very expensive. In comparison with trains, only rich people can afford it. At the same time, taking lot of time, travelling by a train is a great possibility to relax and to enjoy stanning views instead of the same picture while going by a plane. To sum up, if people can save this planet without big loss, they should do it, because the upshort of this comfortable and quick trips can be very sad for the environment. Of cause, there are some situations when planes can not be prohibited, when it is a question of human lives. Despite this fact, there are a lot of other cases, when air tripes can and should be baned, for instance, for leisure. If people refuse from them, whey will loose something, but they will solve environmental problem.
