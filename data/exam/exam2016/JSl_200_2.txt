Many people think that best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others believe that there are better, alternative ways of reducing crime. In my opinion, everybody can become a criminal, because there are too many reasons, that people go on crime. It can be psychology illness, very poor life or bad company, where offender grew up. In my opinion, if you want stop crime you have to fight with reasons of it, not symptoms. For example, tell more and better to children about good and bad things. It’s not so hard work, but it’s very important, this mission have to perform parents and social together. Also if you want to beat a crime you have to make higher the level of life in your country, make it so good that people don’t need to go on extremely hard job for incredibly low money and have to go an bad criminal road of life. It’s the first problem of governments, let’s look to Canada, Finland, the level of the life in this countries very good, and, as a rule, crime is unbelievably low. And look to Afghanistan and Pakistan, people have to leave their countries because there are no any pretty good job, there are too many ways, crime, and every day they have a revolution of the new government. So, stopping a crime is a long and hard work, but if we can do it everywhere, in every countries, our world will be pretty and wonderful!
