The graph below suggest to us information about the changes of school assessment. There are some charasteristics that can help us to evaluate the problem. There are gender and location.
Nowadays, there are a lot of countries where children can’t study at school. The  example, ar Africa 43.7 million children didn’t have the opportunity to study in 2000. But this issue has not only location reasons, it has gender reasons too. For instance, in South Asia 11.1 million boys und 21.6 girles in 2000 have no access to primary education. And many researches ask the question: “Who will be this children?”. As for scientists’ opinions, they will become crimers, alcoholics and murders. Nevertheless to this sad tendention, we can see that in South Asia this social issue will disappear soon. In 2012 there were only 5.1 million boys and 4.8 girls without the opportunity to study in Primary School. But the location play an important role. As graph shows, in Africa this problem is solving slowly. Comparing 2000 and 2012, we can see that proportions came down only for 11%. The reason is bad and poor conditions of Africa region. Rest of World have better conditions, they have 23.3 at 2000 and 15.3 at 2012.
In conclusion, I want to say that children should go to school in all cases. Education helps children to know this difficult world. And in my opinion, kids shouldn’t be hurted by governments mistakes.
