This chart illustrates us data about investments in renewable energy in the whole world. However, we can see that this spendings are different in two types of countries and their trends are distributed differently from 2006 year to 2013. Overall, as can be seen on bar charts, there are different investments on renewable energy by country type, but actually they have one trend. This spendings on energy in developed countries remained stable in the period of 3 years since 2006, but then investments on energy extremely rised up in 2011 year and took position approximately 175Bn. But then this chart illustrates that spendings started slightly fall down and decreased on 50$ bn for two next years. We can compare spndings on renewable energy of developing countries with developed and as a result we can see next outcome: investment in developing countries are smaller than in developed and this differentiation fluctuated from 75$ bn (the maximum shift between countries) to appr.30 $ bn (in 2009 and 2013 years). If we take a look on World total trend on investments in renewable energy, we can see that it reached a peak of 279$ bn in 2011 year, before its steadily rise in 2006-2009 years, which extremely rised up in next two years. (difference between first observations and maximum is 179$ bn) and this investments became higher more than a half from starting point. But from 2011 year to 2013 thus trend fell on 60 $ bn.
