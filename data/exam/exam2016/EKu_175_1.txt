The charts illustrate changes in the use of Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and provide information about the main reasons for using it among men and women. From the first glance it is obvious, that there are far more people who use desktop version of Facebook, rather than those who use mobile version or mobile application. However, since March 2012 by March 2013 the number of people using the desktop version had decreased from the rate of 150 millions to 135 millions of users. At the same time, there had become more users of mobile version with the rates of 55 and 95 millions of users in March 2012 and in March 2013 relatively. And while in March 2012 there were almost three times less users of mobile version, the difference in numbers in March 2013 was not as significant -- 135 millions of users of desktop version and 95 millions of users of mobile version. As for the main reasons for using Facebook among men and women, sharing photos and videos appears to be the reason for using Facebook among women much more often, than among men: only 39% of men found it imortant while there were 54% of women who considered it to be the main reason to use the social network. Second popular reason was receiving updates, with the rates of 39% of both men and women. 43% of women believe that seeing funny posts is also one of the main reasons and 35% of them also think that learning about ways to help others is also important, but there are approximately 10% of men less who agree with it. To conclude, there are certainly many different reasons to use such social network as Facebook, and the charts show that overall number of Facebook users is still at high rates proving its popularity, whatever version the user prefers -- desktop or mobile.
