People have been discussing the problem of air pollution since time immemorial. Today we still have this problem and it becomes more and more topical in our modern life. Is it true that air travel can become a factor which will creat air pollution and global warming? In my opinion, air travel is unceparatable part of modern people’s life. First of all, every transports have a harmful effects on environment due to this fact people cant avoid all ways of travelling. What is more, there are a lot of people who work in foreign countries and air travel is only way to reache their workplace. Consequently, it will be very difficult to reduce the amount of air travel for business. Secondly, scientist try to creat some new substance which will dicrease harmful effect, such as environmental freandly oil or gas. Finally, there are a lot of laws which regulate this sphere, for example, air code but in practice laws do not create contribution payments system. On the other hand, some people claim that a lot of air travel is unnecessary. They say that people should use transport which work on solar power. Besides, they think that law system which regulate air travelling is very weak, due to this fact government should creat new framework. I strongly disagree with this view, because only air transport allows to travel on a long distances. Air travel are more comfortable and conveniant than cars or trains. Despite other people’s opinion, I still believe that air travel has not proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming.
