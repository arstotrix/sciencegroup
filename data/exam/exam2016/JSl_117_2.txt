Today we live in the conditions of globalization and many corporation wide spreaded all over the world, including third world countries. Sometimes they open daughter â€“ companies in poor countries. In my whole opinion, it has positive effect rather than negative for several reasons. Firstly, employing local workers in international companies may be beneficial either for them and for corporations too. Usually poor countries have the top levels of unemployment rates because of the lack of work places. Employing locals to international corporations may solve this problem. A lot of people who suffer from being without work and money will have a  chance of change their lives. Secondly, moving companies to poorer countries may help them to develop. Opening corporation in Kenya, for example, will led to investments to this area. Such countries in Africa have a lot of natural resources which are not used in poorer and beneficial way. Developing third world countries will reduce a difference between countries all over the world. But on the other hand, there can be some problems too. Investments to developing countries may encourage people to move here and create a disbalance between average human resources. Moreover, if company have some problems and become a bankrupt, local workers will have no alternative ways to employ to another work. All in all, in this situation advantages overweigh disadvantages.
