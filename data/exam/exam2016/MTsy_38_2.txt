In recent years it has proven that air travel is dangerous for the atmosphere and was recognised that many air travels were not necessary. Then government had an idea to introduce new laws in order to reduce this kind of travelling for some activities.
In my opinion, I mostly agree with this point of view, which based on decreasing of the amount of air travel. First of all, the reason is pollution, which contribute to global warming. Environmentalists are convinced that air travel is really damaging to our nature. Aircraft engins emit heat, particularities and gases, which have negative influence on atmosphere and only government can protect the planet from global warming. Secondly, there are a lot of alternative transport exists and they can be less dangerous for human being. Government in this situations should introduce laws, which grab peopleâ€™s attention to the another type of transport. Moreover, unnecessary air travelling, which includes short trips on airplanes for 2-4 hous, should be restricted or banned, because it is possible to use more ecological train, for example.
On the another hand, we are living in a high speed society and time makes money. In different circumstances it is impossible to travel long destinations for a long time. In addition, businessman can not waste their time on trains. In this case air travel should not be restricted.
In conclusion, air pollution must be restricted because of damaging influence on our nature and government should take care of it and introduce some measures like higher taxes or restrictions on short distanse air travel for leisure, but laws can not covered or include businessman.
