Nowadays, society like to think that strict and long prison sentences are the best method of reducing robberies and other types of crime. However, some people think there are some different ways of reducing crime. First, there are less thiefs and buglars in the streats the level of crime falls down. However, when the person accustomed to living in prison for too long it is extremely hard t adopt again. Others claim that if the laws are not strict enough a person will easily makes a thick if he knows no hard punishment will be given. It is certainly true, however not only laws should help the streets be safe at night. Better level of education and infrastructure of cities should benefit the society. In my opinion, we should spend more time on education and on helping people to find work. I am totally think that if a person gets enough for sofisticating living, his is never become a buglar. In addition, in own society if you experienced enogh and well educated and a bit ambitious you should find your dream job easily. However, these is no country that can achieve that goal. That’s why I believe that government should revive an interest of knowledge at youngest age as it is possible because if a person likes studing he will study and will not be connected with crime certainly. In conclusion, we should have strict laws, however the sophisticated level of knowledge and places wher people could express themselves seemed to me more important. Society also should help more to make an exprisoner’s adoption easier. If the society could achieve these goals our countries will be safe than they are now.
