Currently, the ecological problem are the most pressing issues. Not only do airplanes contaminate the atmosphere but it also do effect the development of global warming. That is why, an authorities should impose the rules that will cut the number of travelling by air for business and relational purposes. I partly agree with this statement, because the mankind should concern about ecology to provide a good lives for future generations.
To begin with. Introdused laws can bring a lot of benefits to the environment. The number of emissions will reduce due to cutting of air travel. Moreover, these changes can help to stop the development of global warming. There is no doubt that all travelings by the planes deteriorate the ozon layer. The imposing of limit on it can be a good solution for this situation. A high temperature from the exploded gases may be redused  by this policy. In this connecting problem of global warming can be partly solved. 
However, in the modern age air travel is one of the most safe and convenient means of transport. It helps to conduct a business in all parts of the world. Limit of such travelling can impact on the economic development because a lot of conferences and deal will be canceled. What is more people can not to relax in the foreign countries often since the policy will be acceptable. 
In conclusion it is necessary to say that this problem can have positive effects on the ecological situation. But, it can lead to limit of opportinities in economic and domestic sphere. I personally consider that this uestion requires an accurate consideration before imposing these laws. It can solve the issue of global warming and air pollution that is really crucial for ecological situation.
