It is known that air travel is one of the causes of air pollution and even global warming. Some people argue that part of flights for business and leisure is unnecessary, so governments should think about new laws to decrease the number of them. However, I suppose that this will harm society.

All of us are sometimes using planes as the mean of transport because it is easy, quick and comfortable way of travelling even on long distances. Air travel made our lifes easier as we don’t need to spend months or even year to get from one place to another as it was centuries ago. Also we have opportunities to visit places that were untouched before. The costs of plane ticket are rather small so almost everybody can afford it. So if governments decide to cut down the number of flights, the cost of air travel will rise up rapidly and this will cause unability of some group of people to afford it. This may be harmful for their business if they have to travel often or if their family lives in the other part of the world. Moreover, it may affect pilots as a lot of them will be fired if the number of flights and air companies don’t need so much work force.

On the other hand, the reduce of amount of the air travel may help to solve problems with air pollution and prevent future global warming as less planes will flight. However, I believe that this wouldn't make dramatic change in the problem of pollution as there are a lot of other things that harm our planet.

In conclusion I'd like to say that cutting down the amount of flights by introducing new laws may affect the air pollution but not greatly, while life of people may become uncomfortable and a lot of them will loose their job.
