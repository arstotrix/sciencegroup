Many people say that states have to contribute to reduction of the number of air travel because of its harm influence on air. On the one hand, it is rather difficult to decrease the amount of flights because it is the fastest way of travelling. Most of the companies have to send their workers at another place by plane. For example, it is impossible to imagine how a serious businessman travels for a lot of days by train in the situation when he should join the important treaties as soon as possible. Moreover, a lot of people have no time for travelling by car or by train in another country, because the length of their vacancies is just about two weeks. On the other hand, the issues of air pollution and global warming are becoming essential nowadays. For instance, the ice is melting in Alaska, so people there already have to start searching for a place to live. A lot of factors influence our air: refrigerators in our houses, conditioners, industrial manufactures, cars, smoking and so on. That is why we should reduce the amount of them when it appears possible. Personally, I think it would be difficult for governments to invent laws reducing the number of air travel because a lot of people need it every day both for business and leisure. To sum up, it is extremely important to take care of the state of our air but it seems to be almost impossible to cut the amount of flights.
