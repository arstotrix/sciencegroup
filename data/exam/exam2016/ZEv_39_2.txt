According the fact, that air travels pollute enveirement and increase the risk of global warming, some people believe that goverments should limit the amount of business and leisure air travel. In my mind, it is useless try to reduce the amount of such types of air travel.

For many types of businesses it is vital to communicate with partners. For example, some companies need to communicate with others, firms on TOP management level in order to solve business usiues. Some argue that businesses should using online systems like skype to negotiate and communicate with partners and citizens. But, in many cases, it is not convinient way to reach the consensus.

Limiting amount of air travel for leisure by introducing laws could become a reason of huge using other types of transportations, which also contribute to air pollution. The waste of CO2 in atmosphere by car has a negative impact on environment conditions. It can help to reduce air pollution by air travel but only in short run perspective. In future people continue to travel for leisure using cars, ships and ets.

To sum it up, in my mind trying to limit or introducing laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure are useless. Government should focus on new types of alternative energy resources, and invest money in new technologies.
