At present there is a trend of air travel, that contributes to air pollution and global warming. But the most interesting thing is that many of air travel is unnecessary, thatâ€™s why a lot of people think that governments should reduce the quantity of air travel by laws. I completely agree with the statement, and my essay will be about benefits of this solution to the problem.
First and foremost, there are a lot of other different way of travel: by bus, by train, by car. Everyone chooses his/her favourite one. Moreover, these kinds of transport has not been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. Despite the fact that they are slower than plains, I think that nobody wants to breathe by dirty air contributing by air transport.
The second advantage of introducing laws to reduce the amount of air travel is that, in my opinion, people will be able to enjoy picturesque landscapes and take much more photoes travelling by train or by car. They will be able to spend more time with their famalies, comunicating with the relatives during the trip. It will also be easy for travellers to broaden their horizons with the help of comunication with people from other towns, cities and even countries.
The third benefit of this solution, to my mind, is that people will be able to spend less on tickets to go to another place. It is not a secret that tickets on air travel are more expensive than, for example, tickets on train.
In the conclusion I would like to say that if governments take the law, it will be a reason of many advantages not only for environment, but also for people.
