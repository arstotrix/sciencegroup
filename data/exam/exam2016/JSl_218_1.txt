The given graph provide us information about differences of number of children that had not access to primary school between 2000 and 2012 years. The data show us rate by gender and y regions. First of all, we can see that the number of children without access to primary school in Africa (44 mln) and in South Asia (33 mln) was much higher than in the rest of world (23 millions of children). Then in 2012 the situation became better in all regions â€“ the number of children without access to primary school became less. In Africa the number of children felt down from 44 to 33 million in South Asia from 33 to 10, in the rest of world from 23 to 15,5 millions. Also we can see that proportion between boys and girls during all periods and in all regions was approximately equal, except of South Asia in 2000, where the number of girls were much higher than the number of boys (21,6 millions of girls and 11,1 millions of boys). Overall, we can say that Africa in 2012 year had the highest number of children without access to primary school, South Asia had the lowest number. And the number of children in South Asia changed dramatically, and became lower than in rest of world in 2012 year.
