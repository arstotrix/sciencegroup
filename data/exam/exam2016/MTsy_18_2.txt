Recently the world is facing the problem of global air pollution and global warming. One of the reasons of these is air travel. Some people suggest that the solution lays in reducing of the amount of unnecessary flights, such as business and leisure.
On the one hand, air travel is the fastest way to travel. Millions of people all over the world use airlines every day. The decrease of flights might affect the pace of life and cause some disagreements between common people and governments. One more negative affect of banning some flight is that other ways of travel are less safe. Even though many people are afraid of flights, it is proved that airlines is the safest kind of transport.
In my opinion there is another solution of this problem. Government should introduce laws about extra taxes which would go to cleaning systems. The price will increase for sure, but that’s the only possible way of reducing air pollution without affecting people’s needs I see.
