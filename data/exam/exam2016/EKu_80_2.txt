Nowadays the possible ways to reduce crime are widely discussed. One of the solutions suggested is to keep criminals in prisons for longer periods than now. In my opinion, however, this would not help much and some other measures should be taken.  On the one hand, the idea of giving longer prison sentences seems to be reasonable. First of all, people would be more frightened of punishment, since they would know that they might spend nearly the whole life in prison for the crime. Further, some of the criminals do not change in prison and might bring new troubles to the society after the end of the period spent in prison. It could be also suggested, that if such opportunities would be provided they might study and work in prison and gradually change their views.  On the other hand, this solution is arguable and to me personally does not seem to be very convincing. It should be stressed, that this idea is not humanistic, as long prison sentences do not give the criminals tha chance to start new life after the end of the sentence. Next, as the reserchers show, in some countries where the sentences were rather long the crime rate did not change significantly. Finally, from my point of view, such measures would make people in general much more depressed, as Christianity, for example, learns us to forgive, and many people are religious nowadays.  To sum up, after discussing both these views, it could be said that such measures seem to be too radical and may shock the society. In my opinion, what should be done instead, are the attempts to raise the level of education, of life in general, to make it more comfortable to live in big cities and to encourage people to communicate more not only with their relatives or friends, but also with other citizens. I would also like to suggest to raise the public awareness of the problem of the high crime level, as alternative ways to improve the situation may be found.
