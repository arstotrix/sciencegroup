There are huge amount of ecological problems in the modern world. The main reason of this situation is the people actions: cars, plants, which produce a lot of polution, and airports, air travel. Government can reduce air pollution by reducing the amount of air travel. However, I can partly agree with this point of view and think that there are both disadvantages and benefits of such government politics. First of all, different restriction can reduce the amount of business and leisure travel. As a result, people can get cleaner air, less noise, which is harmful for humanâ€™s health. Consequently, such measures can decrease level of air pollution, global warming and improve such business as higher taxing for the government and increasing level of health. However, reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure can lead to the significant increase in the using of cars, trains and other transport which can be as harmful for the environment and air as the air transport. As a result, such measures can even worse the global environment. To conclude, there are some concerns about reducing the amount of  unnecessary air travel, because it lead to the increasing air pollution in  long-run. That is why I can only partly with such measures as government interventions.
