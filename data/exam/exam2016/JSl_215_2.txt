The amount of air travels have been growing steadily for about 6 past decades. Some researches have proved that this type of transport is responsible for a big share of air pollution and, consequently, global warming , and so their number should be reduced by governments. From my point of view, this statement is only partly truth, as air travel is one of the most convenient and fastest mean of transport. To begin with, planes made our lives law simplier. Nowadays people can get to then destination point on another continent in a few hours, and it, costs nearly the same as travel firstly on train and then on ship , which would take ages to compare with even trips on a short distances could afford almost energy person in developed countries. It helps people to go sight seeing or to visit their friends or relatives move often. In addition, not only planes are harmful to ecology. Most of the trains cars, ships are polluting atmosphere as well, so switching to this ways of travelling will solve the problem. However, there are some reason in the argued sentence. Extremely wealthy people often prefer to travel on private jets, and it surely could be called an unnecessary luxury, which is at the same time damaging Earthâ€™s environment. There are also flights, where less then halt of tickets were bought and this is the the cases, which should be controlled. Probably government should introduce some taxes on that kinds of flight. Furthermore, trains on magnets can be better solution for short distances. To sum up, whether government should restrict flights and how it should be done is quite wide and weep question with requires a lot of consideration of public and experts in future.
