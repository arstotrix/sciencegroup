It is a wide-spread opinion that increase of prison sentences length may strongly improve the criminal situation. But not all people think so. In one view, it is quite logical that longer prison sentences will reduce crime, because more criminals will be in jails so less number of offends will occur. However the history shows a lot of examples of decrease of harmfulness of punishments for criminals. For instance, morality execution is forbidden in all developed countries in contrast to the situation in nineteenths sentury. On the other hand, criminals will do as harsh deals to not  be punished for law breaking as serious punishment. They will get otherwise. Thus, for example, thiefs more likely to kill random citizens who noticed their offends with longer prison sentences. This is very serious and many people that it is th main point in considered dispute. Another important point is the presence of innocent people who was judged because of a court mistake. The prison sentences length increase will make their lives dramatically worse, exactly in slight law break cases. As for me, the disadvantages of suggested method of crime reduction overweigh its advantages. I think that there are a lot of efficient and less bloody methods such alteration of primary school education. In my opinion, it will be supplemented with some law and citizen rights courses. These classes will help to make children understanding the society laws and reasons to not break them. To conclude, I am hardly disagree with the statement that longer prison sentences will reduce crime well.
