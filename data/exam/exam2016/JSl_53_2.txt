Nowadays travelling by the air is widespread, and so it affects the ecology a lot. There is an opinion that the number of flights should be reduced to prevent environment from pollution. I believe that people should care of this pollution, but not by prohibition of flights, but due to technological progress. The airplanes are very common mean of transport and they are important for business, as there are a lot of places, where people can reach only by the air, e.g. oil deposits in the Syberyia, so, governmnets can just prohibit buseness flights, as some urgen question need immediate considerations, and in such cases businessmen extremely need airplanes. So, it can be said, that such laws will surely cause problems for economy. What about flights for leisure, if government will try to prohibit them, it will face with a problem of identifying the purpose of flight. As people who can afford private jets are usually very affluent and busy, they can say that their flight is on current business affairs, and governments will have to devote a plenty of resources to control this issue and decide whether to prohibit the flight or not. The problem can be solved by reducing taxes for aircompanies and business men who use ecological jets. New models of planes, such as Boeing 787, or Airbus 850 are constructed with the main idea of keeping the environment clean, thee planes almost do not pollute atmosphere, they are very ecological, and if more airlines will use them, there will be no danger for our planet form air transport. Low taxes for companies flying on such jets will faster demand for them and only such planes will be designed and produced in near future. In conclusion, the problem of global warming from pollution is real and people do have to cope with it, but not by imposing such measures as they would not bring any benefits to industry and human society for whom the air travel is very important.
