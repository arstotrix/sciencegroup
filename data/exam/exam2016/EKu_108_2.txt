Nowadays there is an opinion that the most efficient way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Anyway there is an argue on this topic, so there are people who believe in other alternative ways of reducing crime which are better in their opinion. The first group of people arguing on this topic, think that all those who commit crimes should get their corresponding prison sentence. If the crime is hard, the person must get the longest prison sentence, otherwise after leaving the prison this person will be able to make the crime once again. So the prison sentence should be as long as the crime maker deserves or he will not understand the extent in which he was wrong. Increasing the prison sentence will reduce the number of people who are able to make some kind of crime, because they would not like to be given such a long prison sentence. So people who know what is expected to them will think before committing crime. Nevertheless there are people who believe in existence of other ways of reducing crime that can be more liberal for person that have committed a crime. For example one of these ways can be a work of a psycologist with a person who was wrong in his actions. So if person do not understand that his action is bad and wrongit, the psycologist will explain it.  In my opinion the first group of people is right, so I think the longer prison sentence will reduce crime, but not any alternative and liberal ways. People who commit crimes are abnormal, their psychics is not the same as normal people's. So any alternative way of reducing crime will not be as efficient, as heavy one for the person which is able to commit a crime.    .
