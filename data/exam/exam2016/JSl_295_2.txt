Nowadays social networks are becoming more and more popular. Some people use them only for listening to music, playing flask games and chatting with friends all night long. From my point of view, there is another important function of these media and in my essay I will support this idea with examples. First, Facebook and Vkontakte contain several web groups where schoolers and students can find useful files and videos for education. Practically every university has an official group in media which is usually employed not only for announcement of events, but also for uploading tutorials and lectures made by professors of this university. The Higher School of Economics, as an example, has an Internet project  “Open leactures” based on Vkontakte. Another important function could be an opportunity for groups of intuests and tastes. In such platforms people can share relevant information on particular subject and do projects involving other members of group. For instance, there are numerous of political groups where members of a political parties and covrlans con communicate and discuss current issues. On other hands, social networks are a global chance to find people with the same view point and collaboratw with them. On the other hand, the influence of Facebook and Vkontakte is designed exactrly for entertainment. They are great media platforms there you can listen to music, watch films, play games and even read books. As an example, when Russian government imposed new form against playraning and the most fact of films and music disappeared from these social networks, the huge of them rapidly dived. All things concluded, social media can be used both for enjoying in the free time and learning new things. Personally, I believe that there websites are an attractive educational fact.
