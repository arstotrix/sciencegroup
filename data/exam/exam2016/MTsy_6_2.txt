I strongly disagree with statement that «as a lot of air travel is unnecessary, so government should ban air travel for business and leisure», because it can influence on our lives, our works and our weekends.
The first point I would like to touch upon is the fact, that many people use air travel in order to rexal more, or work more; because mostly of us want to save their time. Some people air journey for work, and airplanes help to go more faster, than train. I think, that it is better to scientist make less bad oil for airplanes, in order to not contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. Government should not introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel.
On the other hand, many people think that it is very important to protect our planet. Of course, they are right. Decrease the amount of air travel for business and leasure alow us to safe Earth. Governments and introducing laws can help in it. Many people travel very often. Airplannes fly very often, so our air maked more bad and dark, but we can help each other in order to live with fresh air.
In conclusion I want to say that it is important - to protect planet on which we live, and it is possible to reduce the amount air travel for business and leasure. But 	I think that there is no need to ban it and decrease the amount of flying, because it is convenient for people and it makes our travels simply.
