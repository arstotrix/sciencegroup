Crime is one of the biggest problems in our society. We should always try to reduce its level over and over. Many people think that the best ways to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences others believe that there are better, alternative ways of reducing crime. We will discuss about views and try to give our opinion about this problem. There is number of problems in giving longer prison sentences. Firstly, more prisons should be built, because number of prisoners will increase. Consequently, government will spend more money for them, because criminalists have to eat too and more staff to serve the will be needed. Secondly, many criminalists think that they will never be caught. So they will not to stop break the law just because of more serious punishment. I think that first of all country should solve problems in its government system. In our country many people in this system are corrupted and the biggest drug and weapon dealers will never be locked in prison because they have enough money to give it to right people in this system.  I am not expert in this field, but in my opinion should beer cottuption and we can see that it happens, but happens slightly. And we can help our country being honest with law. Summing it up, crime will be always exist and always there will be people, who breaks the law. However, this problem must be always discussed and we have to always try to reduce its level.
