One of the highly argued topics today is whether poorer countries are better for the international companies to locate there their business there or not. This essay is going to cover some advantages and disadvantages of this idea. One of the greatest advantages is the cost of labor in poor and developing countries. It is rather difficult to find proper job in such countries and people there are usually not as highly educated as people in developed ones. Also the standards and prices of living in poorer countries are lower. So, having all this concerned international companies do not have to pay too much for the work done by these people. This strategy can also broaden the market of this company as people living in the county where the product is being produced would likely buy it. As for disadvantages, lower level of education means lower quality of the work done. If people have no knowledge of how to do some kind of work, they need quite a lot of time to learn how to do it and still it does not prove that they would learn how to do it properly. And as lower quality of the product means losses in sales it can be dramatic for the company to locate their business in a developing country. Also, locating their production in another country international companies risk the secrets of their product to be mastered or sold out by a factory in that developing country. So, trying to benefit from such strategy company may ruin completely.  Â  All in all, general statistics show that many greatest figures on an international market have not yet suffered from locating their producing factories in developing but not the poorest countries with great amount of population.
