Nowadays air travelling become more and more popular nowadays, but unfortunately, it remains some ecological problems. The government should pay a lot of attention for reducing the number of travels to solve vitae problems, that have a great impact on our lines. First of all, the developing of air travelling influences our lifes. For instance, in big cities with developed infrastructure there are a growing number of airports, so people living in some regions re suffered from a lot of noises. Moreover, the level of the health of people depends on the quality of air that they breath, so air pollution entails to growing number of deseases, that is also need to spend a lot of money from the government budget. In addition , if the governments will restrict the number of air travel, it becomes a good stimule for the national scientists to invent a way of more ecological way of air tavelling, so it may lead to the higher technical progress. On the other hand, if the way of travelling abroad will be restricted, our country canâ€™t get technologies and inventions from developed countries. Moreover, it will be huge problem for people who have an intentional business. However, problems may be solved by developing, for example ways of getting new technologies via the internet or other interactive ways. Moreover, if the international businessmen will concentrate all their efforts inside our country our nation become much more independent and developed. In conclusion, I should say that not only the government can stop growing global processes but every person should restrict his own pollution by, for instance, air travelling reduction.
