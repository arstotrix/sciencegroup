There was a significant decline in accessibility to primary schools in Africa from 2000 to 2012, composing over 30 mln in 2012 against just more than 40 mln. The Rest of the World also experienced a decrease in the considered rate, approximately 8mln less in 2012 than 12 years ago. However, South Asia was predominantly subjected to changes. The number of children who had no access to primary schools in this region reduced more than twice, from over twenty mln to just under ten mln.
