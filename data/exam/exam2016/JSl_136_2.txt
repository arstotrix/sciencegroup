Obviously, big international companies are developing very fast nowadays. Such organizations build their businesses in developing countries. From my point of view, such development has more benefits than people can imagine. First of all, the process of moving international companies to poor countries helps such countries to develop faster. That is the key reason, why this process is beneficial. Such companies have a great amount of work places for local workers so they can find a suitable job there and earn a lot of money.  Secondly, working in these companies will educate local workers being them experience and great knowledge, so that they can move to our country and find a job, which will be well-paid. The point is that in our local companies there will be more work places for local workers and more work places for foreign educated and professional workers. Besides, such companies will be able to develope relationship between  developed and developing countries, which can change the world to the better. I believe, that people all over the world see the difference between developed and developing countries and we can not let the situation stay the same. If we have a chance we need to use it. Moving big companies to poor countries the next step of their development. Some people claim that this change can be harmful for developed countries, but I am quite certain that there are more benefits in this development than disadvantages.
