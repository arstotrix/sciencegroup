Airplanes may be cause of air pollution and global warming. Quantity of air travel should adjusted by government in order to support environment. But, in fact world do nothing for protect our Earth.
In my opinion, for the last 200 years we passed throw the moment where we have been destroying our planet everyday. We have a lot of wars, we came from agriculture type to manufacturing, moreover no one countries don’t think globally for big aim of safe our Earth, espescially in long term. We continue to build up new factories, manufactures, develop new army vehicle, also airplanes. Even in nowadays, we don’t use separate rubbish, don’t moves by bycicles, don’t use social transport, we just buy new cars and poor petrol inside.
On the other side, we may notice that some commercial enterprises, like Tesla or Space X, who work on supporting our Earth, with help of electrocars and shuttles, which not damage air and atmosphere. Also, such project like 'tube', which will use magnet tube for movements be westside in U.S. without pollution.
Nevertheless, World has some examples, that government are thinking about pollution. Some countries try to come from usuall resources to alternative. For instance, Denmark use energy of wind almost for whole country. Iceland use power of waves and use it in 50%. 
All this arguments lead to air travel not a main problem. We must look on problem with a highest point. Whole world must change. Even if air travel is a part of main aim, indeed we could change with another actions to protect Earth. Today, we use patrol for cars in 95% of cases. Although, could use an electricity.
