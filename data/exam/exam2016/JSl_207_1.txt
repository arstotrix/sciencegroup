Facebook among men and women. As we can see, there are some striking differences in both of the charts throught the given period. As we can see from the first chart, the number of users who browsed Facebook via desktop in 2012 was at the highest level, accounting about 150 million of people, while the number of those who connected to Facebook via mobile devices accounted only a third of the former number. In 2013 there was a slight decrease in the number of desktop users and a sharp increase among those using mobile gadgets. The second bar chart reveals that main reason for women for using Facebook is sharing photos or videos, while there is no a leader among men. Receiving updates and sharing  photos follow the same pattern for the male gender group, accounting 29%. It can be seen that learning about ways to help others is the least popular reason for both of gender groups. Seeing photos is more popular among female group than among the male one, taking 43% for the forms and 25% for the latter. Overall, we can assume that the main trend for the first chart was increasing  of mobile users and decreasing desktop ones, while for the second diagram there were no same spotlight patterns relevant among all of the main reasons.
