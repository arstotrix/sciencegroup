Nowadays people have a lot of problem with ecology. Some way to destroy environment is air pollution and global warming by plans. There are two sides of this problem. Some people think that governments should have a laws which help to reduce the number of air travel for spending free times and business. Of course it makes amount of pollution, because plans use oil and gas to flying. It polluts the atmosphere and increase the temperature in the Earth. A lot of air travel is unnecessary as there are more ecological way, for instance, train, boats and others. If governments can reduce this air travel, they can reduce air pollution. On the other hand, everybody can choose the way of travelling and removing. What is why governments should not to introduce laws to reduce some air travel. Almost main laws in countries say that everybody in this country is freedom and government cannot to influence in peopleâ€™s choice. Every new laws must support the main laws of countries. In conclusion, government should find the trade-off between two points of view. Government should support every people in their country. In my opinion, government should put the tax on oil and gas and other resources which destroy our planet but should not reduce the number of air travel, because buses and cars pollute air too. Everybody who is interested in clear air guesses that this problem will be solute as fast as it is possible, but at the same times, they do not want to pay high tax and have a limited flying.
