In the modern world people travel a lot. One of the most convenient way is travel by plane. Some people consider that it loods to air pollution and global warming and government should create special law to decrease the number the number of planes fly. I partly agree with it and this assay will include some arguments against it. 
On the one hand, it is difficult to imagine life without planes. People vary often use this kind of transport because of its speed and comfortable. Sometimes it can be the cheapest transport for long distance. Moreover, plane can fly in some areas were cars, ships or trains can not go. What about business, it very convenient for people to go to the other countries or even countinents for emergency.
On the other hand, air travel is one of the reason of air pollution or maybe worse global warming. In some cases, it is a good idea to have some laws about it. Of course, government canâ€™t forbit all the air travels, but it could allow people to fly with high taxes. If it is an emergency, people will fly equally. If it can reduce the number of people which fly because they used to do it.
What is more, government should improve alternatives, for example, new comfortable trains with 1st class.
In conclusion, I want to say that it is necessary to reduce the number of air travel, but it could be done correctly.
