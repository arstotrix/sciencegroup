There is a provement that travelling by air leads to an enermous amount of ecological problems. There are a lot of flights that are not important nowadays, that is why it is necessary to have some legal norms to decline out travelling?
In my opinion, introducing some legal norms or law documents is actual question for goverment, if officials want to save enviroment. Firstly, there are a lot of people with high level of income who prefer flying indipendently, not on public aircars. It is not doubt, that such private transport have a big amount of air pollation and emit high temperature. Moreover, there are a lot of sport teams such as football teams, where now a lot of investing, which also prefer private transport. Secondly, flying on helicopters is very prestigious modern entertaiment fro reach people. However, daring the flight on this transport are emmited a lot of gases such as dioxyde (CO2), carboxyde and others, so it leads to air pollution.
On the other hand, there air some air travels which are very important. First of all, some political bysinesses when president of minesters should get to some other country immidietly. Therefore such occasions should not be banned in laws although it contributes a great amout of air pollution too.
To conclude, I would like to say that law's requirements are necessary in the sphere of air travelling because nowadays the enviromental problems are very actual. That is why goverment should reduce in legal norms using of private air transport or flying without any serious business.
