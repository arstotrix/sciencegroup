The charts shows changes in the use of Facebook from 2012 to 2013 and the main reasons for using it among men and women. The first thing that attracts attention is increase in among of mobile application users from March 2012 to March 2013 – almost to times – from 50 to 100 millions of users. Consequently, there is a tendency to use mobile application rather than desktop. Second bar chart shows that women use Facebook for sharing photos and videos more often mens. However, there is no differences between percentage of men and women who tougt that the main reason for using this social network is receiving updates. It is quite unbelievable that only 30% of people found “receiving updates”  the main reason, because social network is aimed to show updates in people’s lifes and different news. The most unpopular reason is learning about ways to help each other, mostly in mens. I think, it shouldn’t be shoking, because people’s got used to use social network for entertainment, not for work. Summing it up, Facebook is one of the most popular IT organizations in the world, and number of people who use it rapidly increases. So, this organizations should provide wide opportunities for user and try to make reasons for using this social network useful.
