Nowadays air travel for business became more and more popularity. Someone make a deal during the flying, other just want to show successful and beautiful life. Despite on reason all of air travel pollution our enviroment. How the governments should solve the problem in this case?
On the one hand, privat air travel have only damage influence on enviroment. Humanity may facing with serious problem, for examples global warming, air pollution and other. Of course in this case goverments should introduce laws to reduce privat air travels.
Also, privat air travels may be because resons to air crash. For examples, in Siberia in 2005 passenger air lainers meet the privat air lainers. Many of people was death.
On the other hand, privat air travels may help to some people. People, who have a big business and companies oftn do the charity. In this case privat air travels became usefull. Also, people who have personal air plane pay more taxes. If goverments introduce law, which reduce some privat travels owners the airplane doesnâ€™t buy this transport and tax will decrease.
In conclusion, this question have positive and negative site, of course. However, in my opinion goverments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travels for personal. This law help to us to save our environmental and decrease to air crash. However, I think goverments should also remember to people, who needed to privat air travels for health and medicine help in different counties and regions.
