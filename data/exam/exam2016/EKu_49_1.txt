It contains information about developed and developing countries and the world total amount of investment. It can be seen from the bar chart that the developed countries tend to invest larger sums of money to support the renewable energy supplies. The amount of money invested varies from approximately 70 billion dollars to 170 billion dollars. Developing countries give less money to renewable energy development - from 25 billion dollars to 100 billion dollars. The chart also shows that from 2006 to 2008 the investment of both developing and developed countries grows significantly, but during the next four years there is no evident trend for the developed countries. Nevertheless, developing countries constantly increase the investment and only in the end of a period given there is a slight decrease. Tha bar chart depicts that the investment for the developed countries falls dramatically in the last three years of a period of time given.
