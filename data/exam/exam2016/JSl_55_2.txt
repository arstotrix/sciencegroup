Recently, a lot of international corporations decided to move their industries to developing countries and employ local people as a staff. While the process continues, it rose many arguments, as there are both advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, there are several positive points of such a movement. Firstly, it is cheaper for the companies themselves to produce their goods on the territories of poorer countries because both the rent and the labour force are priced much more lower. Secondly, employing local citizens of these developing countries, large corporations usually provide them with job opportunities, as the countries economy doesn’t allow it’s own people to open such businesses. For example, such famous international companies as Apple of Samsung placed their plants in China and other Asian countries, which is cheaper for them and, at the same time, it gives the local pollution lots of work opportunities. However, on the other hand, such kind of policy have some disadvantages. The most important one is that having those plants and factories built on their territories, poor countries are prevented from the developing process as they usually only play some kind of supporting a role for developing countries and their economies. The second disadvantage is environmental problems caused by the production. While, for instance, Europes and The United States ecology doesn’t suffer from the pollution caused by numerous plants and factories, Asians’ does. Talking everything into consideration, the problem of location of international companies’ businesses I developing countries is a very controversial issue. There are both advantages in an economic sphere and at the same time disadvantages in an ecological one.
