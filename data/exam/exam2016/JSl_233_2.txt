In the recent years planes became more popular so the number of flights increased. However, airplanes are polluting environment which requires response from the government. I partly agree with the propounded government policy of cancelling some unnecessary routes, thinking that we should take into consideration but consequences of such decisions. There is no doubt, that air planes cure harming over environment and sometimes should be made to restrict this negative impact. I think that the government should cancel some lowercost air travellings. These flight are unexpansive and so are less productive. I mean that such planes can carry less passengers and so seem to produce a greater amount of pollution per one passenger. Also I think that some of the local flights can be categorized as unnecessary because of existing alternative tools of transport but not so many local flights should be cancelled if the problem with pollution needs to be solved. I consider that the main problem with cancelling of unnecessary flights is arising when we ask what will happen if the travelers will atilize other means of transport instead of planes. If the journey is long and destination point is for away an attention should by put on the level of pollution produced by another means of transport. Cars, trains and other means are still not green and are contributing to the global warming as well as plaines. For example, if we consider that the passenger who has no opportunity to travel by plain due to the government decision will seat in his car and if we imagine big amount of these passengers. To sum up, I consider that some of the flights should be cancelled by government but not a lot of them. Government should be aware of provoking bigger pollution by alternative means of transport.
