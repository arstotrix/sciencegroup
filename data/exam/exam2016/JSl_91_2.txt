Today some world spread companies prefer to make their business in the developing countries and to take locals for working. According to theme, there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages. Moreover, I believe that moving business in poor and developing countries has more cons. On the one hand, moving business in developing countries helps governments to understand how to make international shipping, and, moreover, helps to rise the level of economy. Furthermore, it can cause better developing in country than career. For example, is 80’s Vietnam was developing countries, but during that decade this country rise the level of economy’s sphere, becoming one of the biggest country of export in South-Asian region, because many international companies move business to this countries and employ vietnamies. On the other hand, it has bad effects on local citizens. When international companies open their business in developing countries, it decline native business and also can destroy the country’s economy. Moreover, I truly believe that, it also can influence on international policy, and can cause polician war. Nevertheless, many local workers who are employing for working often do not want to work for immigrant derictory. For instance, German company moved business to China. First years of working the company was misunderstanding why employees do not want to work. Only after three month later they understand than Chinese always need breakfast at 12 o’clock. In conclusion, I would like to say that moving business to poorer, developing countries has more advantages and disadvantages, however international companies should forget about difference between countries and its investment.
