The first bar chart given illustrate how the use of Facebook with a desktop and a mobile phone changed over a year-period from the month of march in 2012 to that of 2013 while the second chart indicates why men and women use Facebook. From the first graph it can be deduced that the number of people who used Facebook with desktop  has slightly decreased by 2013 accounting for approximately 130 million of users as opposed to about 150 million in 2012. In contrast, mobile phone has become much more popular among Facebook users with the performance of about 95 million of users in 2013, which is circa 40 million more than in 2012. Nevertheless, the indices of mobile Facebook remaned significantly lower than those of desktop Facebook, reaching a peak at about 95 and 150 million of users, respectively.  As it can be seen from the second graph, the majority of women, namely 54 %, consider that sharing photos or videos is the main purpose to use Faceboof while men vote equally for sharing files and receiving updates. The less important reason among both men and women seems to be learning about the ways to help others, moreover, this reason has the same percentage of voters among women as seeing funny posts. All in all, though the usage of mobile Facebook has sharply increased by 2013, the totat performance of Facebook use has dropped significantly. The main reason for use it slightly differs among man and women though sharing photos and videos stays the most popular.
