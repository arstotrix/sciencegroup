Nowadays, the question of the environmental problems became one of the reasonable point to discuss it. It is supposed that travelling by airplane people have risk to prove to contribute to air pollution and global warming and as a consequence to tackle this problem, the government should provide some new power legislation that will allow to cut the amount of air travel as for business and holiday reasons. I totally agree with the idea of introducing a new legislation. This essay will look on some points of this view. It has been assumed that nowadays the issue of global warming is becoming an acute problem and governments and international organisations tend to resolve this problem by introducing some effective rules. I have long held that the main helpful way to prevent air pollution and global warming is to cut a great deal of air travel. For instance government should attribute to the air companies to reduce significantly the number of flights in order to make air far more fresh and cleaner. Additionaly, the government and international organization such as United Nation Organization should act in effective way wich will encourage people to be law-abiding and as a consequence to follow rules wich will help us to protect our environmental and reduce air pollution. The way forward might be to introduce the law which will allow people to travel only ones a month. Personally speaking, this rule could help to save our planet from a big number of futureâ€™s problems and will encourage people to carry about the place where they live and brith in order to being healthy and in a good stay of life.
