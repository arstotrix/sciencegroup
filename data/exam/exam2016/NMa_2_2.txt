Nowadays one of the most popular issues in the whole world are air pollution and global warming. So, governments argue that it is a great idea to reduce the usage of planes when travelling. I totally disagree with it.
Firstly, it is not a secret that every mean of transport may cause serious air pollution. So, it does not matter if people travel by bus, by train or by plane. Personnaly I think that cars make the biggest negative impact on the atmosphere, but surely not travelling by air.
Another argument is a level of comfort. Usually it is more conviniet for a person to sit in a soft chair with a cup of tea and a meal for some hours than spend time with many strangers in a train and get bored for much longer time.
Moreover, almost every businessman faced with a situation when they have an important event far away from the city and very little time left before it. Of course the only way to be there in time is to go by plane, because it is the fastest mean of transport.
Finally, one argument connected with money. Sometimes in the last days before the departure tikets on the train could be really expencive nd not everybody have enough money to pay for it. So, it may be even cheaper to find an appropriate race on plane.
To sum up it is important to notice that I am totally against limitations of air travellig, because it is not the most harmful mean of transport and in these way the idea of government will just reduce people's opportunity.
