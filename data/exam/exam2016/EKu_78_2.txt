The international business becomes more and more popular in modern world. Many companies moves their factories and productions to poor developing countries instead of working in their own country. Why is it so popular and what advantages does it bring? Firstly, organizing business in developing countries is much cheaper than in developed ones. For example, employment of working staff costs less money for business in developing countries and often employer doesn't have to provide employees with any bonuses and perks as poor countries have poor salaries and no undertading of medical and social assuarence that company usually provides in developed countries. And also business in other country helps to escape some taxes in your own country that may be a burden for businessmen. Secondly, such business provides great amount of working places for poor people and increases their level of wellness. Often these companies help to organize the structure of the place, where it's situated in general. However, this kind of business may not be profitable as the supplyment and export should be organized and this costs may be harmful for business. Also international giants may become a divide for developing of local businesses that are very important for developing countries. But local companies aren't able to compete with international ones as local businssmen lack the experience and fiances in comparison to their competitors. In conclusion I'd like to say that there should be balance between local and international businesses and international companies shouldn't be a divide for development of the country in general. However I find this tendency of moving business mostly positive as for those who have business and for developing areas where it's placed.
