The chart illustrates the revenue percentages of the internatilnally spread companies which are producing smartphones for the global market since 2010 up to 2015. Overall the changes in shares of the given companies’ revenues, which are Apple, Samsung, Blackberry and HTC, are quite diverse, however in overall we can group them into halves by the following trends: the ever-decreasing share of profit (Blackberry and HTC) and differentiative trend of the revenue shares’ changes (Apple and Samsung). The most profitable smartphone producer of all is Apple with higest share of revenue reaching 70% in 2012 and 90% in 2015. We can assume that Apple is a leading company of the industry in terms of the revenue approach. Apple suffered from the slight decrease in it’s share only in 2013 when it dropped from 70 to 60% in 2013, whereas the share of Samsung increased from 40 to 45% in 2012 during the exact same period of time. Hence, Apple and Samsung might be considered to be the closest opponents on the given market. The other two companies – Blackberry and HTC – never had had a considerable revenue share from 2010 to 2015 while it was ranging from 0 to 5% for Blackberry and 15-5% for HTC. The main tendency for these companies is the plunge of the profit percentage from 2011 to 2015, in which the aforementioned producers followed the same pattern of their revenue shares’ change. Overall, the shares of all companies were growing from 2010 to 2012 (from 40 to 70% for Apple, from 15 to 45% for Samsung, from 10 to 15 for HTC, and the stable 20% give or take for Blackberry). However, from the point of 2011 until the recent times (2015) the pattern of changes for the profit shares of Samsung and Apple have become completely oppositional. If Apple reaches it’s peak at 90% share of profit in 2015, Samsung gets to it’s lowest point of 15% around the same time.
