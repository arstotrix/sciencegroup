The graph gives information on how many boys and girls from different parts of the world had no chance for primary education in 2000 and 2012. The region of Africa shows the highest level of the data.


As it may be conluded from the chart all regions have a decline in the rates of number of children without access to primary education. Africa shows leading position, the number of children with no access hits the pick of 43,7 millions people in 2000. South Asia is at the same level of numeracy in 2000 as Africa is in 2012. The situation of primary education access is much better in the rest of the world (in 2012 the number is half less then in Africa). From 2000 to 2012 the situation rapidly changes in South Africa. As it may be seeing from the graph the number of boys and girls with access to education in 2012 in that region is way less then in the rest of the world the same year.


In conclusion more children have chance to have a primary education in 2012 than in 2000. But it is a well-recognized dinamic that girls have less opportunities for education all over the world.
