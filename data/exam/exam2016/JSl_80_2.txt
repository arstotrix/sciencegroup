In the modern world many international corporations use not reach developing countries as a business ground. For example, to use the local people who need job, such model of business has a lot of advantages and disadvantages. On the one hand, it is very beneficial in the modern world. Firstly, it helps developing countries to involve the process of globalization. Secondly, the economy of such countries develops with the growth of foreign investments. Thirdly, this model of business creates a lot of work places and fights the unemployment which is a very serious problem especially for developing countries. For instance, there were a lot of unemployed people in Arabic countries during the first half of 20th century. Then the oil source were explored and many foreign companies moved business there and Arabic countries started to develop very fast and solved the problem of unemployment. N the other hand, such a movement of business takes workplaces from the countries this business comes. For example, when “Apple” moved their factories to Asia a lot of workers in America became unemployed. Another disadvantage is that the developing countries may become dependent of the foreign business and as a result of the foreign country. Furthermore, businessmen usually do not pay local workers as much as they would pay in their own country. This is rather profitable but unhonest to people who work for them. To sum up, this system of business movement helps both businessmen and developing countries. Of course, there are some negative consequences but such model is just a part of globalization, the process which cannot be stopped. As a result poor countries should use all of the advantages of it and try to reduce the disadvantages, which, in my opinion, do not outweigh the disadvantages.
