In a lot of modern families both parents go out to work and children spend less time with their parents than they did in the past. There are a few reasons for this situation. First of all, there are a large lack between the level of education in 1900s and nowadays. Now we live in the world with the free education for women like for men. In past, women should knew only the numerous, painting and playing the piano. Today women can be doctors, astrophysycists or presidents. And there are lots of women who want to take a strongly career. So today there are lots of working mam as and free-child pairs. Secondly, we live in the world, where the lack from poor and rich are gigantically. Lots of people haven’t money for their “firstly needs”. But all of children need eat, home, education and other needs. So, in this time both of parents must working a lot, and as a result spend less time with their kids. In my opinion, here are some problems which can be caused. One of this problems are cause in that case: parents which go out to the work and working in interesting places can be takes their children lots of interesting and useful information. But on the other side children, which parents spend notime with them, come away from their pareints. They don’t think any more that their parents are their best friends. They can takes a relationships with bad or angry persons and bring a lot of problems, than they are alone at home. To conclusion this topic, there are different reasons go out work, if you have babies, and lots of reasons for don’t do it, but all the time it is personal choise of the parents. When I was a child my father went out from my mom and my mom worked a lot. Once, she came not to my birthday party. I was very angry to her. Nowadays I see that my mom loves her work, she successful chief executive officer and I love her so much.
