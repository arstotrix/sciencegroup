Nowadays it is believed that air transport is really harmful for our environment. That is why, the authority ough to decrease this influence by laws, which solve the problem with unnecessary flights. I agree with this point of view, but it is stupendous to bear in mind that no all airplanes provide the issue.

Firstly, due to produced gas and waste, the air travel became a source of air, water and noise pollution. Nowadays it is impossible to live near such kind of buildings because of a dangerous impact on out health. So, the best way to improve the situation is changes in the laws.

Secondly, the train is a great alternative for airplans and other air transport in many cases. It is cheaper and more comfortable. Moreover, there are unpopular directions, in which the tickets are not bought a lot. So, it could be decrease the number of these travel by laws in order to best fulling of people.

On the other hand, due to technical progress there are modern versions of air transport that reduce the amount of gas and harmful waste. If goverment invest in this project, it is not necessary to not allow air travel.

To sum up, there is no doubt, that the air pollution and global changes are the result of huge amount of dayly travelling by planes. I am absolutely sure that investment in the temporary technology by goverment help to avoid this situation in the future.
