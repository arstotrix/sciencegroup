Nowadays problem of ecology and environment is rather acute and many people are alarmed by it. One of these issues is contamination of atmosphere and rising temperatures over the world. Followed by these thoughts some people try to make a solution and offer to limit the use of air transport. I think this proposal is not far-going  and should be regarded thoroughly. This essay will cover pros and cons of this reform.
To start with, it is argumental that plans do much harm to atmosphere becaus quality of fuel is constantly increasing and it is intended to be more eco-friendly. Besides, I believe that air transport plays an important role in global transportation due to it's numerous conveniences: price, speed, ability to get difficult and far places and so on. Finally, if authorities start to implement some regulations in favour of lower-flight policy, people probably will be shocked and will show their dissatisfaction and protest what can result in serious consequences.
However, some people disagree saying that environmental problems is the care of every citizen in modern world and we should not treat to air pollution and global warming so irresponsibly. Moreover, they claim that there are many alternative transport types such as car, train and ship. Nonetheless, I can not accept these opinions because every person has a choice and if his or her preference is to travel by plane and do harm to environment he should do it and should respect this choice. Finally, in my experience there were some cases when I had to get somewhere less than a day and I did not have an opportunity to get, for instance, by bus. Stricter rules of air travel would bring be many problems.
To conclude, our governments should be reasonable and take into account all advantages and disadvantages of flight-limiting preasures in pursuit of ecology. As for me, it is better to improve ecology by waste less industries, energy-saving devices and improving quality of fuel for transport.
