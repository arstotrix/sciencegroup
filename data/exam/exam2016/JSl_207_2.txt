The crime rate is one of the most significant feature that almost all of the countries try to reduce thought the decades. Some of the government introduce more severe laws to punish the criminals, while others try to create more light conditions both in judgment and prison systems. In this essay I am going to spotlight both of them and try to came up my own opinion. From one hand, the main purpose of the law is to prevent people from commiting a crime. Consequently, it is undoubtedly fair that long prison sentences or even death penalties wile scare those who decide to commit a crime however, the practice show that this does not really works, for instance, in USA, where the prison sentences are almost the highest in the world, but the problem of high crime rates is still persisting over there. Furthermore, governments spend a lot of money for detailing prisons and that is what tax-payers citizens a lot. From the other side, there exists a bench of ways to reduce crime that are applied all over the developed countries. Norway prisons are considered of the best in the world and the prison sentences could not be mor than 21 years for men and even less for women in that country. Interestingly, that the crime rates are the lowest thorought the years in that country. The main reasons for applying such a loyal conditions is that prison have to reabilitat criminals rather than punishment and prosecute them. In Spain and significant there exists special program for those, who just quite the prison. Those programs are designed to help to find a good job and reintegrate in the society for those people, who had been isolated from others so long. To sum up, I think that both ways might good for a particular country. However, I believe that society should overpass that period of just prosecuting laws and to came up with more intelligent and humane ones.
