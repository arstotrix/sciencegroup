Nowadays we can’t find a person who doesn’t fly by the plane. However, there is a group of people who think, that it is unnecessary type of travel and disadvantages of this travels are too strong. The opponents maintain the idea that this type of travelling brings only problems. Firstly, airtravel is a reason of air pollution and global warming. Moreover, they claim the idea that it can be a reason of lack of gas and oil other resources. Moreover, it is so dangerous to fly by plane there are so many falling planes and it is more safety to travel by car, train, ship and etc. however, there is another group of people who claim that plane is the one of best thing to the business leisure. They maintain that it is the fastest and very safety vechile. Moreover, people can’t imagine their everyday life without planes. Because how can people see another countries in our modern century? If he travel by ship or train it will takes days, but by plane it will take some hours. What is more, modern planes and future planes will consumpt solar and other nature resources which would not bring a pollution in any type. Personally I disagree with a statement. Because modern plane become better every time and I think it is a future type of travelling to the people. Well, after giving a careful consideration to the above points it seems adviasable to say, that I can’t agree with the following topic. Air travel needs to the common people to travel, to make business, not only to the government and army.
