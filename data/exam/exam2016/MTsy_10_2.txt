It was proved, that air travel greatly contribute to air pollution and it’s one of the main reasons of global warming. Governments believe, that a lot of air travel is not so important and it should be better to introduce new laws to reduce the number of air travel for leisure and business. As for me, I can’t totally agree with one of these statements, because they both are right.
On one hand, people live on our planet for a lot of years, for millions of years. So they affected the environment for a long time. Moreover, we destroy our planet over and over again. In our modern world, full of new technologies of destruction, we must to take care of our planet more, then ever. And it’s possible to understand opinion of governments, because they take care of ecology. It’s not a bad idea to create some new laws to contor the amount of air travel. However, where are a lot of questions without asks. For example, how they will decide who can travel and who can’t? If I want to travel abroad on the plane to see Paris for a second time, what should I do? Actually, there are a lot of such questions. Ecological problem is very serious, but is it right to said people what should they do? I really wan’t to fly abroad do why should I ask anyone about it? It’s a free world, where you can visited any country for any reason. This is the other point of view.
To conclude, I’d must to say that I think, that the second point of view is more correctly, because we can’t safe our planet, it’s too late, but can help to take care of her by other way. Reduce the amount of air travel is not the best method. We can find something better.
