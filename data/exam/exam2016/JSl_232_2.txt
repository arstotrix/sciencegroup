It is considered that air travel in large quantities can pollute the air. Some people say that governments should decrease the number of air trips. Others claim that air travel is necessary business and leisure. To begin with, sometimes the air space is “overcrowded” by flying planes, what definitely leads to air pollution. On websites like flightradar24.com everyone can watch each plane on the Earth and can learn necessary information about its’ destination, height speed and so on. This site can show that regions like Europe and North America are “invisible” behind the plane sign on the radar. There are many positive planes, which are used for business travel or for transportation some VIP persons. To reduce the number of these planes governments have to introduce the special law that lets use private air travel only with a permission. Another problem of large amount of air travel is dispatch work. When there too many planes in one region it is very difficult to dispatch to control the situation. Sometimes the overpressure lead to wrong decision and, consequently, to plane crash. In summer of 2002, in Germany the dispatch, who had to watch after two regions, made a mistake, which lead to collision of two planes and 70 victims, including so children. That is why number of air travel should be reduced in terms of safety. However, in different regions planes are frequently used to protecting the nature from disasters like fires, apposite, have to been increased. In many possible way of travelling that is why it can nt be abandoned in there. To sum up, the development in technologies improves many industries including air travel. Making better qualities and characteristics of planes will probably makes them less harmful to the extremal area and will reduce their amount in the air.
