Nowadays there is a tendence to be an international human, that means, to travel a lot, to work abroad and to have a rest in other cities and countries. That leads to the overuse of air means of transport which causes air pollution and global warming effect. Some people believe that there is nothing serious in thousands of planes in the sky. Others think that it is a great threat to the environment and we have to cut down the amount of air travel. As far as I am concerned the plane is the fastest way of travelling in the world. For example, it takes just a few hours to fly from Moscow to Saint-Petersburg compared with 10 hours wasted in a car or a train. Moreover, it is much more convinied and less dangerouse than going by bus. Sometimes it is the only possible method to move from one place to another. Finally, today there are government programmes which make the airlines companies install “green” engines in planes in order to reduce the amount of exhausted gases going out in the atmosphere and, as the result, cut down air pollution. On the other hand, not so many airlines use environment friendly equipment these days because it costs enough and companies have no profit from it. Furthermore, there are a lot of extremely old planes which are 20 or more years old. All in all, these factors make us think twice abut the introduction of special laws not to reduce only the amount of air travel but to cut down the amount of waste produced by one plane. To sum up, it is strongly believed that the number of air travelling as an essential part of the word infrastructure. Trying to block it will lead to terrible consequences for the world economy, culture and other spheres of human activity. However, we should do our bets to make the plane not become the factor which destroys our planet.
