The bar chart plots how the number of children who have no opportunity to get primary education changed from 2000 to 2012 by region and gender. In 2000 Africa was the leader, according to the chart. Around 44 millions of children were limited in getting primary education. However, by 2012 this number decreased dramatically and became the same as it was in South Asia in 2012 â€“ approximately 33 millions. There was a fantastic decline in number of children in South Asia in 2012. Only 10 millions instead of 33 could not go to primary school. The same downward trend could be mentioned in the rest of the world (from around 25 millions to a bit more than 15). There were not big difference between boys and girls who have no possibilities to go to school. In Africa, and the rest of the world these numbers were equal. But in 2000 in South Asia boys were less discriminated than girls (21.6 millions of girls and 11.1 of boys). Overall, by 2012 the situation with these children became better in all countries, but in Africa still a lot of children have no available education and South Asia this number is less.
