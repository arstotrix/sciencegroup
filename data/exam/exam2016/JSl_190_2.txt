In this era of huge cities and private poverty it is common to see high crime rate. Countries produce several ways to protect people and the most popular is to give longer prison sentences. But sometimes there are more effective ways to reduce crime. The most common is to held prisoners for a long time. This would mean that in perspective governments would reduce number of prisoners on the freedom. This idea is used when people need to deal with rapidly growing crime rate fast. When future prisoners think of making money or killing someone, they would think about how law protects his target, hence, sometimes crime would be cenceld. There is one a very huge drawback in this method the cost of a prison. Every quard, dog cell and room in a prison building cost doubled because of the risk. And this money would be taken from locals, what should in the future provide an idea for crime. This close connection between money spend on prisons and crime rate is an underwater rocks for many laws and ways to deal with crimes. But, there are ways to solve this problem. Prisoners are people wich potentially could do a hard work. If government can provide a special building for working with materials  like wood or metal, this can afford to not just help people to reabilitise, but also a few money. Several American state prisons already involved this possibility to a right way. The conclusion here is simple, longer prison sentences has not only an advantages and drawbacks too. The key to success in reducing crime rate is rehabilitation. If prisons can provide it, ay method can be helpful.
