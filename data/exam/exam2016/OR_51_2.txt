Nowadays environmental problems stand out as important global issues. So many people claim that air travel, which makes a significant countribution to air pollution and global warming, should be restricted by governmental laws. Personally, I can only partly agree with this opinion. To begin with, air travel is the fastest way of commuting. That doesn’t mean only personal convenience: an ability to change places quickly makes economic perfomances of firms more effective, reduces transactional costs, presenting benefits to the whole economic system. Moreover, decrease in use of planes will result in growth of the number of people traveling by cars and by trains which also contribute to air pollution. Nevertheless, some people may argue that the impact of air travel on environment is too massive to come up with it easily. Only governmental laws can alfer the situation as the industry itself won’t clearly take any actions and people in general are not ready to sacrifise the benefits air travel brings. Personally, I cannot fully agree with this argument as governmental intrusion in this industry can cause major economical problems that would be difficult to handle. Furthermore, I think that modern pace of life is simply impossible to maintain without having  fast way of commuting. Today only air travel meets this requirment. All in all, I believe that despite having some drawbacks, a lot of air travel is absolutely necessary in the modern world. The advantages of this mean of transport outweigh its disadvantages.
