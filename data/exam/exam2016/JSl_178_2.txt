There are several points of view on reducing crime. Some tend to belive that the best way is longer prison sentence. While others argue that there are better ways. Both view have their pros and cons. Increasing prison sentence can prevent some people from doing crime as they will know about risk of spending most of their lifes in prison. But there is another side of  this solution. First of all, prosins will take more money. From country budget as prison has to spent more on every prisoner. Second and may be even more important. Criminals will go for a higher crimes to avoid prison. For example, theift can kill a man to avoid being caughted. Last problem is connects with the first one. Government will ned to built more prisons to keep all criminals. It also have money from budget. But do we have after native ways? Yes, there are some other possible silutions to prevent crime. First one is reducing number of unemployment people. A lot of people go for crime just because they do not have something do it. Giving them job can prevent them from going for crime. Second approach is to start with children. Most of the crimals start doing illegal brings from the childhood. It is very important for parents of trachers, child phycologists to make sure that one do not got for a wrong rond. Of course, there are many other small steps that can help. In my opinion, longer prison sentences certainly is not the right solution, so we have to concentrate on alternative approaches and combine them for better results.
