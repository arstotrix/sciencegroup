It is a well-known fact that we are living in a fast-moving world. And nowadays we have a lot of different opportunities with the help of technological advances. The sphere of transport is not an exception. However, many people have doubts about transport innovations and assert that they have a considerable impact on pollution and other ecological problems. This question might be considered controversial. First of all, modern technologies make our lives easier and more convenient. With the invention if our transport can reach the place of destination very quickly and we do not need to waste our time. Moreover, air transport always provides an excellent service, comfortable sits, access to the internet. And nowadays it is not scary to fly. Furthermore, you can travel to another side of the world, experience different cultures, get unforgettable emotions and broaden your horizons. In addition, you can travel for business as well.
On the other hand, air travel contributes qreatly to air pollution. It also may be considered as a cause of global warming. The reason is harmful gases that are trown into the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this fact could not be argued.
Personally, I side with those who claim that there should not be laws which restricts the purposes of travelling. I think that air travelling makes our lives more comfortable, easy and certainly more exciting. And it gives an amazing opportunity to travel and we should not miss this. Therefore, I have to disagree almost entirely with the given statement.
