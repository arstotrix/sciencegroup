Some people claim that transportation by air is the cause of such ecological problems as air pollution and global warming. They also say there should be proper law regulations which are supposed to decrease the rate of using aircrafts. But the others argue that it is unnecessary and air travel should not be regulated. To my opinion, such steps to reducing the number of air transportation are pointless because they limit people's possibility to move around the world and can make several problems for our globalisafied society.
When the humanity invented the first working air plane, everybody achieved the opportunity to travel. Since then people learned how to move from one place to another during several hours. and now we can not imagine our lifes without this last transportation. If governments decide to introduce laws and rules controlling air travel, there will be a disaster. For example, many people are connected with travelling and it is extremely important to have access to air travel industry for them.
But on the other side our planet is dying. every day, every single moment because of pollution. Laws and other regulations can help to stop this awful process, for instance, by prohibiting private air crafts who make harm too like real planes used by many travel companies.
To sum it up, the current issue is too complicated and it do not have only one right solution. I think that there is no necessarity to create strict laws and to reduce air travel rate but we should also think of our planet harmed and damaged by our actions because it is home for future generations.
