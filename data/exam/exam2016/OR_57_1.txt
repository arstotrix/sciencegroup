On the graph there is represented the level of children who do not have access to primary education change for the period of time from 2000 to 2012, separated by geographic and gender indicators. The data on the graph demonstrates the situation in Africa, South Asia and Rest of World. As it can be seen from it during the time from 2000 to 2012 the number of children, both boys and girls, who do not have access to primary school education, decreased in each of three represented regions (from 23.7 to 18.2 and from 20 to 14.5 in Africa; from 21.6 to 4.8 and 11.1 to 5.1 in Asia; from 12.8 to 7.6 and 10.5 to 7.7 millions of children in Rest of World). The most positive tendency takes place in South Asia, where the number of such children became less for more than two times. It is necessary to note, that according to the gender criteria, the number of girls without access to primary school education is much higher than in Rest of World.
