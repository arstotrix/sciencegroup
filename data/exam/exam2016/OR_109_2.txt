Nowadays one of the most controversial topic for debates is parents should spend more time with their children or they should go out to work and make money for future of their children. In my opinion, money is nessessery thing for building the excellent future, without it parents can not give a good education, food, clothes, smartphone, travel in another country, where we can learn a foreign language. Let’s think about this in my essay. From one viewpoint is that this “problem” have understanding reasons. It is the new century, the century of speed, information. All happen very fast. People began to think about their job and careers more, than they did in the past. They began to care about future and not only their future, but also the future of their children. Parents of modern families understand that without money, they can not give a good education a travel in another country to learn English, for instance. Moreover, parents do not buy a medicine card for their children, so that they can not help them, when they will have an illness. However, from negative side, this practise can cause some problems, especially in relationship between parents and their children. Kids can not understand, why their parents not always be with them. It is leads, that they feel nervous and lost the line with parents. May be in future children can understand them, but always think that their parents do not love them. In conclusion, reflecting all mentioned topic, I have to agree that modern parents should go out to work for the good future of their parents, but they should remember pay attention children affer work or on weekend. I think that this can be a right sollution for this situation.
