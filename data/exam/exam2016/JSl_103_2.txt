The huge number of different companies exist in our modern world. Every year a lot of companies open their businesses all over the globe. Some companies are international and owners of these companies develop their business in different countries that could be poor. On the one hand, this process will help to develop these countries, because some countries have no jobs for native people. If one person finds a good job with big salary, it will help its family. I suppose that children will be able to go to school with better education these people will be able to buy some good drugs in pharmacies and good food. An economic of these countries will increase. Conditions for life will become better. Companies that will open their businesses in poor countries also will have some benefits. The first is an increase of staff. The second is an  increase of consumers all over the world. The third is that companies will become more famous. The fourth it is cheap. On the other hand, people in these countries mostly poo and they won’t be able to buy something and maybe these items aren’t need them. So it could have a negative effect. Sometimes developing countries have no need to have foreign companies on their territorial places. In conclusion, in my opinion, the opening businesses in poor countries has more advantages than disadvantages because these countries will have new opportunities to develop. The owners of these companies also will be able to produce more items than before.
