The people suppose that stronger punishment is the solution of the world crime problem, but some of them think there is best way. So who is right and would we find better way? According the statistics, the number of prisoners in developed countries is less. I suppose, there are less lifestyle problems than after countries. Consequently, if we increase lifestyle level, the rate of crimes will be reduced. It is difficult way because of economics of undeveloped countries and crisys conditions in the crime world. The psychologists say: that the main problem of crime situation was created by familie of prisoners and criminals. Bad familie conditions like drunk or drug addicted father or mother has an impact on young children. Consequently, they became robbers or in the worse way murders. I totally agree with the opinion in the topic that the stronger punishment is usefull way. But how about the judge? Corrupted judges and terrible punishment. What about the law? If a robber go to your home and you hurt him you will be punish not him. I suppose, the first stop to the topic world is to change our law and judge. However, how I said after, we have a corruption problem which has a beginning in familie and the familie problem started from lifestyle. Lifestyle is influenced by law. It is infinite cycle and I would find only one solution to build the system and people mind by the white paper. To conclusion, people believe there is the best solution for criminal problem and I want to believe too. But I really think we will not solve it since thousand years too.
