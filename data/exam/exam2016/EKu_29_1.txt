The bar charts provide information on the number of people accessing Facebook via desktops and mobile phones in the period from 2012-2013, and the main reasons for using the social network. As can be seen from the charts, there are several differences in how men and women use Facebook. In 2013, desktops remain the most popular device: about 150 million women and almost 140 million men use their PCs and laptops to surf Facebook. The number of people accessing it with their mobiles is smaller: about 60 million women and 100 million men. For some reason, fewer women than men chose mobiles to use Facebook in 2012-2013. Unsurprisingly, both men (39%) and women (54%) name sharing photos and videos among their main reasons to use Facebook. From this information, it may be concluded that females tend to be more social, and a greater percentage of them enjoys sharing personal pictures. An equal percent (39%) of men and women claimed that they mostly use Facebook to recieve updates from other users. The other reasons for using the social network are seeing funny posts ad learning about ways to help others. These two reasons are also more popular among women.
