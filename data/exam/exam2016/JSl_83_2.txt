Many companies which transfer their business through national borders, prefer to relocate it to poorer countries. This tendency has its disadvantages which although seem to be overcome by advantages. On the one hand, such companies seem to employ poor and thus cheap labour force of developing countries making their own good only. For instance, it is really cheaper to hire a person in India than in the US. Moreover, developing countries put less regulations concerning labour safety and ecology. This also brings the price of production down. It is nonetheless important to consider the destroying influence which such trans-national companies have on local markets. For example, the flood of European products hurts the economy of almost any country joining the Europen Union. On the other hand, exploitation of the local labour force and having production of an international company brings a lot of positive things to developing country. First of all, is solves the unemployment problem for the hosting country. Big companies in China, for instance, provide local population with a great number of work places. Secondly, such companies increase the national revenue of the poor countries investing in their economy. Above all, international business brings international standarts of ecology and labour safety. Moreover, it sometime tries to solve local problems in society. For example, the fund of Ronal McDonald which is famous for initiating the investments to help children with cancer or to simply build a playground in local city. To conclude, international companies which move their businesses to developing countries might be located at negatively with all the potential risks that they bring. However, the positive effects of such movements shadow these risks bringing new technology and investments in such countries. It might also be the natural way to shorten the gap between the first and the second world in the nearest future.
