Nowadays, there are many different plans, which can be used for visiting other countries, for business or travelling. But same people people say that Air travel has a mall influence on air pollution and global warming and goverments should forbite such many flying and input the law, which will do it.
As been clearly understand that the big amount of planes makes noise and exhaust, but it very comfortable type of transport. Also it is very fast. If you want to go abroad, you will fly by the plane, because you will spend 5â€“8 hours. If you choose the car, you will spend about a week. Moreover, according to statistics, cars make more noise and gamage of nature. Of course, if goverments think that alot of air travel is unnecessary, can introduce laws to reduce the number of air travel for business and leisure. While many people think that It is necessary. With development plants are changed and now It is more safety then It was 10 years ago and also It burn less fuil now. We should about future and now scientists work an the new disel oil, which will safety for air pollusion and global warming
In conclusion, I would say that air travel is necessary for people, because anyone want to wach other countries, their culture, to solve this business problems. In my opinion the govement shoul find sollusion in other areas.
