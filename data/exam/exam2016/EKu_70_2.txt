Today international companies tend to locate in undeveloped countries and work with their citizens. The buisiness becomes cheaper and the fortune made by companies is higher. There are some advantages and disadvantages of this way of working. Firstly, the payment of workers in developing countries is lower than in well-developed parts of the world. The difference in paying can be very significant. For example, last researches have shown that american worker employed by Apple company in the United States has twice as much  money as chineese worker has a month. Secondly, developed countries cannot often provide big areas for buildings where products can be produced.  However, many businessmen claim that they need to spend too much on transporting products produced in poor countries back to developed countries. Besides these products cand be harmed durin the flight.  Concluding, there is no one right view on the way of buisinessing and every company always chooses its own strategy. In my opinion, moving the production to developing country is reasonable.
