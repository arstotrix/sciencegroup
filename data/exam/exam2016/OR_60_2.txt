Air transport is one of the most harmful mean of air pollution and the raise of worldwide temperature. So, the controversial question whether it is necessary to reduce the usage of plane travel appears. It goes without saying that air transport is a leader in the sphere of convenience and speed. It is popular for both business and leisure travelling as busy people have a need to move fast around the world, and people going to have a rest et a widen range of places to go and discover. Moreover, airplanes provide possibilities to cheap travelling. Therefore such kind of transport can give an access to the easy mooving for different social groups. For instance, the new tendency, low cost companies, becomes more and more popular, as not everybody can afford to buy expensive tickets. It is worth saying that there are worse and much more dangerous things, causing air pollution and global warming. So, if people started to use environmental friendly scooters or bikes instead of cars, the impact of air travelling would not tend so awful. In addition to that, governments should rather pay attention to factories that produce gases, and make the filtration and clean system obligatory to settle. However it is ridiculous to deny that everything should stay in harmony. I mean that despite the fact that I consider law reduction of amount of air travel quite useless, there is a need to control this point. All in all, the policy towards the improvement of environment, air pollution state, etc., should include many aspects, not only law regulation of air transport.
