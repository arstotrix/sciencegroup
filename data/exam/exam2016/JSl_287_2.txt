There have always been considerable debates between different groups of people about what social networking sites should be primary used for. Someone thinks they are fro education. Other people consider that they are good facilities for spending leasure time. I am going to look both opinions and express my own one. On the one side, Facebook and Vkontakte are really usefull for educational process. It means that people are able to communicate fluently with other students through these sites. For example, if a group of students needs to do any project, they may discuss it and do it online in group charts using Vkontakte or Facebook. Moreover, there are a huge amount of virtual groups which allocate people who are interested in a particular subject so they may discuss and share relative topics in such online groups based in different social media. On the other side, some people argue that social networking sites are for relaxing as they have wide range of functions for that. For instance, users can download films. Listen music and so on. Besides, someone considers that only university rooms are for studying. It means that student should do any home tasks in groups only in university communicating directly with each others because online charts may lead to discussing extra topics which are not related to the task. All in all, I consider that social networking sites are primary for sharing with your friends. However, this sharing may include both sharing something what you know and would like to discuss with your friends just for fun and entertainment and also sharing some serious interesting information with society of online groups. I mean that sites like Vkontakte and Facebook are both for education and for spending leasure time.
