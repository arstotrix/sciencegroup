 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The information given demonstrates how  contributes of developed and developing countries and as of the whole world in renewable energy changed from 2006 to 2013. Data are provided in billion dollars.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It can be deduced from the graph that developed countries tend to invest in renewable energy more than developing. Namely, from 2006 to 2013 developed countries contributed double amount of money than developing countries did. The high peak of investments in developed countries is in 2011 and they reached the point of about 175. However, the biggest contribution of developing countries was made in 2012 and it was about 100 billion dollars.   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, the similar tendency is illustrated in the whole world. The investments increased steadily from 2006 to 2011 and after that started to decline. Speaking more detailed, in 2006 about 100 billion dollars were contributed to renewable energy, in 2011 the investments are at the highest point of 279 billion dollars and then they dropped to 214 in 2013.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, the number of investments  in renewable energy depends on the budget of the counries. Though increasing amount of money spent on this kind of energy can be  noticed during the period from 2006 to 2013, afterwards the ivestments started to reduce.
