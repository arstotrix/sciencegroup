As it been stated, air travel has a huge influence on air pollution and global warming, so governments said that they should introduce some new laws to protect nature by reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure. I am totally disagree with the possibility of closing air pathes for free travelling. Firstly, the amount of gases producing by cars in big cities is much bigger than pollution from planes according to any statistics. It is quite logical to fight air pollution by inventing eco-fuel, electric cars like Tesla or improving the underground. Huge plant have valuable influence of air clearance too. If they want to fight with global warming and air pollution reducing the amount of flight, it will make almost nothing useful to the main issue.

Secondly, I strongly believe, that some amount of money fhom the whole company goes to some kind of modern charity and new creation to protect our nature and Earth from disasters. Air companies mostly get money from travellers. If government close all the pathes in the air, people would choose new ways to travel. And all of that: buses, trains, ships â€“ needs fuel and electricity. And also no one promise, that people will wote go against government.

As a traveler myself, I strongly disagree with this position. I think that there are many ways to save the planet and keep people happy with the new lands. I'm sure, that taking control of water and air pollution and noticing the global warming is possible and government can make it correctly to protect everyone.
