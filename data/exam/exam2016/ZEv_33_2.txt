Travelling by plane is very popular way to move all around the world nowadays. It is very comfortable and really fast: with the help of air travel you can achieve your final destination in shorter period than you could do it about 100 years ago. But there is the other side of air travelling. Planes produce the pollution of the air and many other deseases like warming atmosphere. That is wht some scientists say that we need some rules introduced by government, which are connected with the airtravel in different purposes.
As for me, I think that global warming is one of the most important problems for humanity in the 21st century. Firstly, there are so huge amount of risks for people's health and lifes connected with the result of the global warming. For example, it is not a secret that global warming contributes such changes as coast lines movings and climate changes. So, as the airplanes have significant impact on this factor, governments should decline this risks by creating new laws for air companies and people who travel a lot. In my opinion, it will be very useful if our government install some amount brouds for travelers.
What is more, everyone knows that airports are never situated in the cities, but near them. One of the main reasons of this is that negative effect of airplanes is still one of the common dangers mentioned by specialists. Providing air pollution, air travelling should be more reasonable, I think. However, governments should be alarmed by this danger for people, animals and plants. It is in competention of governments to decline negative effect of air travelling by producing special laws to control air travelling.
In conclusion, I would like to underline that travelling by planes has it's dangerous effect on our health, for example, get lags make us feel bored and tired and crushes our biological watches. So, new rules and laws introduced by government are really needed today.
