How we know air travel could made problems with planetâ€™s air pollution, it could let to global warming. At this time scientist talk about this problem all time. But not only they, for example, Leonardo Di Caprio spoke about this theme, when he took the nomination. Does the government must introduce some laws for decide this problem? In my opinion, government must find a new faster transport for turism, when people can use it, number of people, who want use airplanes will decrease. I agree with opinion in this task, but I think that this problem can not solve only with new laws. Government must give some money for improve our engineer technologes. They could decrease danger and damage for our planet. It was on the one hand. But on the other hand people from our planet must conside the most nearest places from their home. In this situation they could travel by train or bus for example.  If government introduce this laws, they will must decrease number of traveler, it will not good for our tourism. People will not happy, because their travel will be limited. In my conclusion I can say, that the better way in this situation is to improve our engineeria. Because this way will give us move adventagers then in other way. We all must try to protect our planet and our world. Nowadays we must think about this problem.
