Besides, air travels are more faster and convenient. From the other hand, a wide using of air travels causes some problems with environment. A reducing of the number of flights is not the only way in solving that problem. Engineers and biologists should create some technologies, which can help make airplanes’ influence less dangerous.

Finally, in spite of a big amount of unnecessary flights, the number of air travels cannot be reduced. The reducing can cause some problems for businessmen or for other people, who decided to spend their holidays in another country. Environmental problems are very vital, but the humanity may find another way to solve them. That is an another case for a technological progress not to stop.
