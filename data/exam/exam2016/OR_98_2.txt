Almost everybody likes traveling. A lot of people do it by plain and do not consider that frequent flights can cause environmental damages. But others believe that plains are one of the main actors polluting the air. The last ones think they should be supported by legislative power. As for me, I do not think that government should protect the environment by introducing laws that will minimize the amount of air travel. Firstly, it must be mentioned that it will be unreasonable and irrational to bound the number of flights because this way of traveling is the most convinient one for today and there is no substitution to it. Secondly, the issue of conjunctions made by plane should be concentrated to the findings of the clearest fuel. In to my mind, governments should make contributions to that scientific field. Thirdly, these new laws may hurt basic human rights, such as transferring freedom, some business freedoms that will not be allowed to implement due to inability to reach the place of business. Despite the fact that some people think air travels are unnecessary and humanity could reduce the amount of them, I disagree with this statement. I personally believe that modern rational human being does not travel by air if he has no relevant necessity. Firstly, due to the high cost of air travels. Secondly, because number of air travels should not be changed to the reduction. To sum up, I think the question of minimizing of plains’ flights must be solved amicably and rationally. Inspite of the fact that plains’ wastes hurt the air, governments should not react radically by reducing the number of flights but try to reduce of every air travel.
