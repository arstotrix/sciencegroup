Nowadays there is a big problem with crime and the question of reducing crime is in the top. Some people believe that longer prison sentences can reduse crime, but others consider that there are more alternative ways of reducing crime. To my mind, the best way to reducing crime is phsycology work with criminals. First of all, when a person is in prison for a long time, he gets used for this place. All his frends are there and the in life prison becoms his life. So, if we give him longer rpison sentences, he will be happy. Moreover,the prisonÂ inhibits human and it becomes asocial. And if we want give crimes longer prison sentences , we could understand that it can give us irreversible consequences. On the other hand, if we do not want see crimes near us, we mustn't give them another chance, they need to have longer prison sentences. So, we are not animals, we are all people and we need to give chances to crimes. There are people - psycologists , who can help crimes become a normal people. I consider, that a normal people can not kill a person or do other people hurt.  All in all, so many people so many minds. I believe, that we must give people with mistakes a chance to correct their mistakes and start a new life.
