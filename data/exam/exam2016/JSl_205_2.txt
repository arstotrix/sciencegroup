Reducing crime is undoubtedly on of the most important tasks of our government. But what are the ways to do it and how effective they really are? Some people say that increasing prison sentences is the way to go. People who fear being locked up for a really long time are less likely to commit a crime, they say. This conclusion is fairly easy to come to, but is it really the most humane and effective way? Opposers of such notion say that it is not. As statistics show, many people who were in prison later commited another crime and got into the prisons again. This shows the current ways of sentencing people and working on them in prison are ineffective. Some people propose better psychological work on prisoners, and, later on, giving some help to former prisoners to make their path to normal life easier. Such help may consist of social adoption courses, giving education to people still in prisons, or, maybe, offering work to newly free citizens. As for me , I am closer to the second camp. Making people live in fear and ruining their whole lives due to one mistake may be too harsh. Also, less strict laws may also improve the situation. Recent decriminalization of all drugs in Portugal. For example, greatly reduced overdose count and drug gang activity, which in turn leads to better and happier population. To conclude, there exist several opinions on reducing crime, most of which are legitimate and possible ways to go, so the only possible way to decide is a democratic one, because of pros and cons of all of the ways.
