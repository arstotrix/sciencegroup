As the technologies are being developed every year, humanity has started to think about our planet. During the twenties century people destroyed enormous amount of natural areas, poisoned rivers and oceans, killed millions of animal. Today we are faced with consequences of our actions in the past, that is why environment measures are so popular nowadays. There is a point of view that because of harmfull effects of air travel like air pollution and global warming governments have to decrease air travelling for business and leisure I partly agree with this statement. There is no doubt that humanity must take care of our home, our planet human actions cased so many environmental problems, so reducing even only one of them will be beneficial for Earth. Air travelling is not harmless, killos of gases are bough to the atmosphere every day. Some countries are trying to use more environmental friendly fuel, but the rest can not afford it and continue to pollute air. It is obvious that by reducing the amount of flights we will pollute Earth less. Nevertheless, making laws against air travelling is not the only way to reduce pollution. New and more ecological fuel can help to solve this problem more effectivly. Even if air transport is used only for unnecessary needs, it still pollute the atmosphere. Humanity can not live without planes therefore we must make it more ecological. To sum up, I strongly believe that reducing air travelling will not sole the problem with pollution and global warming, it will only make people think that they are taking care of environment, to my mind possible solution is making new fuel for planes, which will not poison air.
