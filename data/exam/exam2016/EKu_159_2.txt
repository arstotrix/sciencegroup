Nowadays there is a widespread point of view that one of the possible solutions of an increased crime level is prolonging of prison sentences. However, other people provide a contrary opinion: they claim that it is not enough and other measures should be taken. This topic seems to me rather controversial, so it needs to be discussed. Arguments for both viewpoints are outlined below. To the one hand, longer prison sentence may be helpful, but only in the case when we are not speaking about the countries like Norway, where most of prisons may seem more comfortable than some old poor flats in Russia. For some lawbreakers 20 years (or even the rest of his or her life) in such prison would not be a punishment. It is doubtful, wheather life in prison where people are allowed to read books, sleep in clean cozy beds and go to a gym will decrease crime level.  To the other hand, if prison will be the the place which scares every killer and thief, and 20 years in it will seem a frightening future, this measure may work. Some people also belive that a good way to get rid of  murders and rape is a mortal punishment. It sounds a bit cruel, but makes sense if we are considering serious crimes.  Summing up, I am somewhere in between these two opinions. To my mind, prolonging of prison sentence is a good sollution, but only if it is combined with other measuers.
