Nowadays a lot of international corporations make their businesses in developing countries, due a job for local workers and employees and move their busines as well as it possible to poorer. I think this problem can house a lot of advantages as well as hove disadvantages. First of all, I would like to tell that there is no doubt that developing countries have a great potential and motivation to be a developed country in a future. It gues opportunities for companies to develop their business more quickly and popular in different parts of the world. Secondly, the bosses employ local workers who know about culture, traditions and the ways how developed an airsea brunch more succeed especially in their countries. Before 2013 turned, I had not knew about one corporation, which named Apple. They have a status and a lot of airseas brunches. In the last few years they move their business poorer and moved brunches in different developing countries, which help them earn a lot of money and raise the quanty and cost of their investments. However, some people think different. They strangles believe that business should not move away from their nature countries and employees must be the same. They guess that they need to save their unique. For example Japanese companies have the rules which are about the fact that they must employ only Japanese people, work only with their countryâ€™s standarts despite the fact that they work at the airsea brunch. Japanese corporations always save their unique and culture. In conclusion, taking  everything into consideration, I would like to share my opinion, I strongly believe that international companies must integrate in different countries, especially in developing employs local workers to learn something and make something new for our world and progress in different ways.
