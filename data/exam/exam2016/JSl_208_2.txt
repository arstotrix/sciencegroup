Nowadays the crime issue is one of the most trending problems in society. There are various policies that regulates crime level. Most popular way of reducing crime is to give longer prison sentences which is believed to be a harsh method.  In contrast to radical government policy there are several alternatives.

Moreover, for some people living in prison is a benefit, for example, the number of unemployed persons is rising due to qualification level. That is why such strict methods will achieve nothing in particular. From the other hand, government is able to regulate crime level by changing people’s way of thinking and providing more job and education opportunities for citizens. Because main reason for commiting a crime is lack of satisfaction from your current live condition. The other chance to lower the crime state is to slow criminals how to live “properly”. A perfect example is relation programmes aimed on employing. There are a lot of people commited a crime in inappropriate psychological education. For such person longevity of prison sentence is useless, because from this point of view he is unconscious. To sum up all reasons against such way of reducing crime level, each of criminals should be treated by individual method based on personal characteristics and history feedback.
