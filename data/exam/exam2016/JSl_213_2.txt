Nowadays a lot of people maintain idea that air travels pollute atmosphere and create a problem of global warming besides they think that the government must control the amount of air travel for business and leisure. As for as I am concerned government should stimulate companies to decrease air pollution, however government must not introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel. First of all, air planes as a transport and infrastructure create a new possibilities to world and local economies, so if government reduce the amount of air travel the gross domestic product decrease and social weltane become lower. Moreover, after reduction of air travels people change transport and start to use trains and buses, these increase a carbon dioxide emissions and create the same effect. And the last but not least, people should stimulate now technologies and not to kill them, so government must introduce laws to stimulate aircompanies using efficient planes. On the other hand, some people think that reduction of amount of air travel solve the problem of air pollution and global warming. However, I disagree with this point of view because there are a lot of another factors which influence on global warming. Besides, alternative transport which use green energy is law-developed at presented moment. According to the argument presented above I would like to say that government must not reduce the amount of air travel and should stimulate companies to create how technologies reducing air pollution.
