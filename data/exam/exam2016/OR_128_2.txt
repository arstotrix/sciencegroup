Over the last decades the problem of “parent and child” has received renewed interests by lots of people. It is known that progress can as well as improve our life as spoil it at the same time. So, with beginning of new era new problem borning. It can be called a most important one task to solve due to its original specifications. What things can be changed in order to do it? First of all, the step of determination have to be mentioned. It is widely known that child always pure. And if the problem exists in the family, it is parents guilt. No matter when the issue happened, parents someday made a mistake in their relation to child. So, the most effective way to solve the problem is to spent more time with their childrens. It is simple way on the first glass, but it is absolutely not easy to do. People should what is more valuate for them – their little creation or work. They have to remember that child has its own world and if parents will be outside this area, something really bad happens. Work and career is not a real being, it cant think and feel emotions, it doesn’t need someones love as childrens do. All the problems are solvable here. The second way, is suitable mostly for teenagers and grown-ups. They sometimes can be really angry and cold to their parents. After many years of silence and dealing with the issue their attention became much more bad. It is important to break the ice, forget and let go old situations. Clear view on their parents, understanding of their world, full of career, their own problems and meaning actions can solve problem in a neutral way. After this neutral level both parents and childrens have to go to a positive level. Remember some funny situations, they experienced together, or discuss some interesting for them themes. Taking everything into account, I therefore conclude that attention and care are two ways to sucess and solve this important problem.
