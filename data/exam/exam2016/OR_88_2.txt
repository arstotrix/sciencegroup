It goes without saying that nowadays the problem of air pollution and global warming has become a hot issue. In the light of this fact, a lot of people claim that air travel is a main source of such pollution and government should change the legislation to reduce business and leisure flights. As for me, I can not agree with this position. First of all, sometimes air travel is the only way to visit other country an it would be violent to make some restrictions, not allowing people to go abroad. Of course, there are another types of transport, for example, ships or trains. But in our world there are a lot of people who suffer from marine disaster or who cannot afford tickets. What is more, air flights are the fastest way to reach the destination. This factor is essential for business deals, because according to sociological reseaches, approximately 70% of business negotiations are international and they are held in different countries. So, the reduction of air travels for business will do a lot of harm to the economic and social spheres. However, the problem of pollution is much bigger than peopleâ€™s entertainment and business, this, governments should make some measures to prevent further pollion of the air. But I think that introducing laws to reduce the number of unnecessary flights will not be as effective as it is claimed. Nevertheless, governments can make laws that oblige air companies to reduce the amount of waste in the air or, if it is possible, to use another source of energy. In general, I would say that reducing or prohibiting leisure and business flights is not the solution for the problem. Government should try to find another ways to solve it without affecting economic, social or personal spheres.
