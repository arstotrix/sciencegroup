The issue of reducing crime and making society guarded better is one of the most popular problems which government of all countries are trying to solve. Many people believe that the best way to make amount of crimes less is to give longer prison sentences. I can agree with this statement due to several reasons. First of all, crime itself is a big sin because it is unfair to do bad things to other people. I believe that if a person who break the law has to pay for this and there would not be any exception. For instance, in Russia if a person kills someome he/she can be pisoned for only 10 years. I think, it is not an appropriate sentence and it must be prolonged. In addition, when a prisoner comes back in "normal" life, he can not normally live. It happens because he/she already has bad feautes and he/she can do a crime again. Also, other part of society can not trust  ex-prisoned people, therefore they have a problem to find a job, thus they can become bulglars due to a lack of money. On the other hand, some people believe that there are alternative ways of reducing crime. For instance, many of them organize some meetings to help ex-prisoners to cope with  return to a 'nornal' life. Some say that these meetings really help people to recover both mentally and physically after their life in prison. It is a pity that in the most of cases it does not help and ex-prosiners break the law again. To sum it up, there are more advantages in keeping law breakers longer in prison. It can be a really effective way to reduce crime and to make safety for society, because a lot of people who were in prison make crimes over and over again.
