We are given two bar charts – one compares usage of Facebook on different platforms over a year, and another shows main reasons of Facebook usage between genders. First of all, we can see that modern social network usage shifts toward mobile platforms. During the period of March 2012 to March 2013, number of desktop users decreased slightly – from around 150 millions to about 135 millions. On the other hand, amount of mobile users grew almost twice fold over that period – from just over 50 millions to almost 100 millions. Combining all of these numbers, we can also see that the popularity of Facebook still increases. Comparing gender Facebook usage patterns, we can see that men are not that different to women. Both sexes’ favorite pastime is sharing photos, and altruism, in form of finding out the ways to help others, is the least popular goal. All in all, we can say that mobile is the future of social networks such as Facebook, and photo sharing is very trendy in the current generation.
