In the whole world many companies which have “a daughters” in different states trend to move their producing to poor developing countries. This way to do business has different countries. This way to do business has different advantages and disadvantages for that countries and companies themselves. Firstly, the main advantage of moving factories to poorer countries is a cheap lokal workers. It is needless to say that a work hour of worker from Germany would be more expensive than a work hour of poor man from China fro example. What is more, for developing countries factories from Europe and America is a chance to rise up their national wealth. Often sharply for workers in that places higher than in the same national factories. Moreover, this movement is a brilliant example of globalization and dialogue of different cultures. Despite of the arguments in favour of advantages of the movement business to developing countries, this way has some disadvantages points. First of all, it is a step against national economies of developing countries. They haven’t any chance to develop their own businesses and factories in this situation. Secondly, often there are no human rights for local workers on that factories. It is violently for all the people to work so much. Last but not least, the production of this business is very expensive for developing countries despite of the integration and internationalization. Poor people in Asia and Africa simply can not allow themselves to buy Iphone, because they have no money for it. To summarize all the arguments, movement of business to developing countries has both advantages and disadvantages. On my point of view, disadvantages outweigh some advantages, because I believe that human rights and developing of poor states is more important than wealth of the richest companies in the world. I suppose the idea about national development, although the idea of movement factories to Asia has own place in the world business.
