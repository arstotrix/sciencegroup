Many people use air transport but they don’t think about damage which has this kind of transport. Air travel has a lot of advantages and disadvantages but mineses such as air pollution, global warming and others play main roles for life of society in our time.
I actually agree with this statement. For the First, oil which used in mechanism of air transport has different negative elements which changed nature and atmosphere of our planet. If people will use this oil many times they will have problems with nature which they can’nt solve in future.
Secondly, people develop a great amount ways of air travel. In the world about 3000 airoports and each other of them everyday fly down and fly up a great number of air transport. People who live near airoports and under air transport’s ways have more problems with health then people who don’t live in this areas. Many children and adults have respiratory problems. Also a noisy from this kind of transport damaged a nature and people’s health.
But the other hand for some areas and situations air transport is a one opportunity to live. If people don’t have this kind of transport people who live in Siberia or others places which don’t have ways for cars or ships. they cann’t lives in this areas Air transport give them foods, oil, doctors, clothes, medicaments and others really important things in our lifes. There are a lot of situations wit big car crashes where people need help right now. Air transport is a one ability to reach place of car crashes so fast and save people’s lifes.
To sum up, in some situations air transport can help people to solve their problems but I think that you shouldn’t use air transport if you have really good different ability to reach the aim so if you will use air transport many times it will give for the nature a lot of negative things then helps for you.
