It becomes a tendency for both parents to have a job these days. Consequently, their kids tend to spend less time with mothers and fathers. No doubt, with an increasing popularity of feminism, gender roles start to change. Women are no longer seen as people who are capable of childcare only. Nowadays, more and more of them can express themselves beside housekeeping. This is the reason for most kids to go to the kinder garden from early age. As a result, it’s not possible to spend with their mothers as much time as they did before. My family is an example for this statement: both of my parents decided to have a career, so my brother and I cherished every chance to have a vacation all together or simply go to the theatre in the evenings. Another reason is that in current economic state the only working parent is simple not enough to ‘feed’ the whole family. I order to let a father have more free time, his wife chooses to find a position in a company for herself. Then he doesn’t need to take on more responsibilities at his job. My uncle had had two jobs before my aunt started to send over her CV to a number of companies. Living in a big city costs a lot. It’s better to share some duties for parents to bear the burden together. In this situation, their children spend less time with them. This can cause such problems as not having enough time to develop a character in  your own child, giving away your own chance to raise a kid to someone else. For example, a lot of young girls are offered a position of mannies to help families look after children. There are some kindergardens that provide nighttime care for kids. Nothing can be compared to your own parents, the situations needs change.
