Some people believe that air travelling causes such ecological problems as air pollution and global warming and people should stop using it so much. Others have the opposite oppinion and think that humanity should not doing something the solve that problem.
One the one hand, it is really to do nothing when ecology becomes worse from year to year. There are a lot of organisations that try to safe our world from ecological disaster. They reduce level of bad effects of factories, conern about the harm of cars on air pollution, fight with deforistation. All in all, they try to use any opportunity to decrease the pollution and resist to other problems in terms of ecology. Millions of people travelling on the plane when sometimes it can ve fone by, for example, train. It is indoubtly that reducing the amount of air travelling will lead to significant positive changes in air pollution and preventing of global warming.
On the other hand, people use plane because it is really the fastest and most comfortable way to travel. And in conditions of our fast rhythm of life it is the only possible variant to see the world and not to spend on that much time. Moreover, most of the people have a really short time to leisure and it is really difficult to imagine holidays without plane. Of course, ecology defenders say not about the stopping using planes but they suggest to introduce laws that immediately will lead to increasing of prices. Furthermore, it is not the best news for people that like to travel.
In conclusion, of course, the situation that like to travel in the near future, because our world is too influenced by the possibility of travelling by plane. In my point of view, we should think about the methods of decreasing of air pollution and global warming but we should do it by using new technologies without falling of confinience of our life.
