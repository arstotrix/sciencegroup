We live in fast-moving world, where every day people commit different crimes. Governments of countries should devise different ways for decreasing level of crime. The first way is giving longer prison sentence. First of all, people will afraid a punishments because nobody want go to prison and sit there very long time. On another hand, government will waste a lot of money for prisoners every year and that not good for country. Money should allocate to education of medicine, but here that tendency will not work. The second way is alternative, for instance, government can do some job for prisoners, where they will work or own country and bring money. That is good idea, but have disadvantage. That is people will not afraid a punishments, so that mean in country increase level of crimes. That is not sound good. In my point of view, governments should connect these two ways of reducing crime. Because all people do mistakes in own life and among these people exist very good and bright people, which did crime for own good goals for instance, people need the huge sum of money on operation. Government should understand that and choose right way.
