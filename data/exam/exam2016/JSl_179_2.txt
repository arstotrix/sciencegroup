More and more people are concerned about the crime situation as well as the crime is increasing. Broadly speaking, the government and citizens consider that we should take action to prevent from crime problem. But, now should we take action? Some of people think that giving longer prison sentences is best way but I feel that there are better ways to reduce crimes which can give us more positive results. Firstly, the number of crimes increases in that countries in which the economical and social situation is most terrible. Often the poverty makes flavourable condition for new crime. Majority of citizens is not given an opportunities and prospects for living and surviving in the society. Some of them have to break law with aim for earning money. As result, the highest proportion of crimes belongs to poorest countries in which the governments do not take actions to solve economical and social problems. But on the other hand, some of crimes are not based on economical purposes. For instance, serial murders and corrupcy are crime issues for wealth countries as well as for poorest. So thatâ€™s why the governments  should give longer prison sentences for serious crimes. But at the same time they should reduce prison sentences for light crimes which do not pose a threat to the society. To sum up, the crime situation is not least serious problem as environment and poverty issues. In my opinion, we should take action together to reduce crime by not only prolonging sentences for serious crimes such prison as murders and corrupcy but improving social and economical conditions in the poorest countries and erasing inequities between rich and poor people.
