Travels by air can lead to big problems: such as pollution of the earth and global warming. Nowadays goverments try not to increase the number of some air trips, spesially business. To my mind it is right, but this idea do not mean that global problems, connected with the envinoment will be solved at all.
Goverment may use a lot of abilities to improve the enviroment of our planet, so working with air travels may help to solve a small part of ecology problems. More than that such aspect as air travel are not the most important one because nowadays there are a lot of different things wich stimulate the pollution all over the world.
To begin improve the place where people livem they should improve the things around such as turn off, the light in time don’t lose the waste on the street. In this way goverment will not deal with such problems as air pollution, because there are a lot of ecological problems, wich humans have.
More than that, goverment should improve air ecology system. Most of dangerous pollutions associated with the technical acvices wich will very harmfull for people around the world. So, if means that recycling of the waste takes a lot of time and has an awful effect, on our planet. So, first of all, goverment should introduce law to improve people’s attitude to our planet.
To sum up, I would like to say that pollution is a great problem and air pollution is most important one in this case. To my mind, first of all people living on air planet should take care about all aspects of ecology sistem, not only air pollution and global warming. In this case our enviroment will be saved and the role of goverment in this proces will increase.
