In today’s world many people are working and can not spend a lot of time with their children. Why is it happened? What are the main reasons for this? Some people believe that parents should more take care about their children although if they are busy. Several years ago parents spent more time with their children, especially mothers, because in traditional families man is working while woman take care for their children. Nowadays many families are not traditional, man and woman have got the same social position, status and role in family. Therefore, man and woman are working in the whole day job and therefore can not spend a lot of time with their children. Second reasons is lack of earning. Nowadays in many families woman can not sit in home and take care for children because in this situation family budget consist only from man earning and it is not enough for familie’s lifestyle. There are several solutions: pay more money for working people or change social mind about partnertn family. Obviously, first solution is not objective and hard doing because in state budget has not a lot of money for paying huge wages for all employment people. The second solution may helpful to tell people opt for spending more time with their children on global. In addition to that, many people can not be happy without parent’s cares. In conclusion to that, I should to notice that this problem of choice between work and family is very important. I hope that in the future many parents can spend more time with their children, because family is the main value in our life.
