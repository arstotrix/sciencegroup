Air travel has become a significant part of our contemprory world. Besides the enormous number of benefits, provided with that fact, there are still some drawbacks. The one is airplanes wastes, that pollute atmosphere and cause global warming.
One should not forget, that there are literally dozens of thousands of airplanes, which lift up and set down all over the world daily. Each of them burns fuel and therefore contributes wastes into the atmosphere. While being not heavy than air, these gases flow up and within tome being may cause Earth ozon shield destruction. That is why I strongly agree, that governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of wastes, but not the amount of air travel itself.
To my mind, the general restriction in number of air flights would not affect anything, but the flight price, which is not the ultimate goal. Nowadays, air flights is a necessity and by reducing its number government will only increase the demand and therefore its price.
It goes without a doubt, that the reduction of amount of waste itself will solve the problem. So there are basically two ways to make it work: air flights number reduction and innovative ecologically friendly fuel. The first one is not the option as it has just been concluded. That is why I believe that innovative fuel is the future of air travel. For instance, the air plane, flying on solar energy, is now being tested. Of course, that kind of plane does not pollute air anyhow.
To sum up, I do agree with a general point, that airplanes pollute air too much and the global warming is inevitable in this case. But at the same time I disagree with the measures, which are suggested.
