The graph illustrates how the investment in renewable energy in developed and developing countries changing from 2006 to 2013 and total world invest had been score. Overall, it is seen that in both countries of both first and third world investment had been growing since 2006 reached it peak in 2011 and then started to fall. Interesting, that there are some differences in dinamics of western and eastern countries, for example developed countries invest in 2009 less than in 2008, when in developing countries investment increased. Developed countries invest twicely more than developing but developing show more stable growth and doesn’t fall so dramatically. One more pattern, which is seen on the graph is that the difference in amounts of money invested in renewable energy between “rich” and “poor” countries is getting smaller: in 2006 investment of developed countries were more than twicely bigger and in 2013 eastern countries invest practically the same amount of money.
