The bar chart shows the number of children both male and female who do not have access to primary school education in Africa, South Asia and the rest of the world in 2000 and 2012. The main trend is that the number of children who do not attend primary school has declined. The sharpest dive can be seen in South Asia where the total numbers felt sharply from about 33 million to approximately 10 millions children. The chart also indicates that the number of girls who do not have access to primary school is higher than that of the boys. However, the situation became the opposite in South Asia and in the Rest of the world by 2012, where the number of male students without primary education is slightly higher (5,1 million compared to 4,8 million female students in South Asia and 7,7 versus 7,6 million in the rest of the world). Africa still remains to be the region where significant amount of children do not have access to primary education. Even though, the number of such children dropped by almost 11 million in 2012 it only reached the level of children illiterary of South Asia in 2000 and appeared to be almost 3 times bigger than the level of South Asia in 2012. Overall, the trend was negative during the period between 2000 and 2012 and the decline of number of children without education can be clearly traced.
