It is popularly believed that giving longer prison sentences can help to reduce the number of crimes committed and consider it the best way for solving the problem. However some people share the opinion that it is better to use alternative methods of reducing crimes rather than incresing the quantity of years of the imprisonment. Both viewpoints have their own arguments which make sense.  On the one hand, it can be useful to prolong prison sentences. This method is vied as a way to prevent more crimes and in some cases can prove to really efficient. And the logis is clear. Murders, for exaple, won't want to live in prison too long, so probably this perspective will prevent them from commiting crimes. On the other hand, there are alternative ways of reducing crimes. One of the way to solve the problem can be to increase the level of security. If there are more policemen everywhere, the citizens will have more chances to be saved in case of crime. Another way can be to inform people about self-protection methods. However it is more efficient to positevly influence the minds of peope in order to prevent negative thinking that leads  to committing crimes. In schools and by parents children should be informed about the amorality of crimes and about the fact that life is a right of every human beeing and that nobody can kill others.  To sum up, although giving longer sentences can help to reduce crimes, I strongly feel that there are other effective ways to do this like educating.
