Nowadays, almost everyone has ever tried to travel by plane this way of travelling became very common. However it contributes great harm to the nature, especially to air, that it is why some people believe that goverments should control the traffic of air travelling by special laws. I strongly agree with this point of view and in this essay I will explain why.

First of all, almost all modern scientists are very worried about ecological situation in the world. In order to save our planet many organizations try to control air pollution by different methods. In this case, it is important to use the power of government for helping our Earth. If governments introduce special laws, it will support ecological organizations in fighting with pollution and global warming very much.

Moreover, the main goal of the government is to care about people. In this case, it is try to make everything to provide more pure atmosphere and clean air. This changes will positively influence on the level of health and amount of births.

Finally, controlling the traffic of planes by government will show people the real situation in worldwide ecology system. Everyone will understand that this problem went to a new level â€“ level of the President. It will motivate people to be more careful: keep the air clean and do not make streets dirty.

To conclude, air pollution and global warming is one of the main issues of a modern society. In order to save the ecological situation governments should try any methods include introducing special laws for air-companies.
