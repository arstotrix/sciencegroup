It is well-known fact that while people fly on planes more the ecological problems become more serious. At the same time, the amount of air travels is constantly growing. Many people believe that government should make legal limits for leisure and business travel to cope with ecological problems. I am strongly agree with this opinion and will give some essential reasons in this essay.

Firstly, we are the only one who make the world for our children. It has been proven but many scientists and even international corporations that if we will not be more serious with ecological problems today, it will be impossible to live in this planet in near future. So, each of us should do something to save this planet.

Furthermore, travel limitation is important step to prevent air pollution and global warming and what is more important this step is possible to make today. Business air trips should be limited because in modern world there are many other way to deal with international business, like Skype-conference. Speaking about leisure travelings, here limitations could be made. But at the same time people need an opportunity to travel. So these limitations should be quite line for people, for example only once a year. Moreover, other ways of traveling should become cheaper at the same time.

To sum up, steps to save our planet and prevent air pollution and global warming need to be made right now and reduction of amount of leisure and business air travel with government limitation is one of these steps. So, in my personal opinion people should think about our planet and fly on planes less.
