There is no doubt that travelling by air has introduced many new perspectives for the mainkind and, consequently, brought more convenience in people’s lives. Nevertheless, nowadays many people are concerned about its impact on the environment and claim that air travelling should be restricted by introducing specific laws. However, I do not share this point of view for some reasons. First of all, the limitation of air travelling will not do that much to reduce air pollution, as it will still be used and the problem of global warming will still exist. To reach the effectiveness of these laws, the government should ban air travelling. Otherwise, the problem would not be solved and restricting the usage of planes, for instance, will not fail to contribute significantly to lowering the risk of global warming. Secondly, I disagree with the statement that lot of air travel is unnecessary. Due to the fact that planes tickets are expensive, people do not use the opportunity to buy them very often and usually prefer using trains, ships or ferries. Moreover, governmental restriction will be an interruption to the person’s right to travel freely that is not appropriate. Notwithstanding with these arguments, many people say that government should limit the usage of air travelling vehicles, as it should care about the environment and the citizens’ health condition, which can be worsened by air pollution. Nevertheless, it is debatable.
