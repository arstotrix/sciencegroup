The chart illustrates the number of boys and girls without access to primary school education from 2000 to 2012 in different regions of the world. In 2000 20 millions of boys and 23.7 millions of girls did not have access to primary school education in African region. By 2012 this number declined unsignificantly to 14.5 millions of boys and girls. In 2000 11.1 millions of boys and nearly twice more girls did not have access to primary school education in the countries of Sout Asia. In 2012 the number of boys without access to primary education reduced to 5.1 millions. The number of girls without access to primary education declined to 4.8 millions. South Asia region shows much more success in cutting the number of children without access to primary education in comparison with African region and the Rest of the World. Probably, the reason for this tendency is quality of policy in the field of Education provided by governments of South Asia region. In the Rest of the World number of children without access to primary school education decreased from 24 millions to 15 millions. To sum up, in all represented regions the number of children without access to primary school education in 2012 declined compare with that number in 2000, which is a positive tendency.
