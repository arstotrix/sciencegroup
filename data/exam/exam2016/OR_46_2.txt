As every educated human on Earth knows – the global warming is serious problem. It reflects negatively not only on human beings but on native plants and creatures. The main reason for global warming is carbon dioxide emission which is caused by oil burning in diffirent mechanical engines. These engines have planes, cars, motorcycles, rockets etc. It is visible things, so such organizations as “Green Peace” is already trying to do something. I am surely disagree with idea of reducing the amount of air travel both for business and leisure. It could help theoretically, but this restriction will strike on people. It would became hard to run a new international business or to continue the existed profitably. This means the only way out is science and alternative ways of making energy. Government should inrest in projects that are trying to invent an engine which does not emit carbon dioxide, for example, or give some scientists money who are working at gun energy based plane. It would defiretely help. The next thing is fossil fuels are not unlimited. The sum of gas, oil and coil is going down to zero. That makes sense. The last state in to make engines more fuel efficient. If we are not able to stop air pollution we will have to slow it down till new invents are found. To conclude, global warming is serious effect that affects every body. We should deal with it or it could kill human beings and wild animals or make them suffer.
