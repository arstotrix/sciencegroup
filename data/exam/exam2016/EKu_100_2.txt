There is a common thought that giving longer prison sentences is the best way to reduce crime. The other points of view are also taking place in our society.  From one point of view it might be helpful to prolong prison sentences. The statistics shows us that a large number of ex-prisoners returns to the criminal world after the sentence. It is also obvious that many killers have mental disorders which can not be cured. In this way we give freedom to the potential maniac.  From the other point of view there might be another ways to reduce crimes. It is not so obvious but prisons were created not for the punishment but fo helping people to change themselves. Such statement encourages society to invent more helpful ways to reduce crimes. For example it may be special courses at school. It is well-known fact that criminal addiction has been developing during the puberty. The other alternative way to reduce crimes is to stand high moral standards in the society. I want to say that only the criminal has an ability to stop the crime and the society only can help him.  To sum it up It is worth saying that alternative ways of reducing crimes could me more effective then prolonging prison sentences. First it is more effective to reduce criminal thoughts in the society then inflection on the real acts. If the only reason not to commit a crime is a long prison sentence it may be uneffective. Beeing in an unstable condition potential criminal could commit a crime and thoughts about the prison could not help him. The other disability of such way to reduce crimes is corruption. The criminal could prevent himself from the prison with the help of his money.
