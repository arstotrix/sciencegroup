Recently, a lot of international companies set their businesses in developing countries with poorer economic situation in order to employ local workers. Such trend has rather more benefits than disadvantages. Firstly, as for developing countries, where the business is moved to it’s citizens would start getting more and more work places. Such trend leads to people getting more money and wealth and as a result the quality of life in such countries grows along with the economy in total. Moreover, for the international company moving it’s business to developing and poor country means hiring cheaper labor force as people in such countries don’t make a lot of money. Such process results in company’s productivity and also the prices of the product might go down as the labor force is cheap and this is appears to be a significant advantage for the consumers. Furthermore it migh result in compary having more consumers. On the other hand, there is also a number of disadvantages of such process. First of all, it might lead to a new some kind of slavery. As the labor force in such countries is cheap and people know a little about they rights or there is even no low regulating the working hours and condition. As a result, the employer might make people long more hours which results of their health. In addition such process of moving business and factories to poorer countries reflects and distracts that country’s “natural” ways of development. For example, people stop doing agriculture, cultivating, farming and start to work on factories while developing agriculture could lead the country further. In conclusion, the proces of moving business to developing countries has both advantages and disadvantages. However, benefits of this development outweight the disadvantages.
