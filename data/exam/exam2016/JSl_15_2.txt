Nowadays there are a lot of reason of air pollution problem and global warming in the world. One of them is our travel. A plane is the most popular transport and people often use it for different reasons.  To protect air from this type of transport governments suggest to decrease the number of air travel for business and leisure. Traveling by plane is the fastest type of movement. People often go on holiday in other country by plane in other country by plane because it is the only way to visit a country which is far away. For example, if Russian people want to go to America they will not use a train or a bus because of a big distanation and ocean some people can say that people should travel in nearest places. Sometimes people need to use a plane because of work. It is necessary to reach a country as faster as it possible. There is no another solution of such situation people think that bisiness and leasure is not so important part of life because of it governments decide to reduce these types of traveling. In my opinion, people should travel by plane in any cases no matter bissines or something other. Nevertheless, one should consider problem from another angle. There are a lot of important factors where using of air travel is unnecessary. A plane is used when people need fast help. Foe example, it can be some medecine help for country which has sudden dangerous. In this situation people should not think about air pollution and global warming, they have to go for help immideatly. Taking everything into consideration, one can say that it is really important to protect air pollution. It is difficult to find a good solution of this problem. I do not agree with governments desision because I think that everyone who wants should use our travel.
