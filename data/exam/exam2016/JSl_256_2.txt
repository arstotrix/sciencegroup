Nowadays we have two largest social media like Facebook and Vkontakte. Some people think that the main purpose of these social media is to share knowledge and information with people. But others think that social media should entertain. On the one hand, in Facebook and Vkontakte people establish many different publics which depend on peopleâ€™s interests. Person, who wants to share or find useful information can search for a needed public with information he is looking for. Also, in social media there are many people, who share their reports about famous people, news, developments and etc. while other people can find these reports in Facebook and Vkontakte and get new knowledge about whatever they want. On the other hand, in our modern society every one has smartphone or computer. People who use these devices can play in different games on it. Many games on smartphones are connected to network and people can play with their friends from Facebook and Vkontakte. Moreover, these social media provides different publics with funny pictures, images as known as demotivators. People, who are tired after the hard day like to read comics which social media also provides and seeing funny images, vides. In conclusion, I would like to share my point of view. I think that people who say that main purpose of social media to share information and knowledge are agree, while entertaining is also useful purpose of social media/ so, people can find and read something new and get useful knowledge. Also, when they want to relax and have a fun, they can watch videos and find funny pictures.
