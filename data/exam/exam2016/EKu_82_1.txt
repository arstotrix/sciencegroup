The two given graphs illustrate a situation of using Facebook among men and women. The first graph shows the difference between devices used for the network in March 2012 amd March 2013, whereas the second bar chart embodies the main reasons for using Facebook considering the gender factor. It should be noted that the number of people of both genders using Facebook on a desktop is higher than those using their mobile phones (150 millions of people in March 2012 comparing to almost 60 millions of users). However, the situation has been changed by March 2013. The number of cell phones users has been increased for 40 millions of people. As for the reasons that people find most important to use Facebook demonstrated on the second chart, it is striking that receiving updates tends to be equally important for both men and women (39% of people). Although sharing photos or videos remains the main reason for users, women show more interest to this function of Facebook (54% comparing to 39% of men). The second in its importance reason is seeing funny posts, also looking more appealing to women than to men (43% of women and 35% of men). Finally, learning about ways to help others is on the forth place, still, a significant percent of women (35%) and men (25%) demonstrate interest to this reason.Â  To sum up everything, it shoud be said that the tendency of using networks (such as Facebook) via mobile phones seems to have been rising. Women prefer Facebook's opportunities of sharing photos/videos and seeing funny posts. Receiving updates appears to be important for both men and women.
