  Nowadays there are a lot of transports, which can help people travel, especially air travel. Some
people consider that it is very dangerous for environment and the government should establish laws 
against air travel. But othes disagree with it. 
  I agree with people, who think that air travel has more benefits than disadvanteges. On the one
hand, inspite of the fact that plains warm nature, it is the most fast kind of transports. In our
world time is valuable resurs, therefore air travel is very usuful for different business trip. 
Also, according to statistics, plains is the most safety transport. The goverment will save more
peoples life if they produce move plants. Moreover, usually people want to travel to travel to 
distant coners of the world and it will very long trip, if they use bus or train. If they use air 
travel, they do go to necessary place in short time.
  On the other hand, there are some disadvantages. For example, it is air pollution. However, if we
talk about all transports in the world, then we can see that each of it warm nature. All transports
produce different dangeous gases and it is harmful for environment and our health. Besides, 
nowadays air travel is very expensive. It is bad fact for families with low incomes.
  In conclusion, I want to say that there are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of air 
transport. Every  person chooses what he or she really prefer. However, air travel is important 
transport and the government should't establish laws, which don't let people to travel on plants.
