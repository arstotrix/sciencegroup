The use of social media has greatly influenced modern world society. What are the main purpose people use it for? Some people believe it is an effective tool for sharing valuable information, while others argue hat social networks are primarily for entertainment. I believe that social media can serve both aims. In my essay I will give examples for these 2 point of views. Most information which we can find in such social networks as Facebook and Vkontakte are mainly about hobbys, films, music. Also lots of social events, international and local news get widely coverage there. That means one who has account in such social media can easily get aware of any latest local and world community news, which is really comfortable and easy. It is a tool for many of us to keep up with newest friends in fashion, music and in many other areas. Moreover, social networks help to connect people with each other in their professional areas. People create professional communities groups where they share specific information devoted to career success and other topics. What is more, employees nowadays use facebook to find skilled workers for their firms simply by checking potential employerâ€™s profile. On the other hand, people believe that school media is not a reliable information source and can serve only fro entertainment. The reason for such viewpoint is that any people can write any kind of information in the Internet and indeed, this information is not necessarily correct. In addition, as a source of many entertainment services, such as online-cinemas and stream tv, free acess to music and journals, popular newspaper can seriously distract attention from work. People loose their concentration, which affects the resuit of work or study. In conclusion, the use of social networks have such benefits as gaining valuable information, but also influence people concentration and distract their attention. I believe, that we can combine.
