Nowadays, air travelling and planes are common things, but some people say that if there are unnecessary flights, governments have to reduce them to not to pollute the atmosphere and develope global warming. In this essay I will discuss this problem and give my own opinion on it.

As for me, I believe that we do not need to stop any flights. Firstly, modern technologies allow to build such planes which will not pollute the atmosphere so much and will not cause any negative effects like global warming.

Secondly, many flights are just necessary because of economical reasons. I suppose, none of modern air company would make their planes fly empty if it was economically wrong. However, there is another opinion. Some people think that if we stop unnecessary flight or reduce them: air travel for business and leisure, we will help the nature. It is their main argument.

Unfortunately, they do not think about problems which can occure if we do this. For example, if we reduce the amount of flights, we must be ready to develop other types of transport, because people do travelling and do much. This must be done to avoid transport collapse.
To conclude, I would like to say that there are some problems with air pollution and global warming, but we just need to develop our technologies to avoid it without making another problems in social mass.
