 Air travel has been proven to contribute greatly to air pollution and global warming. As a lot of air travel is unnecessary, governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure.
 I totaly desagree with the introduction f laws reducing the amount of air travel. There are some arguments for my point of view. 
 Firstly, air travel is the fastest type of transport and it gives an opportunity for people to go through long distances for people to go through long distances for the short time. That's not a secret that nowadays people frequently have a problem of lack of time, so the air travel can partually solve this problem. Secondly, some countries are located on other matericks so you can arrive there only by airplane or boat. However, the sea transport is less popular now than air transport. After all, why people have have invented the plane? I suppose not for the case that once it'll become the most popular mean of transport and someone make up his mind to introduce laws of reducing it. I'll give an example. As it's known, the path from Moscow to Vladivostok needs 7 days by train. 7 days!I think nobody can imagine that a business man will decline to waste so much time just to from one city to another. And finally, it can badly contribute to tourism. No one goes to the country that located far away by other types of transport. For istance, nobody goes to Australia if the air travel is illegal. 
 To sum up, I suppose that  ven introduction laws reducing amount of air travel  can not change people's preference to travel by air. This mean of transport has already become the popular one and it also will develop in the future.
