Business is an important part of our life. Many businessmen move their companies to a poorer countries, where they make working staff from local people. Some people believe that such a move can bring harm to a business or even destroy it. Others suppose that moving to a developing country can be a life time decision, which can help to make a fortune and be successful there. I agree with the second opinion, and I want to explain my thoughts on this subject. Firstly, international companies moving to other country can cut down expenditures on taxes, because mostly developing countries do not have high taxes.  Also, local workers usually are cheap, so company can spent money on it’s own development. Secondly, movement to developing countries gives a company a chance to take the lead on the local market, because if such a country is poorer so the company will not have a trouble contesting with other analoges. No doubt that the company will be the most successful in that area. However, there are people considering that movement to other country is a huge mistake. Then reckon that the movement can cause some troubles like problem with adoption to a new resources, new markets or even rules, so  that movement can lead to a company’s destroyment. I disagree, though, because changing for any company is a big step, and a wise director should think about all features and possible risks before. When all was said and done, I would like to stress that changing place for a company has more advantages than disadvantages but if the director do not make his best to make better success, the company will be in troubles, obviously.
