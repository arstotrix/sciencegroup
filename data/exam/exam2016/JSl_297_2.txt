Nowadays people believe that the main goal of social networking is to share information and to get an online education, but others say that it is only way to spend free time. There are lots of devises with internet connection and people spend many time in Internet. They pick up their phones everywhere they go. To share information by social media is an easy short way to inform your friends or schoolmates on time. For example, when I was studying o often asked hometask by Internet. Sometimes I tried to phone to my friends but their parents were at home and I need to speak with them first and than they give phone to my friend. On the one hand, we live in 21st century and there are comprehensive coverage of online seminars, different cources and online games to improve populations education or other skills. Now I am a second-year student of HSE and sometimes I have free time I’d like to listen online cources on courcera. I could recommend to listen such cources as “Introduction into microeconomics” or “Corporate finance” they are important for my future area. On the other hand, young population spend most of time in Internet not for education or sharing information. They prefer to see different comedy shows, films or play online games only to entertain. They underestimate that Internet could prevent them for studying. In conlcsuion, so many social websites make our communication easier but we shoul avoid playing online game and we must use it for education.
