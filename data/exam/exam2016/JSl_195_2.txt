Punishment for crimes significantly differ from country to country. Such difference is produces by controversial beliefe that longer cuprisonment sentences would lead to reduction of crime level. There are some arguments for and against, wich I try to explain. As my own opinion, I think both options are possible. To begin with, let’s take United States as an example, as recent studies shown, those, who commited a crime once, are more likely to do it once again, despite of punishment on threat of it. Based on this research some states entered the “tough” way of reducing crimes: for every next crime you get longer prison sentence, up to permanent for the third or fourth even insignificant crime. Indeed, this had reduced the crime levels, but possibly brought other drawbacks, such as making population more aggressive, wich may only exacerbate the problem. Another way of fighting crime is worth considering. Some people think that the key fighting violence is giving people proper education and bring up. Prisons should teach people do live in healthy society, rather than separate them from it. This caring, soft approach involves shorter prison sentences and comfortable living conditions in jail, along side with efforts do minimize any violence in society at all. In theory this should lead do less people become burglars, thiefs, murders, etc. in the first place and as a result, less budget spent on punishment facilities. To summarise, each method has its prospekts and consequences and may be applied in different situations. I think that different methods may be suitable for different countries. Though “soft approach” may be more desirable, it’s way more hard to bring into being and thus only suitable for highly organized society.
