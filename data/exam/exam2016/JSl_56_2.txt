Nowadays, we can see a tendention to have a businesses in the foreign countries. Some people believe that it improves cross-cultural communication between people. Others think that it is bad for national economy. Letâ€™s find some pros and cons of the issue. For my opinion, to have business out the country have a lot of advantages. Firstly, in poor countries the workers are vey cheap. The people in poor countries can do the same work as people in developed country, but with the less payment. So, you can have the maximum profit. Secondly, if you started business in the poor countries you can help people to live in the international world. You can give them a possibility to work. There is other side of the problem. If you started business in the other country your native country have no any profit. The national economy can decline. People in developed countries will not have a work. Such situation we could see in 2005 when developed countries like USA, Germany preferred to build their factories in the China. Chinese people had a job, and Chineese economy rised, but Germans and Americans no. To conclude, it wanna say that business in the developing countries is a good way for all world. It improves not only international community, but also helps people from developing countries to live in better condition.
