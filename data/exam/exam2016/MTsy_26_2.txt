Nowadays more and more people travel in the world. And the main way of transport which they choose is flight. Some people believe that such a way we polute our planet. Let us discuss some of negative and positive aspects of this view.
As for me, on the one hands I particular agree with the statement that air travel has some diadvantages. For example, firstly, plains pollute air by gases and a waste when they fly. It leads to difficult consequances with our health. We breath such air and get some illnesses such a way. Moreover, air pollution leads to that plants die and if the economy related to the sale of agriculture it may be effect on this country: it would become poor.
However, on the other hand, we cannot do without flights by plains because, for instance, some people have some family members in other countries whom they want to see and visit each other. Besides, some people fly by plain to work in other countries. Some of them have their business throughout. Such a way, they cannot find other ways to go to these places.
In conclusion, it should say that the amount of air travel for business and leisure should reduce. However, it is impossible to realise because we cannot limit people in their desire. Moreover, we should have connection with other countries because of getting knowledge of cultures, for example.
