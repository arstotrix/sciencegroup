There is an opinion that air travelling can have a negative influence on the situation that is related to air pollution, that is why this type of travelling should be reduce. Therefor, this essay will be about reducing air travel with the help of reproducing laws. That is why it’s necessary to discuss: will laws be really effective? First of all, it can be effective if the governments set up a law reducing air travelling, because in this essay it can be seen that the amount of air travellings will decrease and it is logical th people will become involved in the travel using trains or cars that are cheaper than air trips. Thereby, this political manipulation will help not only air situation but also traffic modernization. In addition, when there are some problems that are related with air pollution it will be a good idea to use the law, because it is one of the most powerful aspect. What is more, it has a category that is related to the justice and it is a kind of abligatory and rule that controls all citizens of the country. Thereby, there is a high possibility that introducing laws will be significant and effective. Overall, taking everything into account it can be say that setting up the law that will control air travels will be really useful , because there are two main reasons: firstly, all laws are obligatory for all people or a person will be punished. Furthermore, introducing the law on air trips, we will help not only the environment, but also involve people in “road” trips that are cheaper than air one. Personally, I absolutely agree that the government’s laws will be useful and I think that all these arguments have enough evidences to be truthful and they can have a place.
