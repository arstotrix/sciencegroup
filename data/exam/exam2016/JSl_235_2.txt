Pretty useless to state that planes are not harmful for environment. Although it makes sense to argue about degree of this phenomenon. Sa air transport is quite expensive (especially business classes) and frequently used by people, who should get to another far place in short period, it provide great taxes from avia companies, so it government issues a law reducing flights, then if should be ready to revenue lases. Moreover, this kind of laws can make a number of families to decline an idea of travelling (not only international flights, but domestic as well). People should take into account: what the air will be left to future generations? Will they able to take a breathe of fresh non-polluted air? Probably, if government does not introduce this law in nearest future then in a few years, decades or centuries one will not be able to go out without a special  mask or another air-cleaning device. These thought can really madden one. Nevertheless, I believe that government should not fight with air pollution using such methods. Instead of reducing the amount of flights, it would be rather better for everyone to take care of inventing new types of engines, planes or gas, which will be not so harmful.
