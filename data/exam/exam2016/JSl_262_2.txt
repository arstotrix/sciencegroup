The Internet and social networks particulary are becoming integral part of our lives. But different people have different points of view about the pure goal of using social media. Ones believe that social networks are aimed to information and knowledge sharing, others argue that it first of all just entertainment, in this essay I will look on both sides and provide own opinion. On the one side, first of all, the Internet was created as a place, where people have an opportunity to communicate and share information staying at different points of a world. Of course, social media now develop this idea and let people do it in easy and comfortable way. For example in such sites as Facebook or Vkontakte people can find and enter different interesting community where they will have a chance to communicate with people with the same interests of views. Secondly, social media is a place where people find and share any content that they want from scientific articles to documentary films. Take students as an example: they use social networks as a forum for discutions and bank of materials for studies. On the other side, social networks also play a role of entertainment for many people. It can be communicating with friends or different countries make friends and sometimes Internet frenship becomes more strong then alive. And of course social media represent a place where people can relax: read different stories and, funny pictures, listen to favorite music. For some people it seems a time wasting, but for others it is a chance to take a rest. All things are considered and I partly agree with both sides. I tend to believe that social networks: play multy-fanctional role and everyone decides, how he will rise it. From my point of view the best variant is to strike a balance between using the Internet for entertainment and information sharing.
