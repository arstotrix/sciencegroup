According to modern statistics and experience the amount of companies, which got into developing countries and fastion of employ local workers have been highly increased. There are a lot of advantages and disadvantages of these positions best I strongly believe that it is best that companies could do for developing countries. To begin with, the problem of unemployment in developing countries, such as Africa, is one of the main question among them. They do not have a lot of abilities or ways to get a well-paid job, so the idea that international companies gives solution to this problem to developing countries is great chance for local people to show what they could do. On the other hand, this step from big international companies may cause unpredictable consequences. Most of the people, which are living in developing countries do not have a high –level degree so they could do not understand a lot of things, which are essential to a company’s reputation. To sum up, it’s a great step from famous international companies to employ workers from developing countries, it is a great chance from people to try what they could do despite to all these things, such as lack of experience and a university’s degree. In my opinion everything depends on person’s will.
