Today, there is an era of Internet uses and network communications. There is a huge number of people who uses different social media. However, the purpose of these media is different for society. Some people argue that the social media should exist for additional information and knowledge that are shared by users. Others believe that the entertainment is the major purpose. As far as I am concerned, social media are relevant for the knowledge you are getting from the news, communities and so on. First of all, having information from the Internet can help you to from your background experience and make your own point of view on the life. In particular, watching useful applications and videos on the social media can support you in your daily life, study and work. Besides, getting the last news you are getting additional topics to discuss with your friends. It can be a helpful thing that will allow you to communicate with more people and to be on the same wave with them. Finally, it is a good way to share something useful with others and perhaps to meet new friends on the Internet. Nevertheless, gaining information from the social media can have a bad impact. Some people have a bad influence and can teach you something horrible. Moreover, some people tend to manipulate others and can easily abuse you un their purpose. In this case, the entertainment is the best option for social media uses. It is a great pleasure to relax after job and play some games on the Internet. Overall, it is up to everyone how to use social media and everyone sees his own purpose of it. Every purpose has both advantages and drawbacks.
