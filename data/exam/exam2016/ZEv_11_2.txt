Using air transport can lead to the high level of air pollution and can be a cause of global warming. Some people believe that a lot of travelling is unnecessary and the number of travel for business and leisure should be reduced by the government. Personally I do not suppose that it can be possible and in this essay it will be discussed why.

First of all banning some kinds of travelling and decreasing the number of flights can lead to many personal problems between people. This law can destroy a lot of private plans which are essential for somebody. For example, a woman has not seen her children who live in another country for many years because of the work. She finally has time now to visit them but there is not any flight and in addition she will not have an opportunity to do this later.

Certainly, such kind of personal situation is a drop in an ocean of problems which can be brought by air pollution and global warming. So I would recommend to reduce the amount of air travel until scientists wouldn't have invented some ecological alternative mean of air transport.

In conclusion, it is recommended to solve the problem of air pollution and global warming by inventing some ways to use an ecological transport but not reducing the amount of air travel. Because people, in general, will not be satisfied when some laws destroys their personal important plans. Moreover people would not enjoy their life without traveling and learning unfamiliar culture which also means a lot for international communications.
