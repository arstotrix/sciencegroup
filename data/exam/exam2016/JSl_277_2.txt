Social media now is something many people cannot live without. But purpose of using it? Some people believe that social websites are necessary to share some knowledge and spread information. However, others argue that it is another way of entertainment. In this essay I am going to discuss both points of view and give my own opinion. Primarely, I will present peopleâ€™s arguments in favour of that social media is the way to share information. Firstly, using social websites is cheap and simple in the modern conditions when technologies rule the world. It provides the possibility of cross-cultural communication and, of course, leads to the increase of knowledge at the local and international levels. Secondly, as the information is unlimited and the race it spreads is quite social media allow people know what happens all over the world. For example, a half of century age people could hardly know the news from the neighbour town but nowadays we are aware of the event and affairs. Then, there are some opinions that social websites are introduced only for having a good time. It is said that their users not interested in getting new knowledge. It can be true because many people tend to spend online free time and try to distract from the information given then at work. Moreover, there is an argument that information in social media like Facebook and Vkontakte can be wrong and there is no need for people to collect it. According to the statistics, many facts really turn to be online false. In conclusion, I should say that both points of view have their right to exist. Social media is a helpful method of sharing knowledge and information but it can be not used in the right way. I believe that having an account on such website will help both to share information and have a good time.
