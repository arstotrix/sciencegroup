Nowadays with the advent of internet a lot of time is devoted to social networks such as Twitter, 
Instagram, Facebook, Vkontakte and many others. There are two opinions on the issue of what is he main idea of those social network must they be informative or must they be a source of entertainment. Those points of view differ considerably and would be covered in this essay. The first point of view says that social networks should be informative and give people knowledge. These who support this viewpoint claim that those social networks must let people get educated on-line by receiving some extra information and knowledge they didnâ€™t know before. Another opinion on that issue is that social network must entertain people not teach them. It is widely known that most of those webpages such as Facebook and Vkontakte were created with and idea of quick chatting with your friends and sending pictures, videos and music to have a pleasant time with your friends even if they are for away from you. As for me, I think that social networks must both be informative and entertaining as they are now. Take Vkontakte as an example. There are a lot of groups in Vkontakte which content different informative from scientific public pages and groups on literature to groups with funny picture memes or different videos which aim to make people laugh. All these groups make Vkontakte a unique website where everyone can choose for himself whether to get knowledge or be entertained. To sum up it is very important to note that both of these viewpoints desire a chance to exist. However, only the combined idea of those two sides suits me most.
