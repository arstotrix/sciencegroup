In the 21 century the time is becoming more and more valuable resourses for people. That is why nowadays using planes is very popular way of travelling for everyone. but the issue of air travel is very controversial, because planes contribute greatly to air pollution. Let's consider its advantages and disadvanteges.

First of all, the most important benefit of air travel is reducing the time, which had been just wasted some decades ago. for example, it took weeks or even months to move to another continents, but now the same way takes only few hours. It is especially significant for businessmen, whose slogan is 'the time is the money'.

However, planes affect on the enviroment and leads to air pollution and global warming. The environmental damage is confirmed to be a danger for all human population. Nevertheless as for me, introducing laws limiting air travel for business or leisure has more cons then pros. fistly, it will be decreasing the pace of technical process and globalisation. Secondly, it may lead to corruption in the country because people will decide to buy the opportunity to travel by air unofficial.

In conclusion, I would like to say that air travel has become an essential part of modern world, and we cannon restrict it. Nevertheless, the problem of air pollution can be solved by developing of eco-technologies using governments' money as well as trans-national companies' money.
