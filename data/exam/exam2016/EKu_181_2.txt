Nowadays,the worldwide companies tend to expand their buisness moving it to poorer countries giving the job to local people. It is a controversal question which has its advantages and disadvantages.  First of all, the the invasion of huge companies provides aborigens with employment, frequently that means literally saving their lives, because in many poor countries people even starve to death without any resources to live, as they do not have an oppotrtunity to earn ther living. Hver, it is widely known that they are not payed a lot of money, because local oppeople usually are not well qualified.This causes a deterioration in quality of goods as the stuff is not well educated. There are a lot of examples which demonstrate that the bigger the conpeny is, the worse its production becomes. Secondly, the moving of buisness often demands building new plants, which may cause environmental problems as the area is polluted by te waste from the building process. There are a lot of cases when the innocent nature is destroyed by the big corporations, which may influence different areas, for example, tourism, which is a main source of income in many developping countriea as well as agricultture, which is clocely connected to the environment and can be influenced by the invasion of big companies.  In conclusion i would like to point out that moving of the buisness of international corporations may affect the local economics and environment both positively and negatively, not to mention the influence on the compeny as such.
