Airplane is one of the greatly construction with what every person can go anywhere and save his time.

In my opinion air travel are necessary for every person and without that we can't imagine our life.

Firstly, I agree with this topic in some part. Air pollution and global warming – this is one of the problems with what we can't do nothing. But goverements can introduce laws now to make airplane not proven to contribute to air pollution and global warming. 

One of the scientist from Moldova have an idea now to do air travels intresting and health. He gave his idea in USA and his idea was successfully. He make some scheme, now to travel with pleasure, but not just for buisness.

Secondly, I am not agree with this topic. Our life has many dangerous things what we met every day. Of course, goverement should control all these air travel, but risk and interest of life – this is something without what we can't imagine a person. If someone told you that you can go somewhere with plane just for a buisness, and of course you should show suggestion, for man this will be not good information. Because as we know every person is free and this idea will be not pleasent for him.

To sum up, air travel is something what is very popular in every country and without what we can't imagine our life. If the goverement introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for buisness and leisure, after that will be problem and people will not be satisfyed.
