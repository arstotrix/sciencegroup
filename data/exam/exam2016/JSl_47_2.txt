Scientificly proved that travelling by planes and helycopters may be one of the reason of global warming and air pollution. Governments have an opportunity to take care about this important question by regulating a number of different air transport. The degree of this control is a vital issue to be discussed. Initially, the trend of global warming, air pollution and other threatening changes in our environment are undoubtedly seen nowadays. That is why the modern society is faced with this problem and has to solve it as quickly as it possible. However, to my point of view, air travel causes not so many wastes and rubbish to influence the environment a lot. In comparison with other human wastes such as pollution caused by cars and factories, planes are not so bad. I also feel very strongly that any type of government regulating is a reason for decreasing of number of alternatives for peopleâ€™s choice. Introducing new laws is not only expensive for the society, but also killing for a desire of any human to make a choice and control his life. Eventually, I have to line up my answer. Air travelling is bad for our environment and this problem have to be solved, but we have to think about the costs of our regulation in this sphere. Much more effective way to reduce air rubbish and bad influence on the environment is to research this topic scientificly and make vital inventions. Introducing laws is only a short-term solution of a problem, which is also killing and difficult to be represented in life, as many people have to fly, have to change their location fast and cannot leave this opportunity.
