In the task I was given there a chart which shows changes in the amount of children without access to primary school education from 2000 to 2012 by gender and region in the world, especially in Africa, South Asia and the Rest of World. 
From the chart I can see that a number of boys and girls who didn't have access to get school education was 43,7 millions in Africa in 2000 year. After 12 years this number has been decreased and it was 32,7 millions of children without access. In the South Asia in 2000 this number of children was less than in Africa. There were 32,7 millions of children without access. By the 2012 this number highly decreased and there were only 9,9 young people without education. It is amazing that in 2000 in South Asia  an amount of girls without access to school was particular in a twice bigger than an amount of boys.
In the Rest of World there were 23,3 millions of children who cannot go to school in 2000 but in 2012 there were 15,3 millions without access.
To sum up I want to say that there is evalution of each country because each government try to give there children an education.
