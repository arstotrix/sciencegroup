On the graphs we can see changes of using Facebook from March 2012 to March 2013 and the main reasons for using it among men and women. The first diagram shows us that in March 2012 much more people used desktops to see their social pages – more than 140 million users and nearly 130 million people used phones. We can see that in March 2013 people did not like Facebook like before. Per cent of users was fall down. In March 2013 there are less than 60 million people used desktops and less than 100 users used mobiles. On the second diagram we see the main reasons for using Facebook. Women were more active users of Facebook, than men. Women like sharing photos or videos, seeing funny posts and learning ways to help others, men see that too, but much less. Only receiving updates men and women like both. In the end we can say, that users of Facebook are less with years and women are activity users than men in social nets.
