It is undoubtedly that people consider airplanes as the most concurrent and fast mode of travel. Regarding that airplanes produce of carbon emission which are damaging to the atmosphere, many people become worried about the great number of air travels happening everyday. I completely agree with those who are sure that governments have to take measures to shift to other means of travel when possible. Members of society often do not concerned about the role of air travel in air pollution so they have fights very frequently. If mass media warn the citizens about the consequences of air travel, people may make a shift to another mode of transport. Moreover, governments ought to introduce special laws and taxes on tickets, depending on the amount of carbon emissions produced. Raising the cost of air travel will defenetly have a significant impact on consumers furthermore, nowadays business trips are not as necessary as they were before modern tendances allow to communicate with a person from other side of the planet by Internet. Thus, firms can easily decrease the number of business travels of its employees. On the other hand, trains, cars, and ships also make harm to the environment. If all people will shift to these of travel, the volume of pollutive emission may even increase! So it is not sensible to use the less fast and convenient transport, as far as it produces pollution too. In addition, some people cannot travel by car or ship because of problems with health. Sometimes men and women want to spend the vacation for from home and, regarding the finite amount of time, travelling by plane cannot be placed by other means of transport.
