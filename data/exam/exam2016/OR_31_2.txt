Nowadays in the large part of families it is ordinary when children spend less time with their parents while they are not working due to age, rather they did in the past. Obviously, it can cause some different problems. However, the item in topic seems to be a mixed blessing, as there are many reasons for this point.
Firstly, when child grows up, he creates his own world, with self point of view, self sight in the things and of course, with his own people â€“ friends, and later, family. So, usually when both parents go out to work their children have their own families, or, at least, a partner. This item defines the following thing: our already not young child lives separated, in other words, far from his parents. This is the one reason. Secondly, also the obvious poin, is that when the child become older, some important things is appearing, such as education or job. This is why students or employees cannot spent a lot of time with close people, in particular, with their parents, because of general business. No need to say, it always causes problems. The first and the most dangerous if that old parents are staying alone. There are no one to help them with everyday issues, no one to care about them or, finally, to simply talk with them. So, old parent feel themselves lonely. The second problem is that because of spending less time with parents than in the past, children sometimes break good relationships between them and parents. Senior people see their falt in the lack of attention to their children, and for second one this is the main argument: they do not look well after them, and this is the root of all their life problems. Sad, but true. In conclusion it should be said, that everyone is free to choose their own way in life, and to choose, how to communicate with parents. But ethics rules warn us not to forget about our parents, because this is our first and most important family.
