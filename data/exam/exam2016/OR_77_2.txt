Air pollution, global warming are vital problem for modern society. Some people claim that government should implement laws to reduce the amount of air travel for leisure, business while others disagree with this statment. I disagree with this opinion and suppose that the authorities can take other measures for solving this problem. Firstly, everyone has a right to move and travel in own country and abroad, choosing comfortable type of transport. If governments introduce laws, which limit the amount of air train they deprove population ability to use their rights. For instance, if person has meetings or deal in different country and there is not much time, she/he will use airplane, unless he or she can lost a job. Moreover, there are a lot of places, which are isolated, and the only way to get there is airplanes. For example, people, who live in Alaska, could not use train, bus to visit other towns for buying medicament, food, clothes. However, air travel creates a huge amount of fossil fuels emissions which lead to global warming, air pollution. Nevertheless, the authorities can tackle this problem, using other ways such as to create technologies with solar energy, bring up population to take care after environment or introduce special taxes and then invest money to environmental programmes, take part in International organisations. All things considered, I strongly believe that the government should not pass laws to cut the amount of air travel for business and leisure, because there are other solutions to resolve this problem without limitation of human rights to travel.
