The provided charts describe the change of trends in Facebook usage from 2012 to 2013. 

The first bar chart demonstrates the notable increase in mobile users of the platform, which jumped up by about 40 million, or more than 60 per cent. The change is accompanies by an ever-so-slight decrease in the users of desktop version, which, although constituting 20 million, is less than 10 per cent. Overall, the rise in mobile usage seems to be about twice the fall in desktop users.

The thing to immediately note about the second graph is smaller numbers for 2013 across the board. The biggest hit in being considered a major activity on facebook, which is what the graph shows, is taken by media sharing, dropping from 54% to 39%, by only a little less than a third. The importance of funny posts suffered as well; taken down to 35% from 43%, it is now in third place, from the second. The value of receiving updates, though, holds: staying at 39%, but now at the first place from the third. The final thing to notice is that discovering new ways to help others wasn't nearly at the top, and continues to fall in popularity.
