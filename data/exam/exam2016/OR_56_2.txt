Nowadays there are more and more people who travel by planes, helicopters and other tipes of air transport. The atmosphere is polluted and the tempeture of Earth increase slowly. Some people say that the government should decrease the number of air travel for job and rest by lows. I am partly agree with this opinion. First of all, there are people for whom it is nessucary to travel a lot. For example, if someone live in America and have busines parters in Russia, with whom it is important to meet face-to-face, he cannot reduce the amount of flights. If the government decide to decrease the number of air travel they can lose their jobs. The second reason is that government can find alternative ways to solute this problem. The can invest money for producing of an ecology oil. They can also set buildings for cleaning air in their countries. But there are cases, when people can travell less then the do in now. By statistics, rich people travel by planes and helicopters more often then those who have not got so much richies. If governments introduce laws to reduce the number  of air travel, they will start use trains to move from one place to another. If people have a lot of time they will use transport, that less pollutes an air. To sum up, government can introduce lows against the hie amount of air travel for business and leisure but there are some other ways to decide the problem of air pollution.
