It is chart shows changes in the number of children without access to primary school education. I am summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and making comparisons where relevant. If looking in the chart then we vision what boys and girls in the 2012 years going to school very few, then in the 2000 years. And this very good. I think, what in the modern world children must have study in school (before in colleges or university) and this chart agree with me. In the 2012 years children without access to primary education have a less in 10-50% at the 2000 years. In the Africa this ~10%, in the South Asia this ~70% and Rest of World ~15-20%. In South Asia very big changes: in the 2000 years girls without access to primary school education 21.6 millions and in the 2012 years 4.8 millions. 16.8 millions only girls study in primary school and I think that this awesome. In the final my esse Iâ€™d like said what modern world take care about children and we should to fun it is.
