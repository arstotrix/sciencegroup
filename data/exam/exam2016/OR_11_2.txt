In modern condition the problem of ecology is strongly important, that is why the humanity seeks different ways to reduce the damage influence of the Earth from our everyday life. As we knoe, aircrafts make a contribution in air pollution and global warming. One of possible ways to solve this problem is decreasing the amount of air travel for business and leisure by using a law. However, I do not encourage this approach. At first, the air transport is the one of the popular, safety and fast king of transport. Nowadays, humanity can not to find appropriate substitution for it. For instance, it is impossible to remove on anather materic without air, if between couple of places are ocean.
At second, there are more effective methods to stop the process of global warming and air pollution. As we know, scientist of all world working to research alternative ways of energy instead of air ang gas, that unisng such as fuel for, cars. It is evidence, that car using more common millions of cars and influence more greater to ecology than all aircraft , that exist on the planet, if fly simultaneously. 
To conclude, to win air and global warming, the humanity should to reduce directions, that introduce the main distribution to ruin the nature, but not small details.
