Increasing prison sentences is the best opportunity to reduce the number of crimes. And while one way group of people including me agree with this statement, the other prefer to think that we can use better variants . first of all, it is the obvious fact that if people who broke the law more time in prison, they will not do again what they have people have done longer. For example, government look for killers and does not give them the chance to kill anyone. Another way why longer prison sentences is good is that many prisons give these people opportunity to help society while the are there. For instance, law breakers can clean streets, make clothes or cook. So, rising of prison sentence means that they will help us longer and with this they can return something for their bad things. On the other hand, if people have not done anything illegal but they have been charged by mistakes for someone, they will have to stay longer inside the prison because of the increasing sentences. In my opinion, we have to increase prison sentences, so peopled will pay for killing people or other illegal things that they have done. And thaks to that people will afraid to break the law because they will fear to waste so many time in prison. To conclude, if we will increase prison sentences we definitely reduce crime and help society more but some people who have not broke may suffer longer.
