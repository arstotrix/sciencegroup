It is no doubt that pollution is one of the global problems now which should be done in nearest decades. For this reason air pollution has the same impact on our society as a part of the whole issue. In the same time we should carefully choose what air travels to reduce. To begin with, almost all people can visit airport or its site to see the influence of airplanes on our environment. This problem is critical to our society and some measures and improvments have been done, but some advantages are not used widely by all firms in this economic sphere. Consequently, authorities should first of all reduce the harm of air transport using current results of the development of knowledge and science and not shorten the volume of the air industry. At the same time air transport is very young comparising with rail, car or water methods of travelling. So that when government will try to cure the environment by restricting the industry it should start with leisure part. In this way, the society will not lose positive effects of the development of business which in future also can be changed toward right working system. To conclude, I would like to say that authorities have a lot of intensions to solve described problem in nearest future, but hopefully polliticians will come together with a right set of measures which will cooperate and will create an environment friendly industry.
