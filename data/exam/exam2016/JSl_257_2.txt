Nowadays, a lot of people spend much time using such social networks as Facebook and Vkontakte. Some people believe that the main purpose of these networks should be to share information, while others consider that it should be on entertainment part. Both of these points of view has their advantages. First of all, social media like Facebook and Vkontakte has a lot of users, it is a great opportunity to use these networks to share information. You can post information about the event, science invent, celebration day or else and enmourse amount of people will now about this by sharing this post.   Secondly, such social media at present has a lot of Entertainment groups and “publics” as they called in Vkontakte. Mainly, such groups don’t have an interesting information, they just have finny jokes and pictures called “memes”. These groups are really popular because people spend all the time working and studing and when they “need a rest they just have a small break and scroll their newsfeed to read some posts”. To my mind, the main purpose of these social media is the opportunities to stay in contact with your friends at any time. Furthermore, the second purpose is both the entertainment and the share of information, because now people don’t want to make choice they want everything in one time. Having evaluated everything mentioned above, I can confirm that both points of view has their positive sides, however, the contact with friends is much obvious purpose of the social media.
