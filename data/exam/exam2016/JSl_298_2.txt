In modern world the majority of people use social networks for different purposes. Some to share information, while others for entertaing. Both of these features have its own advantages and disadvantages. Facebook and Vkontakte are the main social media web-sites that are used by lots of students over the whole world.

Lots of spam and pop-up pages disturb users from reading the information they need. Users need to pay attention to what they read and to whom they share knowledge. Of course, there are not only drawbacks of sharing information and knowledge in Facebook or VK. Getting the information becomes much easier. Users can upload their essays or homeworks and post them on the wall, so their friends will be able to check it and help. Many newspapers have official pages, where they post hotnews. It enables users, who are subscribed, to be the first who read the news. Although, Facebook and Vkontakte have lots of information for sending, it also has entertaining content, such as music, films and games. This content gives a chance to users to spend time playing games with your friends or watching new film with family. However, the majority of music and films, uploaded to these web-sites are usually pirate. This means that it’s illegal to use the entertaining content due to authority rights. The social network Vkontakte was sued for “pirate” music and films and asked to pay 14 million dollars to singers or producers.
