I agree that air travel is one of the reasons of air pollution and global warming. So I think governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. To my mind it is easier to find alternative ways of how to travel then to solve a problem of global pollution. Governments, for example, can make better and wider structure of train transportation or to make better roads for cars and buses. Another way is to make such transport cheaper for people. I think not all people will be happy to lost their appotunity to fly by plane easily but such changes can make the situation better. Also I think that it is nessesary to educate people abut the global situation of pollution and warming so maybe then they will accept such laws. Of course from the other point of view it is very unconvinient to go by bus, or by train to some places. If you need to get from Russia to Africa and need to do it very fast of course you won’t think about pollution and will want just to get there faster in any possible ways. For example if you need to visit your ill parents but they live far away of course you will better fly by plane. One of the good thing about this low is that if people cant often fly by plane the will choose not such far away places to visit and will explore some interesting local places they didn’t so before. I think in whole it is good way to stop air pollution but people will be not happy to reduce that. Government should create very good alternative ways of transportation.
