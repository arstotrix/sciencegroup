How to reduce the crime rates? This is very important issue in modern world. There only many opinions about the ways of solving this problem. Some people think that the best solution is to make prison sentences longer, other guess that government should improve cultural life of people, and this will solve the problem. Personally, I think that government should care about the teenagers in order to reduce bad influence from other people, but increasing prison sentences should be long enough. On the one hand, too much time in prison for people who did not, for example, a murder, is not good because all prisoners are people too, and they also should have rights. On the other hand, if prison sentences were very long people would avoid prison and they would do less crimes. But unfortunately, there are people, who do not accept other peoplesâ€™ living rules and this is really a big problem. As far as I am concerned, the only solution of this is to develop culture and promote science as activity among teenagers. Then, people will think different and be more directed to do special work.
