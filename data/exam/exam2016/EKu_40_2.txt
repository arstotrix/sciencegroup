Majority of people believes that the best way to reduce crime is to give longer prison sentences. Others are of the opinion that alternative ways of reducing crime are better and will be more effective. First of all, spending a long time in prison privides an oppotunity for the prison services to rehabilitate a prisoner. I think someone who has committed a serious offence will need a long time in a prison to be sure that a prisoner can be changed.  By contrast, some people argue that there are better alternatives than longer prison sentences such as educational programs and community services. The community service gives oppotunity to give something good to society, and it will change characters of prisoners.  In my opinion, goverment should focus on alternative methods and on resources on the the causes of crime. It is important to think about alternative methods.  To conclude, a balance between a long time in a prison and alternative methods should be control by goverment. It is hoped that felony rates will be decreased in the coming years and world will become a safer place to live in.
