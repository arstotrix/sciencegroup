In 2008 it stopped going up and remained  in the same level  until 2009.What could be interesting is that developing countries started investing more and in 2009 developing countries invested 68 $ Bn compered to 100 $ Bn invested by developed countries. From 2009 to 2011 the amount of money invested in renewable energy had been rapidly increasing and it picked in 2011 with investment of 279 $ Bn and developed countries spent twice as much as developing which also could be a tendency in this graph. In 2011 it started going into decline.During the period from 2011 to 2013 the amount of money decreased and in 2013 it was 214 $ Bn which is still more than it was in 2006.
