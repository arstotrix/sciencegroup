In the modern world there are a lot of international companies which are mostly work in the developed countries. However, through the years more and more companies want to work in developing countries and this wish has its pros and cons that I want to discuss. To begin with, this decision of the companies can have a positive impact such as the fact that more local people can find work, because it is a well-known fact that there is a big unemployment in the countries. In contrast, it can cause some big problems, for instance, it will prevent local business from developing. What is more, international corpoations have their own culture that an be unfamiliar to the locals and they will need a lot of time to incorporate into it. For example, if u were an African girl, I think I would look like savage for the international workers. It is because local people are not familiar with some unwritten rules such as dress-code. In addition, the presence of he big corporations can influence changes in the cities and towns, so they can become more modern and there would be more infrastructure. Unfortunately, it can lead to some obvious problems like air and water pollution. What is more, such development of cities can destroy the specific way of life that people are used to and what is more important it can cause the death of some endangered species. To conclude, I think that if international companies move in developing countries it will cause more problems than profits. It will not only destroy specific areas and kill animals but it will also destroy specific cultures and ways of life. I am sure that such actions can not be positive.
