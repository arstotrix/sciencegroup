Nowadays all people and government thin about problems without pollution and global warming. There are many facilities that causes them. And one kind of this ficilities is transport of air travel. And one of the solution of this problem is to reduce the amount of unnecessary travel, for example, for business and leisure. On the one hand, it seems to be suitable solution of problem without air pollution and global warming. There are a lot of unnecessary flights, for example, travels for business and leisure for not long distance. For example worker can reach the necessary city by train instead of by plane. And in this case introducing laws of reduce the amount of air travel is an excellent solution to save our environment. On the other hand, there are many places which are in long distances. And achieving them by train or by car require many days. In the same time we can achieve them by plane in some hours. Many people do not have so much time to spend it on travelling. Also there are many people that can not stand travelling by car or by train. They prefer to travel by plane. Also if we reduce the amount of air travel, it changes traffic on roads, more cars will be on road, and as we know cars also have bad influence on environment. And in this case this solution not seems to be appropriate solution. To sum up, introducing laws that will reduce the  amount of air travel is not the excellent way to solve problem with air pollution and global warming. It will be better to find some another ways, for example, such as finding some technologies that will reduce the influence on environment by transports of air travelling.
