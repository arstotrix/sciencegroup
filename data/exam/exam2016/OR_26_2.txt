Over the last 10 years travel has become extremely popular worldwide (in our country). And is now and integral part of modern society and everyday life. It is unanimously acknowledge that many travel proven to contribute. I disagree with this opinion. My opinion finds a sister and my mother and grandfather support. There mind is very important for me. A lot of people think the same way I do. Everybody loves travels. During they traveling they relax and can fun. And they whetewere they like they don’t think about contribute and global warming. 
Instead, I believe that travel it is good for children because they should be guided to the night path and not pushed. But some people think that they can see bed thinks, for example pollution or contribute greatly. This opinion finds my grandmother support becourse she denjeors to fly by plant.
In conclusion taking into account all examples I’am inclined to believe that travel should not be proven to contribute greatly and air pollution. And I think people must fly, becourse it is very interesting. And travel for business and leisure is very important.
