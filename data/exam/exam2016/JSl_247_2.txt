In the modern society air travels are considers as a typical element of everyday life of people. Some of us uses it business purpose, another part exploit planes during leisure trip but it is a fact that this type of transport pollute air and some people suppose that it  is better to reduce the number of flights. Every coin has two sides and this issue has both advantages and disadvantages, that’s why I partly agree with those who support the idea about flight restriction. It is undeniable that planes are very useful for the main part of people all over the world. First of all, this type of transport saves a lot of time because of speed. This time can be spent on important activities and to make one’s life better. Moreover, according to some researches conducted by special laboratories, planes are the most safe transport from those which are available to the majority of people. On the other hand, air travels implies extra air pollution and have a bad influence on the process of society development. In this case, the amount of gases produced by air transport is higher than by cars or trains and it requires a lot of efforts to correct this situation. So, the decrease in planes usage will lead to decrease a spending on the maintain of environment situation and in the amount of money that citizens have to pay as a taxes. Secondly, not every environmental problem can be solved easily should think about future generations. To conclusion it can be said that considered issue is very controversial and the possible solution has positive and negative features but I suppose that the trend of using planes will remain in the future.
