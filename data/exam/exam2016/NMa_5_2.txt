In recent years people have become of ecological problems such as air pollution and global warming. Some students have also proven that air travel is unnecessary, because nowadays there are often options. By saying this I mean railways and roads. However, these ways of travelling should become accessible to every citizen so more and more people will use them insread of travelling by airplane.
Secondly, there is another reason why people should not travel by plane and it is safety of travel. There has been a lot of researches carried out to state that air travel is one of the most dangerous ways of travel, if not the retual least safe. Even though for cars, for example, situation is about the same, trains are considered safe and water transport too.
Hawever, facts stoled above do not undo the understanding of another one. Air travelling is proven to be the most convenient, as plains allow us to reach any country we want, regardless of the borders or territorial difficulties like mountains.
All in all, people should take care of nature and the environment more than they care about themselves as a person. In other words time saved on comfortable conditions undo the damage to ecology caused by aur travelling. And that is why the amount of air travel should be reduced.
