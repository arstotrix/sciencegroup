In modern world quite a lot of big companies open their producing centers in developing countries and enhance local people as workers. And at the time when enterprises take good advantages from it, I must say that their profits are not as important as problems cause by this policy, and in my essay below I’ll try to prove it. First of all I should say that when some companies opens its factories in areas where people never used to meet modern ways of manufacturing, this interrupt their lifestyle and pace of life, so local people become more stressed at the same time as their believes also get endangered, because different producing types have their basis in different values, so managers try to change local employees view of life. It is the same as people who work in fields can not understand urban people and rice versa. On the other hand, enterprises do not only have a great profit from cheap local workers and create new jobs, but though the fiscal system supply government with money so they can improve social services. But as for me, it’s only western type of thinking that government should help and control us, we do not have to force other nations. All in all, in this essay I described some advantages and disadvantages of enterprises open their business in other countries at the time when there are different pluses of this. I believe that other positions being disturbed is much more important problem comparing to the profits.
