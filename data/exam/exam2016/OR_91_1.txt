The chart represents the changes of amount of children without access to primary school education over the period from 2000 till 2012 in different areas of the world: Africa, South Asia, Rest of World accordingly. There are some ideas about necessarity to have an education in different cultures for both males and females, and this chart shows it very clearly. To start with, the most number of children without access to primary education live in Africa (it peacked at about 45 million of children). And this decreased slowly for the period from 2000 to 2012 and become 32 millions, but both girls and boys do not have an access. Small changes happened in Rest of the World, but there is more positive indicators: only 12.8 and 10.5 millions of girls and boys were without education in 2000. And this number decreased sharply and remain only 7.6 and 7.7 millions according to the chart. In the contrary, in 2000 in South Asia there was a great number of uneducated children, but this one decreased significantly and reached the bottom (4.8 millions of girls and 5.1 millions of boys accordingly). To sum up, the same number of girls and boys do not have an access to primary education in these regions, except South Asia in 2000. And fortunately, situation with the access to education changed in all countries over the period and the greatest results are in South Asia.
