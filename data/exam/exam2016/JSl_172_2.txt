At the present it is becomming very popular for international companies transfer their businesses to developing countries and here workers there. Some people think that this method has a positive influence on both: companies and poor countries other people believe that it is completely useless and unperspective. From the one side, there are plenty of advantages in this new way how to manage things. Firstly, for companies it means cheap working force. So, this method can save their money. For example, in such countries like Africa people will agree to work for a small amount of money or even for feed. However, in America people will demand for a stable monthly payment. Secondly, this may give people in poor countries a chance for a better life. For example, for on their salaries they can buy necessary things for their needs such as food, clothes and so on. So, this method helps poor countries to develop and to live in a proper conditions. However, some people believe that the thing that companies move their businesses else where has only negative sides one of them is that, in this case, many people from developed countries have no work to do, because companies prefer hiring levels in developing countries instead of them. For example, a father of 4 kinds can not find the work on his spenarty,  because the only company that provides such services that he can do moves its business to Asia. To sum up, in my opinion the thing that companies move their businesses to poor countries has much more benefits, that drawbacks. Firstly, it is usefull for companies themselves because it will generally affect on their budget. Secondly, this way of managing will definitely improve the quality of life of people, who are living in the developing countries.
