The information given illustrates the amount of investment in renewable energy given by two types of countries such as developed and developing countries from 2006 to 2013, and it also shows, in comparison, the amount of investment as a world total over similar period. It can be deduced from the graph that investments that were done in developed countries remained considerably higher than investments in developing countries from 2006 to 2013. Moreover, the amout of investments increased significantly from about 75 billions in 2006 to approximately 170 billions in 2001 demonstrating nearly free-time growth. However, it should be said that after this increase the amount fell down to approximately 120 billions. The amount of investment in developing countries fluctuated; however, it tripled from about 30 billion in 2006 to approximately 90 in 2013. Overall, it can be stated that the amount of investments in renewable energy in developed and developing countries went up during this period of time from about 75 to 120 and from 30 to approximately 90 respectively. Moreover,this increase is similar to the changing in the amount of investment as a world total.
