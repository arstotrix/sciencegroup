It is generally agreed that the most effective way to defer crimes is to judge prisoners more strictly. Nevertheless, many people agrel that there are better approaches to punishment. It can be argued that longer sentences isolate criminals and, consequently, do not let them commit new crimes. Apparently, many murders and robbers tend to neglect law and repeat their murders and robberies. For instance, there was serial killer in the USA, who attempted to kill a family just after lies sentence had finished. Hence, longer limitations restrict such infamous people. Having said that, the criminal will have carried his burden to one day anyway, so this solution does not guarantee constant safety. On the other hand, many people are in favour of the idea that capital punishment or obligatory jobs re more appropliate. The former is the most effective way to get rid of the most violent killers. Obviously, after the death penalty new crimes are impossible. Although seemingly beneficial for society, it is worth nothing that the approach is in human and entalls new murders. The other debatable option is to let some people be punishes by monitory activities.  The reason for it is simple: the government will not allocate money for prisons. Moreover, there will be additional saved funds from criminals free labor force. Talking everything into account, I deem the second option is feasible. In case the repeated crime is inevilable, it is better to either, completely reduce its probability to get financial profits. Of two evils choose the besser.
