We see three chart groups in all years. It is Africa chart group, South Asia chart group and Rest of World chart Group. On them show changed how much access childrens in schools was been in 2000 and 2012 years. In all chart groups we see how less numbers access choldrens in 2012 year like 2000 year. And then we see in Africa chart group and Rest of World in all years the girls was been a lot like boys, but in South Asia chart group the boys numbers was been move like girls in 2012 year. So, in al groups we can see how fallen in school numbers of access childrens and then we see how numbers of girls was been more like girls in a more part of chart groups.
