It is common knowledge that air travel has experienced a rise at the beginning of the 21 century. A lot of people throughout the world have got the opportunity to more to distant lands on purpose and for pleasure in considerably little time. However, some of them air travel for being unnecessary and, however, harmful to the environment. The solution proposed by these critics comprises actions. Afterforemed by governments, such as changing laws in order to prevent people from using planet as a means of transport. As for me and my point of view, I would like to disagree with the both of the statement completely. First, contrary to a popular belief, planet do not contribute so greatly to the problem of global warming. What is more harmful to the environment, it that some countries ( like China) show no progress in trying to reduce the level of pollution caused by industries like metallurgy. Secondly and finally, modern say plane manufactures try hard to create a kind of aircraft with little impact on the environment. Speaking about the necessity to perform governmental actions , I would state that this will even worsten the situation. Proven by many economists and other scientists (like Ronald Coase, for instance), these actions may lead to resources (especially income and wealth) being allocated not optimally. To sum up, I would state that we should find other ways to fight global warming than forbidding air travel.
