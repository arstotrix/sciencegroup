Air travel has been taken to air pollution and global warming is born. I agree with the reasons, that the government should make laws to reduce differences between business and leisure. 
First of all, it could be said, that global warming one of the main problems in the world. And air travel could be issues, which made this problem the pollutions from airs destroyed the ozone’s layer. For example, war’s airs with something guns could bends in the air and dangerous pollutions are get into atmosphere and ozone’s layer to become more and more. Next, air travel for business and leisure have a difference between each other. Governments should introduce a special laws, which will be different for business and leisure. Business air travel to do more often, for example, because ony people need to fly very often for their work. As for leisure air travel, I can advanced people to use different transports, if it possible. This solution help a little bit to save some atmosphere zones. Government should make different transports more comfortable for a long trip. In conclusion, the any air travel has been proven to contribute to air pollution one of main issue any people to save our planet and government is the main helper every citizen. Special laws about air travels could help us to save ozone’s layer and stopping a global warm.
