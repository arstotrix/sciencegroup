The ways of reducing crime was always a hot topic in the society. While some people consider long sentences to be the solution, others insist that there are more efficient ways to achieve same goals. This essay will analyze both points of view and give supporting reasons. Putting a person a jail is one of the oldest ways of punishing law- breakers and it is still widely used in many countries of the world. A lot of people think that longer sentences would prevent others to commit new crimes because they would have to spend the rest of their life in prison. Nevertheless, there is a study which shows that there is no strong  correlation between length of sentences and level of crime. Mostly, it is happening because there are a lot of other reasons of crime like level of unemployment, low quantity of life and lack of education. That is why people started to reconsider their approach to reducing crime level. Evidently, it requires complex improvement pf citizens life. First, government should create more job opportunities so people could find a legal way to earn a better living. Second, teachers at schools should carefully explain the reasons why children must not bypass the law. Finally, authorities could spend more money on police force to prevent crime in the beginning. Despite the fact that longer prison sentences could slightly reduce level of crime, I believe there are better solution for that problem which are already apllied in some countries and they are showing much higher efficiency, and I hope they would be integrate worldwide in the nearest future, which would benefit the society.
