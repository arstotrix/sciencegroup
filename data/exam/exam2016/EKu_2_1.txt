The graph shows amounts of money invested in renewable energy in years 2006 to 2013, exhibiting those in developed and developing countries and also the sum of these two. Basically, throughout the whole period figures for developed countries are higher than those for developing ones. The trends for developed countries and world total are very similar to each other. They exhibit growth until 2011, and afterwards it begins to decline. First of all, in the beginning of the period all three graphs show a steady rise, improving from 100 to 171 billion dollars by 2008. After that, while the figures for developing countries continue to rise, the numbers for developed countries fall a little, so that the overall trend almost levels out: in years 2008-2009 it becomes lower by $2 Bln. But for some reason it experiences a massive surge in years 2009-2011, peaking at $279 Bln; both developed and developing countries show a rise in this period. After that, almost as quickly as it rose, the total begins to fall, reaching $214 Bln in 2013, an so does the investment for developed countries. Developing ones show a non-contrastive peak in 2012 and then begin to decline steadily as well.
