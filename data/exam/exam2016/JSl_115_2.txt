Today business is developing fast. Often appears new companies and businessmen. There is a big amount of international business too. We can see, that they have a tendency to move their business to developing countries. Of course, this tend has many benefits and drawbacks. I strongly believe, that the process of moving businesses to poorer places has more positive sides. It helps to improve their economics and gives an opportunity to local workers. First of all, it helps to improve economics of poor countries. Developed business can go abroad and make economic situation better. It helps to fight against unemployment, for example. Businessman developed other countryâ€™s economics, he may produce something or use natural resources. It helps because of lack of the money in the government. They could not do anything until they have not enough money. In this situation comes foreign businessman and help he government of poor country to remedy the situation. What is more, international business gives a huge amount of opportunities for local people. He gives them work and get cheap workers. They, in their turn, get new skills, which they can easily develop and new knowledges, which help them to work on better occupation. Moreover, they can get more money, because foreign business pay high salaries for them. However, other people claim that such business do not help to develop economics in their native country, all money from it is going abroad. Businessmen d onot pay taxes and so on. But they forget about one important aspect. I tend to believe, that it helps to make political situation better for both sides. International companies can help to build strong communication between developed and developing countries and it can lead to the union. Finally, I should say that there are more advantages in moving businesses to poorer countries. It helps to develop economics, political relationships and to give opportunities to local workers.
