But some people don’t agree and some people think that governments should introduce the laws to reduce the amount of air travel for by issues and leasure. Let’s start by considering the fact. Firstly, we live in the world in which people communicate with each other and people from different country try to find good opportunity for their business and some times they visit another country by plane. On the other hand there are a lot of tourists which want to visit beautiful country. And we can observe that approximately 4000000000 people travel every year. Let’s imagine if about 3000000000 people travel by plane how many air pollution plains contribute. It is big problem. We should safe the planet because several decade ago our earth didn’t have problem like that. Fisrt of all governments should introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leasure have traveled and noticed that a lot of chairs were free and there is one more task for government. They must tell people how air travel influence on the Earth. People don’t know about it. We should change it. In conclusion, I want to say that people forget to protect and safe our Earth.
