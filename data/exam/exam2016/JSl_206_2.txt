Crime is a serious problem in today’s world, and it is becoming more and more dangerous. While many people think it is best for the society to send people to prison for longer times. Others believe there are better and more effective ways to deal with crime. Giving criminals longer sentences is a good measure. Firstly, a long sentence will prevent many people thinking about communitting a crime from actually doing it. Secondly, the longer the longer a person spends in pirson after breaking the law, the more they are able to rehabilitate, to think, and to learn to become a law – abiding citizen after being released. On the other side, people say, that harsh prison conditions and spending time with other prisoners can do even more harm to a criminal. Good alternative are probation and community service. They let a criminal life in a normal society and interact with people whole being observed and controlled. In addition to this, there may be some measures for government to prevent crime by building a safer environment. In my opinion, introducing large prison sentences is not good enough, as it has been happening in many countries all over the global, while crime rates are rapidly growing. Obviously, while long sentences up to life should remain a punishment for the most dangerous falonies it is important that we seek other ways of reducing crime and waking world safer place to live. To sum up, inclear whether lengthier sentences are an effective measure to reduce crime, as there are good  argument both in favour and against them. This leaves a necessity for the governments to research do what is best to protect their citizens.
