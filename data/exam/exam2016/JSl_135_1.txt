The diagram provide information about amount of investment in Renewable 
Energy in a world total and particularly in developed and developing countries. The main trend which is obvious from the picture is growth of investment worldwide from 2006 with 100$ bn to 2011 with 279$ bn. The spentiture then decreased by 214$ bn in 2013. The bar chart, which is situated on the bottom part of the picture shows differs between investment in developed and developing countries. It is clear from the graph that developing countries spend less money on renewable energy than developed countries. however it is shown that decrease of investment in developing countries was not so dramatical and consisted only approximately 10 $ bn from 2011 to 2013. Summarizing the information from the graph it can be say, that developed countries need renewable energy more, than developing ones, so they spend more money for that. 2011 year was the most successful for the renewable energy industry and now it is hard to predict the willing trends. It can only be predicted that gap between investment in developed and developing countries will be smaller than before because of constructing new technologies.
