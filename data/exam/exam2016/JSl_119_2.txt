In the modern world, where the globalization takes place, lots of international companies share their businesses with countries which are poor and developing. It allows locals become a part of an international firm. In my opinion, I agree that advantages outweigh in this situation. Firstly, moving your business partly to a country where itâ€™s needed helps local people to get employed if they are not or looking for a new job with better conditions and salaries. Secondly, such a great idea like sharing business with countries must be very helpful for poor and developing ones. For instance, it will change the economic  development and will make life conditionals much better by bringing there new technologies and work places. Thirdly, this type of progress may be an example of cross-cultural development. What I mean is that in every society and country business has its own rules and features, and giving jobs to locals allows to show how other countries make business decision and the staff like that. Nevertheless, there also exist some disadvantages which maybe are not too serious and big, but it need to be noticed. I can see troubles in running business in another country while you are not there. Nobody knows how a company will develop without the main boss there who established his business and brought the main idea of development. To sum it up, summarizing all information which I mentioned, it is possible to say the troubles could be overcomed.
