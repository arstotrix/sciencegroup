From 2006 to 2011 there was a tendency of a gradual increase in the amount of money invested. A little fall in the year 2009 of the investments in renewable energy in developed countries caused the same fall in the total world spending (from 171 to 168 billion dollars), while the amount of investments in developing countries was still growing up.
