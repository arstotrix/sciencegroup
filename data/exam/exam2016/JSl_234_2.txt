As we all known, appears many environmental problems in the last decades. The most significant are air pollution, global warming and lack of clear water. Governments of the major countries can cooperate and introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel, which to their mind causes some of this issues. To my mind, it is not usefull measure to stop damage our nature. First of all, airplanes the most convenient and the fastest type of transport. A huge amount of people every day travel with air for business and leasure. Therefore by cutting the amount f air travel people will not use their kind of transport, they will conflict with the head of the orgnisations, that introduce new rules. Secondly, science develop new type of fuel. Nowadays, there are only for cars, but maybe in the nearest future researchers will allows for airplaines too. In this case, government can introduce a law bying this fuel by transport companies and use it  everywhere in the world. A lot of environmental problems exist because of not only one factor air travelling but also another â€“ cars, rubbish etc. government should summarize the whole activities, which causes this decreases and cope with some of them in way not to disturb a normal life of people but to contribute to air pollution and other great problems.
