Nowadays air travelling is one of the most common ways of travelling. However, it is known that air travelling can contribute to the pollution of air and global warming. As a result some people think that world’s government should write laws reducing the amount of air travel for business and leisure. I personally disagree with this idea. In my opinion, air travelling is not the toughest thing for the atmosphere. For example, it is well-known that the amount of CO2 which excessive amounts of sheep and goats produce is much larger than humans do. That is dangerous. Secondly, air travelling can not be reduced because people will just loose money – pilots, cabin crews and even those who fly for business meetings. For example, my brother flies from Moscow to Dubai 3 times a week, because that is his job. He earns money to support our family and himself. If most of the flight are canceled; then he would not be able to earn money. Other people say that air travelling is very dangerous because of the air pollution it gives the planet. They suppose that by minimizing air travelling it would be possible to save the planet. I love nature and would love to make the world better, I still think that air travelling is not the most harmful thing on Earth, compared with vast amounts of waste, for example. In conclusion, it can be said that air travelling takes a huge part of human’s lifes which means that it is impossible to simply cut down the number of flights and planes. There has to be made a complex decision, which can fight against the problem of pollution.
