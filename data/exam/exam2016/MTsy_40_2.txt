Nowadays, there is an opinion that governments should control travels by plans because of their harmful influence on the atmosphere and our enviroment. I cannot completely agree with this statement and in this essay will be examined reasons why air travels are necessary.
Firstly, there are no doubts that plans are fastest and safest kind of transports. For instance, the distance between Moscow and Paris takes nearly 5 days by train. At the same time plan needs some hours to get the same point. This transport saves time and makes people’s lives easier. Moreover, the official statistics consider that accidents among airplants happen rarer than with other transports.
secondly, globalisation requires to follow a high temp of life. Businessmen should make trips too often keeping their companies profitable. Besides, majority of life’s spheres relate to global business therefore issues in this area can led to reducing of the life level. There are different cases than huge transport accidents were a cause of problems in the cities or even countries.
The last but not least reason why air travels should not be controled is existence of other sources of pollution which are more dangerous. There are amounts of manufactures which influence air and global warming more harmful than gas of airplans. I strongly believe that goverment should pay attention to pollution from earth transports and manufactures because their negative influence is well-known and does not bring usility like plans.
In conclusion, I consider that nowadays society cannot exist in the normal way without airplans. It is essential part of its life. Besides, goverment has an opportunity to reduce global warming and air pollution introducing laws in other spheres of society’ life.
