Moving industries to developing and poor countries became trend nowadays. And, of course, as anything in our world it has both advantages and disadvantages. Talking about disadvantages and advantages of this – firstly we need to choose for whom will we check it. From one hand, we can observe situation with eyes of owners of business. For them, of course, moving company to poor country is  a big advantage. First advantage – lower payments. Now workers are from poor country and will accept work even for food. Second advantage – environmental pollution bills. In developed countries industries, wich produce poisonous and toxic stuff for environmental, should pay big bills to government. In developing countries they can close eyes on that, because they need it. Developing countries need such industries, because sometimes they don’t have money to start it’s own – and it is the third advantage for owners, they can dictate their own rules. From another hand, we have situation, observed with eyes of people, who live in such countries. Their environment is being destroyed, and they get some extra small amount of money for all the damage they get. Therefore, they need these money. By getting more money – country, may be, will try to get free of industry – slavery, but it wil be like this, it culture of small countries won’t be destroyed to that moment. Industries gave a big influence on culture of place, where they locate. So people may even forget their native language and start talking on industry language. There are, of course, and advantages for both industries move money, but poor countries are being developed, people get job, sometimes they also provide education or something like this. As the conclusion, I want to say, that we live in cruel world. If you are weak – the strong one will try to dominate you. Bur do you love or hate domination – everybody choose it for himself.
