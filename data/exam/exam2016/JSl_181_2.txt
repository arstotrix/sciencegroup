How can we get rid of criminal? Some people say that if perpetrators are forsed to spend more time in prison, the crime rates will decrease, while others tend to disagree and believe that prisons do not help in reducing crime at all. Long prison sentences may not  be effective in changing the criminals way of thinking, but t least they keep the traitors away from normal people for a long time. Such practice is already applied in some countries such as the United States, where one easily spend the rest of his or her life in jail, even if this one performed just one murder or robbery. You could see such ridiculously strict penalties consequences in movies like “The Shawshank Redemption” where an inmate who was found quilty while being a youngster was set free only when he became an old man. He couldn’t integrate to the new society after release and as a result committed suicide. The bad news is that after such a long time spend in a jail one not usually start a new life from a scratch. The system leaves criminals little else to do but committing crimes again. On the other hand, methods other than jail proved better efficiency in changing perpetrators’ behavior, especially the ones who committed a crime accidentially. These methods are applied in many European countries such as Norway, where jail cells look like expensive hotel rooms, and the staff is generous and doesn’t use violence as a form of control. I also read that some non-profit organizations move some prisoners who behaved well from a usual jail to an apartment just before release. These organizations also try to find a job these ex-criminals, enhancing their integration to socium. And this form of reducing crime looks the most appealing to me. Unfortunately, these organizations do not work in Russia. Here, without a doubt, it will take a long time to reform the ways of punishment. Our officials still think that good jail is still the perfect way to fight crime. And I don’t like this tendency much.
