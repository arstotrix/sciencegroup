Air pollution and global warming are the problems which air travel has been proven to contribute. Nowadays these two problems are becoming more and more popular. Lets analyze this statement. First of all, the governments must introduce laws to reduce the amount of air travel for business and leisure. In Russia there are special organisations which fight with air pollution and global warming (for example, the Greenpeace). They make conditions for struggle with these problems (demonstrations, other active methods). Secondly, in my opinion, people from different countries try to combine efforts to cope with the presented problems. Th process of globalisation is the best way to it. Thirdly, air travel can be reduced by using other types of transport such as trains, buses, ships and soor. To my mind, the government should install the time which business and install the time which business and leisure can use air travel. The experience shows that if we donâ€™t pay necessary attention on these problems, the catastrophe will be come on. To sum up, based on aforementioned argument it can be concluded that the better laws the better regulation. People (businessmen, at first) must save the nature with special methods.
