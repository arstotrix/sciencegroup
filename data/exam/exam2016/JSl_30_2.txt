Problem of  transport pollution is very actual nowadays because people travel more and more year by year. Air travel in Russia is not very popular, because of high prices for tickets compare with train. But in Europe and USA people can fly every week: to see family in other city, work trip, go abroad for a weekend. For domestic airlines typical, when plane fly with half or 2/3 of free space. And because if this situation there is very high fuel people rate. On one hand, % of all trips male by plane is still small cars burn much more gasoline every day and pollute atmosphere. But on the other cars, trains and ships have better fuel, person rate, so it is more efficient way of burning fuel. Thatâ€™s why I think that government really ned to invent new taxes. For air pollution or quotes for airline companies like: if plane fly with less 2/3 people on boards, company must decline it or pay attentional sum of money (it can take it from passengers). From position of airlines we can argue that: air market is not very high profitable, attentional taxes will decrease amount of passengers and increase price of tickets. Plane will fly with more free space and become more less efficient than now. To sum up, taxes and restoictions always very controversal, but nowadays with all our environmental problems and increasing amount f fuel burning every year, we need to think about future and try to spend nature resources more carefully and smart.
