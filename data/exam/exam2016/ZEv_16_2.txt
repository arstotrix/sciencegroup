It is believed that travelling by plane causes the rise of temperature and pollutes the atmosphere, so governments should control the number of usual trips, such as business and vacation ones.
It is agreed that humanity can reduce the injection of gases into the air by reducing the number of flights. This essay will discuss the arm of air travelling for environment, followed by a reasoned conclusion.
Air transport can be dangerous for our planet because even a one plane produces a huge amount of unlikely gases during the flight. It could be less harmful in case there were less air trips made. For example, according to the statistics, the quantity of travelling by plane increases at a forced rate-nearly 20 per year. However, there can be people, who strongly believe that the car pollution, for instance, threats more to our world.
Next arguments is that the Volume of bad substances made by one plane is considerably higher than the same of any other kind of transport. This outcome is connected with its size and in addition with the fuel used for such machines. For instance, it is proven that one plane produces pollution, which is nearly 10 times as big as comes from a dozen of autos.
Although, someone has an opinion that despite the fact of overwhelming air pollution, travelling by plane is the most convinient way to get to an another town or city.
To sum up, the plane produces a significant amount of harmful gases per one flight and the rocketing trend of using it can soon lead to the temperature increase all over the world. However, it is predicted that our leaders from various countries will unite and find a proper solution, for such insurmountable obstacle, like restricting the laws in this field or finding an alternative way of quick travelling, which will not have such terrible causes.
