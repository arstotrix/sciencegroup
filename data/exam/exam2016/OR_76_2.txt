In the last years, air transport became very popular and attractive way of travelling. A lot of people all over the world use it every day, however excessive use of this kind of transport brings some damages to nature. However, I do not agree with an idea that governments should introduce legislation in order to lessen the number of air trips. In this essay I will support my opinion. First of all, in comparison with another kinds of transport, planes seem to be less harmful. Let's take into consideration some water transport which require much more time to overcome the same distance as planes. As a result of long movement, water transport affect nature more badly. What is more, travelling by air has a lot of advantages, for example it is very comfortable, fast and, according to the British statistics, safe. For this reason government cannot limit the right to a free movement, because it is impossible to define if the trip is unnecessary or not. As for disabled people, we cannot make them choose other option because of the condition of their health. However, this question has an opposite site. Many people maintain the idea of introduction special laws which may restrict and decline the number of air transportation. Their main argument is that air travel influence nature negatively. To sum up, the question about weak and strangth sides of air travel is really very disputable. But I am still in favor of the idea not to introduce laws which may limit peopleâ€™ rights. As for negatives to climate and nature, governments should take measures in order to defend it using more effective ways.
