There are two points of view about the major aim of social networks such as Vkotakte and Facebook. One group of people support the idea of sharing information and knowledge throw that websites, others think that it’s much better to use social media recourses mainly for entertainment and relaxion. There are several explanation for both of that point of thinking. If we are talking about those who consider Facebook and Vkontakte as informative recourses – they are right. Those websites have a lot of public pages and groups of different themas. For example, there are a lot of blogs about cooking where you can find here dish and its recipe. What is more, there are some oficial public pages of newspapers and TV channels that also post last breaking news. Others, who think that the social networks is just for fun and entertainment, link such kind of opinion with possibilities that Facebook and, especially, Vkontakte has. Both of them provide almost all content that some may enjoy: from music to films that even could be free. Russian version of Facebook also has online games inside. But, of course, the main point why second group consider social media entertain: chatting. Both websites provide us with new distinct mean of socializing. I, personally, support both ideas because I use Vkontakte for entertainment and for finding some chart of information that I used sometimes. The development of both that supposes will allow social networks to be the main part of the life for many people all over the world.
