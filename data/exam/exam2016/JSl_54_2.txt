Nowadays air pollution is an essential problem, that must be solved. Only people are blame for such consequences. Some people think that we travel too much and government must protect our environment from wastes. To my mind, we must use our resources carefully, effectively and we must appreciate our planet. To begin with, people should control their behavior. We should not fly too much. Secondly, government can encourage such action by putting taxes on flight. For example, if someone travel a lot, he must pay for each extra flight more that previous. Thirdly, our government must control gas emissions, it should subsidies projects which are devoted to reduce wastes and recycling poisons. However, we life in a very busy world, where people have to much responsibilities. They need to travel by air, because it is comfortable and sharply. To sum it up, I am sure that we must control our growing wishes and help to save our planet from air polution, greenhouse effect.
