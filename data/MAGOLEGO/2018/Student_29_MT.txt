A few West Coast tech giants have become a serious threat to our basic freedoms and the democratic well-being of all of us.
I believe that Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google, though have many benefits, have also caused many problems in different spheres of our life. The main reason why I believe in this opinion because they control our data, warp our democratic discourse and exert increasing dominance over our markets.
I agree with Luke Johnson, in today's world advertisement has become a significant tool for marketing a product. Google and Facebook together dominate digital advertising and they are only getting bigger. They use our data. They advertise what we were looking for earlier. Of course, you can clear the search history, but in my experience, this does not help much.
Another reason I support the notion that copyright laws are breaking YouTube, is because it is unrealistic to control the entire flow of information, and often there is a violation of copyright. In addition, the internet did play a key role in the propagation of misinformation.
In conclusion, the issue, we have to be more active and aware. The power of these companies lies not just in their size, but also in the 21st centuryâ€™s most valuable asset, data, which the tech companies extract freely from us, the users.
