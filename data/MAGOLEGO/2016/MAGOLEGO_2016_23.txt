Augmented realities, cybersports, artificial intelligence, 3D printers or Google glasses – all these innovations can really scare a retired or a mean age person who is not involved in the sphere of new technologies. Nowadays many people prefer virtual life to the real one and as a consequence they properly suffer from numerous mental affections. But has the process of “technologization” such a negative impact on our civilization as it is told? I believe it is only a point of reasonable usage of the scientific advances and an individual choice of every person.

As an example we can consider a situation in medicine field. It is not a secret that a lot of incredibly complicated operations now are available only due to high-technological science and its constant development. Laparoscopic surgery, surgery made by robots and laser medicine – we can easily continue this list of innovations. We remember an inspiring speech of Eric Dishman during the TED conference. Eric is a patient who was told to have only 2 or 3 years to live when he was young but thanks to the new technologies and the medicine achievements now, in his middle ages, he lives with the imported kidney and spreads the idea of reinventing health care. According to his proposals, there are three essential points of patient’s successful and long life: care anywhere, care networking and care customization. Now Dishman’s doctor can always take care of him owning to the internet connections, online technologies and portable ultrasound devices. At the same time Eric himself is able to practice active way of life, go skiing or be at home with his family but not be in hospital. It is a fascinating progress of our XXI century, isn’t it? 

To sum up, the nearest future will change positively and this alteration is only up to us. We construct the model of our existence ourselves and only we decide to create an intelligent life and make its offline version better than its possible virtual analogue.
