All walks of life - sports, education, health care and many others - are going to change dramatically in the nearest future with the coming of new technologies.
New technologies are developing in the all fields of life. They make an opportunity for people to communicate in any time, any place and in any way they want. And they make possible to get instantly any information person want to know. 
All people are impressed by google glass, anthropomorphous robots, virtual reality and wearable devices. However, these technologies are not developing as fast as many people think. For example, the best Japan humanlike robot is really awesome. It can take subjects, run and jump using only one leg. But this robot is one of a kind, it costs tens of millions dollars and it need to be serviced by team of engineers. Also I am not sure if it can work autonomous for many hours. Not so unique, serial and cheaper robots can be useful only in the limited areas.
Virtual reality, or augmented reality is very promising innovation. And two most admired devices are Oculus Rift and Google glass. Oculus Rift is like huge screen in 3D and only gives a bit deeper dive. Project Google glass has closed for more thorough developing, because it did not become as popular as expected.
Most new technologies are inseparably linked with the internet. So it makes these technologies useless in non-developed countries and regions. 
No doubt all walks of life are changing and no one can stop it. And dramatic changes will happen but not in the nearest future. Many examples of todayâ€™s great innovations are unique and they needs a lot of time before they become ubiquitous.
