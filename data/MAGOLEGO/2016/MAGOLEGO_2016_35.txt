New technologies for sports:
Nowadays, we have many sports such as swimming, cycling, rowing, and tennis and so on. Many of them, I would like to mention about cycling. This sport is my favorite one. At top speed, ninety percent of cyclists emerged is spent to counter air resistance. Runner’s energy is used to counter air-resistance by comparison of runner’s and cyclist’s energy. Cycling can reduce effort on a cyclist by up to 38 percent. Most cycling teams already practice this technique, but nowadays cyclists are finding new ways to reduce air-resistance.
The wheels of a bicycle have a big effect on the airflow during a bike. Bicycles are approaching the bound of how thin they can be. The positive effects of cycling as a mode of transport may be even greater than individual benefits when you factor in the reduction of pollution and traffic accidents that occur when there are fewer cars on the roads. The cycling is on the best forms of aerobic exercise, along with walking. 
New technologies for education:

Technology in education is demonstrated the use of computers. This is also a great time they are facing their class. This technology is very essential for both students and the teacher. But there are some instances where in this technology to be disadvantages for both of them as well.
