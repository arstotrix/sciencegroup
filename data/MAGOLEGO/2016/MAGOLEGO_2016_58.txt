All walks of life - sports, education, health care and many others - are going to change dramatically in the nearest future with the coming of new technologies.

What is a new technologies? It’s something a new, unknown, frightening. I’m shure, that a plan were same think for primitive people in former time. But if they  knew how the plan made human life either. They didn’t know about this, and they freighted.
Today we can’t imagine our live without new technologies. Communication with relatives, for example,  do not require such a long wait. Without them, human life is no longer possible, Internet, Online TV, Internet radio is even in the most remote corners of the planet. Technology is changing and developing our lives.  Now we can talk about the printers that can print second heart or kidney.  It’s a great magic, which can save lives to many mothers, fathers, children. husbands, wives..
Of course, a history knows many examples, where the new technologies led to dire consequence, for example, the gun, H-bomb, Chernobyl.  But still had a lot more good think. The development often comes with side effects. Such disaster occurred only because of the human factor. The only thing that scares me in such side effects is research and development of artificial intelligence. It seemed to Pete Thiel: "genetic engineering must deal with good people." And this is unfortunately mankind can not control. But history shows that society eventually stopping the spread of such effects. Will hope on this.
So I think that new technologies it’s a necessary condition of our future.  And a value of this it’s make a life easier to access to safe and so on.
