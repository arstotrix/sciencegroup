All walks of life – sports, education, health care and many others – are going to change dramatically in the nearest future with the coming of new technologies

Being in a different corner that I cannot follow the information on the email document sent by our assistants, I’ll follow my own vision on all the new technologies that I’m following in the last years. Once I’m in such situation/opportunity to deliver my original point of view on all walks of life listed in the motion of the present essay, I can confirm that my perception varies from education to health, from the sport’s to many others walks of life it’s demanding and a long way in the resent concept of “new technologies”.
First of all, is needed to understand the necessity of new technologies and way it is a need to be developed for the future human life. Now in the beginning of understanding, we can do a wrong choice to use new technologies for example to use in excess social platforms as www.facebook.com, or others platforms that can periodically replace some needs. Why are necessary!? How can influence to change “dramatically” all human walks of live!? Let’s make my ideas clear in the order they been announced in the motion:
New technologies in sport – “are man-made means developed to reach human interests or goals in or relating to a particular sport.  Technology in sports is a technical means by which athletes attempt to improve their training and competitive surroundings in order to enhance their overall athletic performance.”  
Advantages 
-	knowledge and application of using specialized equipment 
-	modern technologies to perform tasks
-	more efficiently
-	athletic health can be maintained and observed
Disadvantages 
-	drugs
-	time taken for playback
-	could lead to increase injury or violence
-	could be expensive
-	reduces traditional ethic or nature of sport
A new technology in education – technology in education plays an important role in improving the educational skills and knowledge of the people. This is very important especially those who need improve their knowledge in order for them to achieve a successful life in the future. Technology in education is manifested through the use of computers.
Advantages
-	promotes independent learning for the students
-	easier access to information
-	promotes exciting way to educate students
Disadvantages 
-	laziness in studying
-	forgetting the basic way of studying
-	discovering unusual things in the computer
New technologies in health – have the potential to transform the health care system from a mostly paper-based industry to one that utilizes clinical and other pieces of information to assist providers in delivering higher quality of care to their patients. 
Advantage
-	Care anywhere- Now the smartphones that we're already carrying can clearly have diagnostic devices like ultrasounds plugged into them, and a whole array of others, today, and as sensing is built into these, we'll be able to do vital signs monitor and behavioral monitoring like we've never had before. 
-	Care networking - Now, if we've got all these networked devices that are helping us to do care anywhere, it stands to reason that we also need a team to be able to interact with all of that stuff. 
-	And care customization - if you've got care anywhere and you've got care networking, those are going to go a long way towards improving our health care system, but there's still too much guesswork. 
Disadvantages 
-	The electronic health record is compatibility and interoperability across different health information systems.
-	Electronic health records require a standardized system and technology to promote.
-	financial issues
-	changes in workflow
-	privacy and security concerns
As we can see that all new technologies have as much advantages as disadvantages and can easily improve human future life. Now we are in the developing era where the entire “new” can negatively influent our life as we can be a subjects of study. The only need of humans is to understand and to use it to increase their life.
