Augmented reality (AR) is a physical world whose elements are changed by computer technologies such as video, graphics or GPS data. For some years ago there was a huge debate about its impact on society, but today AR is becoming mainstream. We can increasingly augment our reality with rich data sources using media which appear so faster and are manipulated by a mere virtual flick of the wrist. It's a really uniquely blended interactive experience which we've never had before!
In the near future, AR means that for the every moment in our life and for the everything, that we see, we will instantly can get  huge amounts of information on them.
Some of this AR applications already used, for example, for military purposes now  and could soon be integrated into our everyday lives. Video games, medicine, education, socialization and marketing are just some of the areas which have already begun to be influenced by AR.
For example, AR applications have already been successfully used in surgical operations, and educational materials used in museums and schools with vivid 3D recreations using these technologies (for example, https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/collection/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art ).
However, some negative sides of AR have already been discussed by experts. These range from the very practical to more theoretical and ethical considerations.
The main problem is privacy. AR will make it more difficult for us to keep personal information private. But, maybe the concept of privacy may become an anachronism in the nearest future. In addition, we will be continually getting huge amounts of information which we might not be able to process adequately. This cognitive overload is another challenge which we will undoubtedly have in the coming era in of AR, where these techololgies will be just as commonplace as cell phones are today.
